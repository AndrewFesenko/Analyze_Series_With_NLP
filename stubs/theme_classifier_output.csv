1,"A Village Out in the Boonies: Hage
 Here we go again...
 There, there...
 There you are.
 Those two finally calmed down.
 Are they brothers... or perhaps twins?
 No, they're not.
 This one is rather calm, but this one...
 seems like he has a lot of spunk.
 First of all, they don't look a thing alike.
 Hm? ""Yuno""...
 Let's see. And the spunky one over here is—
 Hey! You're a bit too spunky...
 ""Asta,"" eh?
 Right! You two don't need to  worry about a thing anymore.
 Starting today, this is your new home...
 Asta, Yuno.
 15 Years Later
 Hopefully, we'll have a  great harvest this year.
 Yeah.
 Hup.
 Sister Lily!
 What the...
 Must be that runt from the church again.
 I'll become the Wizard King  someday and make you happy!
 So please marry me!
 I'm sorry, Asta, but I'm everyone's sister.
 Not yet!
 Um... I'm sorry.
 I'm not giving up yet!
 Er, um... But...
 I'm not giving up!
 I'm really sorry!
 One more time, Sister Lily!
 Stop pestering me!
 Water Creation Magic: Holy Fist of Love!
 I-I'm sorry, Asta.
 I used magic from my  grimoire without thinking...
 Well done, sister.
 No mercy whatsoever.
 I-I... It just happened..
 I'm not done yet!
 Sheesh.
 How many times does she have to dump you?
 Why are you getting in my way too, Yuno?!
 Why?
 Because you're loud, short,
 Loud
 Short
 obnoxious, and immature.
 Obnoxious
 Immature
 Basically, you're not appealing to women in any way.
 Not appealing
 Hey! Is that what you say to  someone you've grown up with
 for the past fifteen years, you handsome jerk?!
 Let me give you a hand.
 Thanks.
 Don't ignore me, damn it!
 Asta, Sister Lily is a woman of the cloth, so she can't get married.
 Also, you're only fifteen, so you can't get married anyway.
 Shut up! Yuno, you jerk... I oughta...
 I challenge you to a fight, Yuno!
 And I decline.
 Why the hell not?!
 Because it's a waste of time.
 What'd you say?!
 Give it a rest, Asta. There's no way you can beat Yuno.
 Take this...
 My ultimate...
 Hold up, Asta.
 Attack!
 I mean, you can't even use magic.
 Nothing came out!
 I'm not done yet!
 You're funny, Asta!
 You have zero sense.
 It's hard to believe someone your age can't use magic yet.
 The hell's your problem?! How dare  you speak to your elders that way?!
 Shut up.
 Magic is everything in this world.
 It's only natural to be able to use magic.
 You're the only one I've ever  seen who can't use it, Asta.
 G-Guess I don't have a choice...
 I'll have to show you what  I'm really made of...
 What you're really made of?
 How you like that?! I know you  can't do sit-ups this fast!
 What's your point, you idiot?
 You're funny, Asta!
 Yuno's so cool!
 That's Yuno for you.
 He's such a great help.
 Then leave... the wood-chopping...
 to me!
 I still can't believe you  two are the same age.
 Yuno is the hope of this church!
 I won't be surprised if you end up joining
 the Magic Knights who serve the Wizard King, Yuno!
 The awarding ceremony is coming up, Asta.
 Once you receive your grimoire,
 it should trigger something within you,  and you should be able to use magic, too.
 Sister...
 At least, I think so.
 I'll get my grimoire soon...
 Finally... Finally!
 I'll get a grimoire that's more  amazing than anyone else's,
 get into the Magic Knights, follow in your footsteps,
 and become the Wizard King!
 There he goes again.
 And I'll fix up this shabby, ugly church!
 Well, I'm sorry it's so shabby and ugly!
 Right, Yuno?
 Right?
 Just you wait...
 Just you wait, damn it!
 Asta, wait!
 Is he really older than me?
 Say, Yuno... Couldn't you  be a bit nicer to Asta?
 Like you used to be. Remember how you two  were always together when you were little?
 Yuno used to be such a crybaby,
 but ever since the day he brought Asta back with those terrible injuries,
 Yuno hasn't cried at all.
 I can't be nicer to him.
 Come to think of it, Asta has come home covered in mud ever since that day, too.
 I wonder what he's doing out there...
 994... 995, 996,
 997, 998, 999... 1,000!
 And now for this moguro leaf juice, which is supposed to be
 good for increasing magical powers!
 I'm going to become the Wizard King.
 That's the one thing I'll never give up on!
 But before that, I need to build myself up!
 March... When firefly dandelion fluff  starts to dance through the air.
 Once a year, all around the Clover Kingdom,  all of the 15-year-olds are gathered,
 Grimoire Tower
 and an awarding ceremony  is held, where they receive
 their own grimoires, which  enhance their magical powers.
 Wow!
 A-Are all of these grimoires?
 Which one is mine?
 Once I get my grimoire, I'm sure  I'll be able to use magic, too.
 I'll catch up to Yuno in no time!
 Hmph. I guess today's the day I become a full-fledged mage.
 Hey, look over there.
 Pathetic, isn't it? They shouldn't have  to give grimoires to dregs like that.
 You said it.
 Don't tell me they're
 actually planning on taking the  Magic Knights' entrance exams, too.
 Only nobles born with immense magical power or ties to the royal family ever get in.
 Besides, I heard that shrimp can't even use magic!
 Wow... Then we need to take good care of him.
 He's like a national treasure, since he's probably
 the only one in this whole  kingdom who can't use magic.
 Welcome, young men and women.
 You all begin a new journey today.
 I wish you all faith, hope, and love.
 I am the master of this grimoire tower.
 We've never had a Wizard King from this area,
 nor anyone who's actually achieved  greatness in the Magic Knights.
 I sincerely hope that one of you  will become the Wizard King someday.
 No, really! Seriously!
 Ahem.
 Now it's time
 for the awarding... of the grimoires!
 This is my grimoire?
 Check it out! Mine's bigger!
 Mine's thicker, though.
 All right! Now I can leave  this town and go to the city.
 I'm gonna take over the family business.
 This is my grimoire?
 Mine's like...
 I'll... think about my future more once  my grimoire has more pages filled in.
 We'll be taking the Magic Knights'  entrance exams in six months.
 We'll be sure to get in.
 Good, good. I look forward to it.
 Um...
 My grimoire's not coming.
 Um...
 My grimoire's not coming.
 Er...
 Try again next year.
 What?!
 What the heck?!
 That's actually amazing!
 That's way too funny!
 Seriously?
 I can't believe it.
 If we competed to see who was most pathetic, we'd be no match for that guy.
 A four-leaf clover...
 A four-leaf? You mean the legendary...
 H-Hey...
 The one that the first Wizard King received?
 The grimoire said to be filled  with immense power and good luck?
 Him?
 That peasant?
 Wow!
 I'm going to become the Wizard King.
 Awesome!
 He's the shining star of Hage!
 You're amazing, Yuno!
 He's so cool.
 Yuno...
 Just you wait.
 I'll catch up to you in no time.
 Because I'm your rival!
 Did he just say ""rival""?
 He didn't even get a grimoire.  What is he thinking?
 Not possible.
 All right, kids! We're heading  home to prepare for the feast!
 You can each have three tatoes today!
 Yay!
 I sure would like to eat something  else once in a while.
 What an amazing thing to find  in a crummy little town like this.
 I thought that once I got my grimoire,
 I'd be able to use magic, but...
 I never thought I wouldn't even get one.
 But... like hell I'm gonna give up!
 Don't you dare underestimate me, fate!
 I'll show you!
 Even if it takes one, two,  ten, or a hundred years!
 I'll keep working hard  until I get my grimoire!
 I'll become the Wizard King, and prove  to everyone that anyone can be awesome,
 even if they're poor or just some orphan!
 You jerk!
 Just you wait, Yuno!
 H-Hey, you don't have to go that far.
 We should've been the stars today.
 And yet... this peasant receives  a four-leaf clover?!
 I'll just...
 Hey!
 I'll just have to turn it into ash!
 He held back my flames without  even using his grimoire?!
 D-Do something!
 But...
 Do it!
 I can't let you go and burn that.
 Don't bother to resist.
 My Creation Magic: Binding Iron Chain
 restricts the magic and movements  of the one it captures.
 Who are you?
 Until recently, I was a pretty well-known  Magic Knight called Revchi of Chain Magic.
 But I got kicked out, so now  I'm just a wretched thief.
 And I'll be taking that grimoire.
 Revchi, was it? It's pointless  for you to steal that.
 The only one—
 The only one who can use a  grimoire is the one it chose.
 However, underground collectors  are buying grimoires
 with four-leaf clovers for insane prices.
 A four-leaf clover may have chosen you,
 but you only just received it. You're still just a little chick.
 How unfortunate for you that  I happened to be here.
 Your legend is going to end  before it even begins.
 Hey, that pendant looks like  it's worth something, too.
 I guess I'll be taking that...
 Hold it!
 What do you think you're doing?!
 I've come to save...
 Huh?
 Who the hell are you?!
 That's Yuno's grimoire!
 Why do you have it? You thief!
 Aren't you the pathetic little brat  who wasn't even given a grimoire?
 Oh, you remember me!
 Yeah, I'm that pathetic little brat!
 A grimoire is precious to  the person who received it!
 Give it back to Yuno, you jerk!
 The outside world is a place where crooked  deeds like this can be overlooked.
 But you'll be dead before you find that out for yourself.
 Asta, run!
 I'm not going to run away
 from a disgraced loser like him!
 I'm not done yet!
 No... You're finished.
 Dance of the Pitless Viper!
 Wh-What a heavy blow...
 So this is the power of the mages  from outside this town.
 I can't possibly beat him  with just my physical training.
 Thank you for that useless struggle, brat.
 Not yet. I'm not finished...
 I'm going to be... the Wizard King.
 You? The Wizard King?
 I have the ability to find out
 just how much magical power  one has with these chains.
 And you have no magic whatsoever.
 You must've been born that way. No wonder you couldn't get a grimoire.
 To think that you lack even an ounce of magic
 in this world where magic is everything.
 What a priceless find!
 Huh?
 What the hell?
 Then no matter how hard I try,  I won't be able to use magic?
 To think that someone so pathetic existed.
 You won't even be able to find a job,  let alone become the Wizard King!
 I'm sure your friend, the great  genius over there, mocks you, too.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Yuno's so amazing that he  was chosen by the four-leaf.
 I'm just...
 You can't do a thing in this world.  Just give up on everything.
 You were born a loser!
 He's right.
 No matter how hard I try,  some things just can't be helped.
 I'm just going to give...
 Hey!
 Who are you calling a loser?
 Asta, it's true that you won't be  able to become the Wizard King,
 no matter what.
 You hear that? Even your little friend  is telling you it's impossible.
 That's because I'm going  to become the Wizard King!
 What?
 He's no loser.
 He's...
 Asta's my rival!
 Huh?
 Him? Your rival?
 This brat who has no  magical power whatsoever?
 Not... Not yet.
 Sorry you had to see me  looking that pathetic, Yuno.
 Just a sec...
 I'm gonna kick this guy's butt!
 A gri... moire?
 I knew it.
 There's no way that Asta  wouldn't have been chosen!
 Your magic?
 But you didn't have any magic within you!
 What in the world is that grimoire?!
 The three leaves of the clover  represent faith, hope, and love.
 Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.
 Within a fifth leaf...
 resides a demon.
 Asta and Yuno
 Grey words can't make anything happen
 I know, yeah I know
 Wishing to fly freely across the sky
 I dreamed it all my life
 Step by step I go, though  it's a doubtful world 
 Don't care how much I fall
 Instinct is my guide, I never give up
 To faraway future, I burst out running
 Go beyond even the unseen fears
 The vision I had, so I can be myself
 Someday I will write the next page
 You are my hope
 Like that page from someday
 I was able to meet you
 I call this a miracle
 I'm not going to give up just  because I can't use magic!
 It doesn't matter if you're a peasant or an orphan! Anyone can shine in this world!

 10 Years Ago
 W-Wait!
 Yuno! Are you okay?!
 Come on, Yuno.
 Asta...
 Jeez. You're such a crybaby, Yuno.
 Well...
 It's okay!
 I've got your back, Yuno! Okay?
 Yeah.
 All right. Let's get going.
 Everyone's waiting at the top!
 It's good, but...
 It's hard.
 That's our Sister Lily.
 You're such an amazing cook!
 When I grow up, will you  marry me and cook for me?
 It was Father who baked those.  Would you like to marry him?
 No! You're the one I wanna marry!
 Sister! Marry me! Marry me! Marry me!
 Marry me! Marry me! Marry me!
 Very good.
 Asta, it's not possible.
 Sister is, um... a woman of the cloth.
 I'm not done yet, Yuno! I won't give up  until I'm an adult, no matter what!
 Well, good luck with that.
 ""And then the world was covered  in deep, deep darkness.
 Just when the demon tried  to destroy the world...""
 He's not gonna get away with that!
 ""...a very brave mage appeared.
 The brave mage fought the demon  to bring the dawn back to the world.
 And finally, he defeated the demon.
 The mage's light shone ever so brightly upon the whole world.
 The long, long night had come to an end.
 This was the dawn of our world.""
 Yes!
 ""And so, the mage was dubbed the  Wizard King and became a legend.""
 The Wizard King...
 ""And they all lived happily ever after.""
 Hey, Sister.
 The Wizard King still exists, right?
 Yes.
 The title of ""Wizard King"" has been passed down through many generations.
 All along, they've been protecting us with their magic.
 It's because of the Wizard King that the Clover Kingdom is so peaceful.
 That's awesome!
 Is the Wizard King really important?
 He's the most important after the king.
 Okay, I've made up my mind!
 About what, Asta?
 I'm... gonna be the Wizard King!
 Sister?
 I'm sorry. I just wasn't expecting that.
 What brought this on?
 Well, he defeated the demon, right?
 That means he's super strong! And that's so cool!
 I wanna be cool, too!
 And...
 If I become important... If I become the Wizard King,
 I'll be able to make everyone  even happier, right?
 You'll be able to wear nice clothes  and eat all the good food you want!
 I'm gonna make this crappy  little church huge and amazing!
 Crappy?
 I'll get you whatever you want, too, Sister!
 I'll look forward to it.
 Right, Yuno?
 Yeah.
 The Wizard King...
 I'm gonna be the Wizard King!
 So, Sister! Marry me—
 That's a completely different subject.
 Not yet! I won't give up!
 No.
 Not yet, yet, yet, yet!
 No.
 December
 Why?!
 Why is it I still can't use magic?!
 Sister! I'll hang up the laundry!
 Thanks, Asta.
 So marry m—
 No.
 Mar—
 Nope.
 Mar—
 No.
 Marry me, please...
 Don't you start crying, too, Yuno.
 Nash... won't stop crying...
 Yuno! Leave this to me!
 Asta...
 I'm gonna be the Wizard King, after all!
 Making a baby or two stop  crying is a piece of cake!
 H-Hey! There, there! There, there, there!
 There, there.
 Way to go, Wizard King.
 Shut up.
 There we go.
 Hi there. I was wondering if one  of you would run an errand for me.
 Me! Me! Me! Me, me!
 I'll go!
 Would someone deliver this to the mayor?
 Me, me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
 It's a very important letter, you see...
 Yuno, could you do it?
 Huh? Me?
 Well, it's a very important letter,
 and I'm hesitant to leave it in Asta's  hands, so I'm counting on you.
 I have to go see the mayor  in the next village over.
 I have to ask him to spare us some  food to make it through the winter.
 As it stands now, we just  don't have enough tatoes.
 Yuno, I'll go!
 No. Father asked me to go.
 I-I'll go.
 Will you be okay by yourself?
 I'll be fine.
 I'm heading out!
 Come on, Asta. Chop some wood.
 You can't use magic, so at  least do some manual labor.
 Shut up! Did you even dig up the  tatoes you were supposed to?
 I dug up the ones for  today a long time ago.
 Huh?!
 It looks like it's going  to get chilly tonight.
 That's enough! Get out of my shop!
 The hell are you doing?!
 If you want to drink any more,  you gotta bring some cash.
 You ain't getting any for free!
 I don't want your stupid  booze anyway, you jerk!
 Damn it...
 Whoa...
 Ow...
 The snow's getting pretty thick. I'll have to be careful not to slip.
 Oh, thank you. Please tell  Father that I received it.
 I will. P-Please excuse me.
 It's late, so be careful getting home!
 Thank you very much!
 I'm... sorry.
 Yuno's taking an awfully long time.
 I'm hungry.
 And Father isn't back yet, either.
 Let's just eat without them.
 No! That's not fair to Yuno!
 Boo.
 My pendant... That's mine...
 I'm just gonna exchange it for some cash.
 Give it back...
 You miserable little brat. Where do you get off having something this extravagant?
 Give it... back...
 Give it back...
 That's mine...
 What the heck is that?
 What do you expect to do  to me with magic like that?
 You want to fight me...
 and die?
 Yuno!
 Who the hell are you, brat?
 That's Yuno's!
 Give it back!
 Give it back!
 Give it back!
 Don't touch me with your filthy hands!
 You... stupid little brat!
 Not yet!
 Not yet!
 Cut it out!
 I'm not done yet!
 Damn it!
 I'm not done yet!
 Damn little brat just won't give up. What the hell's his problem?
 Asta!
 I'm sorry. I... I...
 Don't worry about it.
 I told you, I've got your back.
 Asta...
 Asta's always done the unthinkable.
 Wh-What is that grimoire?
 That sword!
 Just who are you?!
 You little wretch with no magical powers!
 He... nullified my magic?
 Even without magical powers...
 I'm going to become the Wizard King!
 Not giving up...
 is my magic!
 I built up my muscles since I couldn't use any magic.
 Looks like they came in handy after all.
 Asta...
 Asta, are you okay?
 I'm so sorry. It's all  my fault... I'm sorry...
 This is nothin'!
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King.
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King...  and protect you and everyone else.
 I'm gonna make everyone even happier!  So we can have even nicer things!
 And then, I'm gonna prove to everyone...
 Prove?
 That even if you're poor... or an orphan...
 you can still become the Wizard King.
 We can?
 Yeah.
 Can we really?
 Anyone can... if they work hard enough!
 Anyone?
 Me, or even you, Yuno!
 I'll... never cry again.
 Maybe I... no...
 Yuno?
 I will...
 I'll become the Wizard King, too!
 I'll get stronger, and protect  you and everyone else!
 I'm gonna make everyone happier!  So we can have nicer things!
 Yuno! Look, look! I got my own grimoire!
 It's insanely shabby, but I'm gonna take  good care of it for the rest of my life!
 There, there, there, there, there.  There, there, there, there.
 I guess...
 you saved me again.
 I'll repay you for this someday.
 Asta...
 Do you remember our promise?
 So you're gonna become the Wizard King, too?
 That means...
 Yuno, you're...
 Asta, you're...
 ...my rival!
 You mean you remember it?
 I thought you were just making fun of me.
 I have no interest in being  too friendly with my rival.
 But you're the one who gave me hope.
 Even if you're poor, an orphan...
 or even us...
 We can become greater than anyone  else in this world. And to prove that...
 To make Sister and everyone else happy...
 Let's see who can become the Wizard King!
 No one can escape from here
 Once again in the small closed off classroom
 The star of the class was shining yet again
 They shine so bright that I close my eyes
 I've thought many times
 That the revolution was within my hands
 Isn't it strange? If you want  to laugh, go ahead and laugh
 The rest of us who were left  behind wanted to become something
 We repeat the same morning over and over
 You're the only one who  can choose your tomorrow
 Let's go beyond our current selves
 Even though I can't use magic, I'm going to join the Magic Knights!
 So that I can become the Wizard King!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Clover Kingdom Royal Capital
 Time has passed, and the title
 of the Wizard King has been  passed down through generations.
 The Wizard King commands the Magic Knights, and they protect the kingdom together.
 The Magic Knights are comprised of nine squads of mages
 that specialize in combat, all under  the command of the Wizard King.
 This band of heroes protects  the kingdom with their lives.
 To become the Wizard King or a Magic Knight  is the aspiration of all in the Clover Kingdom.

 I should wrap up for today.
 No, just a little bit more.

 But are you really considering allowing  Asta to take the exam, too?
 Well, he's saying he wants to do it.
 And the ones I was counting on...
 W-We can't do it...
 We can't become Magic Knights!
 If someone who was kicked out of  the Magic Knights was that strong...
 There's no way!
 We're sorry!
 ...decided against taking the exam.
 Again, I believe Yuno will be fine,  but I don't think Asta's up for it.
 Well, he's saying he wants to do it.
 Again, I believe Yuno will be fine, but it'll be pointless for Asta to take them.
 Well, he's saying he wants to do it.
 Actually, the idea of Asta going to the royal capital just makes you feel lonely, doesn't it?
 Aw, Father!
 Th-That's not...
 I just believe that if he's  going to fail anyway,
 he's better off not taking  it in the first place.
 A-And you know... The little  ones will miss him, too.
 Not me! But they'll have one  less person to play with!
 Why are you looking at me like that?
 Not you, too, Tower Master!
 Well, I'll feel a little lonely with  both Yuno and Asta gone, Father.
 Well, of course, I raised them, and I've lived  with them ever since they were babies.
 I'd be lying if I said I wasn't  a bit sad to see them go.
 If possible, I'd like for them  to stay at the church.
 But I also want to let them  do what they want to do.
 Indeed.
 Besides, you know... Yuno will be fine,
 and Asta might fail the exam  and come right back anyway.
 Y-You're right. Right!
 Yuno will be fine, but the  other one will come right back.
 Um... The book that Asta obtained...
 Is it truly a grimoire?
 Asta can't use magic. How was  he able to obtain a grimoire?
 I'm not sure.
 But that's...
 Yes?
 No...
 Look! Look!
 My very own grimoire!
 I don't even know how,  but I was able to get one!
 The five-leaf clover... It couldn't be.
 Training's not over until  I'm back at the church!
 Eat my dust!
 Goal!
 Yuno! Asta!
 Welcome back.
 Wh-Who got here faster?
 Hmm... Yuno was just a tiny bit faster.
 Seriously?! Were you even looking?!
 Then I'll race you into the church!
 I win.
 Yuno can be pretty childish sometimes.
 Yeah, I mean, getting so worked  up over Asta, of all people?
 Not to mention, Yuno...
 How many years will this last us?
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King.
 Yuno?
 Did you come to watch me train?
 Nash?
 What's up?
 Nothing. I was just bored.
 I just came by to make fun of the  idiot doing something idiotic.
 Whaddya mean, idiotic?!
 Well, it is!
 You can't even use magic, and you're going  to take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam?
 Of course you're going to fail!
 That's not decided yet!
 Just look!
 I even got a grimoire!
 I'm gonna get into the Magic Knights!
 And then, one day, I'll become the Wizard Ki—
 That's never gonna happen!
 Orphans like us, who are poor...  aren't allowed to dream like that.
 Nash...
 You can't give up right from the get-go!
 Possibilities exist in everyone!
 Shut up! They do not!
 No, they do! I'm going to  keep chasing my dream!
 It doesn't matter if you're  poor or an orphan.
 Anyone in this world can become amazing.
 They can do anything.
 They can make their dreams come true.
 They can make everyone happy!
 And I'll prove that to you!
 Prove?
 I'm going to join the Magic Knights
 and become the Wizard King!
 Tomorrow's the day Asta and Yuno  set out for the royal capital.
 We have to send them off with a bang!
 Father went to all the surrounding  villages asking for tatoes.
 Father!
 What's that look for? This isn't just for you!
 Actually, it's mostly for Yuno.
 Father!
 Well, you know... Yuno might make it  into the Magic Knights, but you're...
 Father!
 Asta, there's no need to be embarrassed,  even if you fail the exam.
 Huh?
 No one believes you're going to pass, anyway.
 Are you trying to encourage  me or make fun of me?!
 You can come back at any time.
 Your home is this church.
 No matter how crappy or poor  it may be, it's your home.
 That's right, Asta.
 I'll be lonely without Asta here.
 Yuno, too.
 We're all family.
 Y-You should say that to Yuno, too.
 Tell him he can come back whenever he wants.
 Yuno will be fine.
 What do you mean?! Besides, I'll be fine, too!
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King!
 And then... I'm gonna come back for Sister!
 So when that happens, marry m—
 All right, let's eat.
 We have stewed tatoes, tato tempura, grilled tatoes,
 fried tatoes, stir-fried  tatoes, steamed tatoes,
 Hage-style boiled tatoes, tato juice,  and even special tato pudding!
 Yay! Let's eat!
 So flaky and delicious!
 Yummy!
 Hey, that's mine!
 Don't eat it all yourself, Asta!
 So good!
 Take care.
 You better write us, Yuno.
 Sure.
 Good luck!
 Come back soon!
 He'll be back soon... Asta, that is.
 Nash!
 But you know...
 If, just if, and it's a very huge if...
 If you get into the Magic Knights...
 Yeah?
 I'll believe in possibilities.  I'll believe I can become anything.
 And then one day, I'll get into  the Magic Knights, too.
 No, never mind.
 I'll be waiting for you.
 Well, I'll be off.
 Hey, wait, Yuno!
 Answer me, you handsome jerk!
 Just because we're rivals doesn't  mean we can't get along!
 Hey!
 Well, bye, guys!
 Have a safe trip!
 See ya.
 Yuno and Asta... You've both grown so much.
 Asta's always been full of energy.
 This is Sister Lily. She'll be  working here starting today.
 All of you, be kind to her.
 Wow... Sister Lily.
 Yes?
 Please marry me!
 I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!
 Lily...
 He seems happy.
 It might be because of Asta...
 But Yuno's become so strong.
 Asta...
 He's so beaten up.
 It's all my fault.
 He was protecting me.
 What?
 Yuno, you sound so...
 Asta, stay with us!
 Sister Lily...
 Asta...
 Please marry me.
 Thank goodness.
 Do your best, you two.
 It is summer. Asta and Yuno start their  journey to the royal capital in order to take
 the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.
 The royal capital is a long,  long way from Hage Village.
 The royal capital, huh... I wonder what it's like.
 I wonder if we'll get  to meet the Wizard King!
 First, we need to pass the  Magic Knights entrance exam.
 Then we'll talk.
 I'm so excited!
 Excited? Aren't you scared?
 Huh? Why would I be?
 You never change.
 Come on, let's hurry! The royal capital's super far away!
 Hey.
 I've gotta hurry up and  become the Wizard King!
 Just because you get there quickly
 doesn't mean you'll become the  Wizard King any quicker.
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King, and...
 My, Asta, you look so impressive.
 Sister... no, my Lily.
 I came for you, just as I promised.
 I've become the Wizard King. Now, get on.
 Okay!
 Hold on tight!
 It could happen!
 Can you even ride a broom when  you don't have any magic?
 I-I'll make it work!
 Will you?
 I will! I got my grimoire!
 I can do anything as long as I don't give up!
 Come on, hurry up!
 I'm gonna leave you behind, Yuno!
 Let's train all the way to the royal capital!
 You can't be serious.
 Can't keep up, can you, Yuno?
 Not done yet... Not yet!
 Stop. We've got a long way to go.
 Not yet! I'm not done yet!
 Hot! Hot, hot, hot!
 I wish everyone back at the  church could eat this, too.
 Yeah.
 This way!
 No, it's this way.
 H-Hey, wait!
 Stay out of my way!
 I just gave you a hand.
 No one asked you to!
 All right!
 My precious moguro leaf juice!
 What's the matter, Yuno?
 Whoa, it's huge!
 So that's the royal capital.
 That's where the Wizard King is.
 All right! I'm gonna do this!
 I'll be right there! Just you wait!
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King!
 After a long and perilous journey,
 Asta and Yuno arrive at the royal  capital of the Clover Kingdom.
 The Magic Knights Entrance Exam awaits.
 They will now have to compete with many  powerful opponents and pass the exam!
 No one can escape from here
 Once again in the small closed off classroom
 The star of the class was shining yet again
 They shine so bright that I close my eyes
 I've thought many times
 That the revolution was within my hands
 Isn't it strange? If you want  to laugh, go ahead and laugh
 The rest of us who were left  behind wanted to become something
 We repeat the same morning over and over
 You're the only one who  can choose your tomorrow
 Let's go beyond our current selves
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 The Mystery of the Grimoire
 The Mystery of the Grimoire!
 Wait, what? We're small now?
 But man... Our grimoires  are totally different.
 He ignored me?
 A grimoire's size and thickness are  determined by its owner's style.
 All right! Let's compare grimoires!
 No.
 That thing's filthy
 No fair!
 You scared you're gonna lose?
 Not a chance.
 You're getting a big head just because  you're a little handsome, aren't you?
 Not a chance.
 This is it, Yuno! The Magic Knights  we admire so much are here!
 Our path to making our dream of becoming  the Wizard King come true starts here!

4,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Asta and Yuno arrived at the royal  capital of the Clover Kingdom.
 Everyone in the kingdom dreams  of becoming a Magic Knight.
 The Magic Knights Entrance Exam was about to begin.
 The Magic Knights Entrance Exam
 Grey words can't make anything happen
 I know, yeah I know
 Wishing to fly freely across the sky
 I dreamed it all my life
 Step by step I go, though  it's a doubtful world 
 Don't care how much I fall
 Instinct is my guide, I never give up
 To faraway future, I burst out running
 Go beyond even the unseen fears
 The vision I had, so I can be myself
 Someday I will write the next page
 You are my hope
 Like that page from someday
 I was able to meet you
 I call this a miracle
 The Clover Kingdom
 Castle Town Kikka
 Whoa, this is awesome!
 Awesome!
 They're fresh!
 One sec. It's almost done roasting.
 That looks so good!
 Wow! They have so many different  kinds of staves and items!
 But they're so expensive!
 It's so different from our village.
 Is that where the Wizard King is?
 And probably the king, too.
 So that means that'll be my castle someday.
 You mean mine.
 Don't worry. I'll let you live there, too.
 That's my line.
 There, there. Don't cry. Let's hurry  back and get ready to open up the shop.
 Reminds me of everyone back at the church.
 I'm sure Sister and the others are lonely now that I'm gone.
 Not a chance.
 Hey, Yuno!
 Hey!
 Ah, it's so nice and quiet.  What a relief to have Asta gone.
 Oh, there you go again.
 I-I really mean it!
 They've probably reached  the royal capital by now.
 I hope the Magic Knights Exam goes well.
 Me, too.
 Huh?
 N-Nothing!
 Asta, Yuno...
 Do your best.
 So where do they hold the  Entrance Exam, anyway?
 Probably over there.
 What is that?
 Grilled purple snake. It was super cheap.
 Anyone want some grilled purple snakes
 that I just happened to  catch somewhere or other?
 Want some?
 No.
 It's super nutritious and will  give you lots of energy!
 Not a chance. Let's go. This way.
 Do your best on the exam!
 You are the Clover Kingdom's hope!
 The future of the kingdom is in your hands!
 Stay focused!
 I'll do my best!
 You don't know him...  You don't know him...
 You're #163. All right, next.
 I'm Yuno from Hage Village.
 Yuno from Hage... Could I see your grimoire?
 A f-four-leaf clover...
 So that's who everyone's talking about.
 Hey, that grimoire...
 Is it really a four-leaf clover?!
 Wow...
 You're #164. All right, next.
 I'm Asta, also from Hage Village! Here's my grimoire!
 This is pretty filthy.
 Is this really a grimoire?
 Huh? Of course it is! Take a good look!
 See? See?
 All right, all right...
 You're #165.
 Got it!
 All right!
 Bah-ha! He must be a real go-getter if he  came here all the way from the boonies.
 Man, I'm getting really nervous.
 Hey, ow! What the heck are these birds?!
 The infamous anti-birds of the exam venue.
 Really? These things?
 The weaker your magical powers,  the more these guys flock to you.
 Little pests...
 Hey, look at that guy.
 None of the birds are going to him.
 Hey! It's the guy from earlier.
 From earlier?
 He's from some remote village called Hage, yet he's got a four-leaf grimoire!
 Wha... A four-leaf? Seriously?
 One of us is going to become the Wizard King. Our legend's beginning now, Yuno!
 Wha...
 Become the Wizard King?
 I'm gonna show you just how much  I've grown in six months...
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 What the heck are these birds?!
 What's with that kid?
 Talk about a loser!
 That's pretty bad, even for  someone from the boonies.
 Get away from me, you stupid birds!
 They finally flew off somewhere.  Hey, sorry for bumping into you.
 I'll kill you, brat.
 What the heck's his problem?!
 Oh, crap. He's got the eyes of a killer.
 His neck's so thick! No mage looks like that!
 Talk about an intimidating presence!  Is he really my age?!
 No, wait, wait... You shouldn't  judge a book by its cover!
 Be friendly. Just be friendly.
 Man, you look old! You must've had a hard life!
 It appears you're ready to die.
 His looks weren't a lie at all!
 Oh, there he is! What are you doing down here?
 I'm about to end this little twerp's life.
 H-Hey... Isn't that...
 Is that the great Finral Roulacase?
 The user of rare spatial magic?
 Hey, you're cute.
 He's famous for being so girl-crazy that it gets in the way of his duties!
 And that's... Gordon Agrippa! The expert on incantation magic!
 I heard that he's impossible  to talk to... and also scary.
 Whoa, cut it out! A Magic Knights Squad  Captain shouldn't kill an exam candidate.
 Why did you even come down here, anyway?
 I went to take a dump and got lost.
 Squad Captain? You mean he's...
 The Lord of Destruction, Yami Sukehiro?!
 Ten... Nine... Eight...
 What're you counting down to?!
 The end of your life.
 Yami?! The Captain of the Black Bulls?
 The Black Bulls...
 The cost they incur in damages exceeds  the successes they're credited for, right?
 Apparently, there isn't a single  decent Magic Knight on that squad.
 A playboy and a guy who  can't communicate... I see.
 Yeah, I wouldn't want to join that squad.
 I picked the wrong guy to mess with!
 My head's seriously going to explode!
 One...
 Come on, the exam is about to start!
 Guess you get to live a little longer, brat.
 Better take good care of  the life you just got back.
 Or I'll kill you.
 What?!
 Bye!
 I wish the captain would kill me, too.
 Man, that sucked.
 Bah-ha! You okay?
 Y-Yeah...
 Must've been rough, having Captain Yami of the Black Bulls in your face like that.
 Oh, I'm Sekke. Sekke Bronzazza.
 Nice to meet you. Bah-ha!
 I'm Asta! Nice to meet you!
 Captain of the Silver Eagles Nozel Silva
 That's the Captain of the  Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva!
 That's...
 ...one of the captains of  the Magic Knights Squads.
 That's some hairstyle! Isn't it hard  to see with that thing in his face?
 Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings Fuegoleon Vermillion
 The Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings, Fuegoleon Vermillion.
 As the name ""Crimson"" suggests,
 he's a user of flame creation magic.
 Whoa...
 Captain of the Green Praying Mantises  Jack the Ripper
 The Captain of the Green Praying Mantises, Jack the Ripper.
 What's a praying mantis?
 You know, a mantis. Like, the bug.
 Apparently, Captain Jack's severing  magic can split the earth in two.
 Whoa, that's awesome.
 But I don't want to be a mantis. Bugs are super lame.
 Captain of the Blue Rose Knights Charlotte Roselei
 The Captain of the Blue Rose Knights, Charlotte Roselei.
 She's so beautiful.
 Yeah, but Sister Lily's prettier.
 Captain of the Purple Orcas Gueldre Poizot
 The Captain of the Purple Orcas, Gueldre Poizot.
 That's all?
 I have no interest in seamy guys like him.
 Captain of the Coral Peacocks Dorothy Unsworth
 The Captain of the Coral Peacocks, Dorothy Unsworth.
 Is she walking in her sleep?!
 Apparently, all she does is sleep.
 Then how'd she become a captain?
 She probably has an amazing power  you'd never expect her to possess.
 Captain of the Aqua Deer Rill Boismortier
 The Captain of the Aqua Deer, Rill Boismortier.
 Isn't he pretty young?
 Captain Rill is nineteen, I heard.
 Nineteen?! He's only four  years older than me?
 The path to becoming the Wizard King might be shorter than I thought!
 Bah-ha! Wizard King, eh?  That's a pretty big dream.
 But for the next Wizard King...
 They say he's the most promising candidate.
 The Captain of the most powerful  Magic Knights Squad, the Golden Dawn,
 Captain of the Golden Dawn William Vangeance
 William Vangeance.
 The members of his squad  have utmost faith in him,
 and it's said that in the last battle,
 it was Captain William who  took the enemy general's head.
 If only I could get into the Golden Dawn...
 The Silver Eagles would be great, too!
 You idiot. Only royal and noble elites make  it into the Golden Dawn and Silver Eagles.
 Captain of the Black Bulls Yami Sukehiro
 Pain in the ass... Can't we  just get this over with?
 This is an important exam that will  decide the futures of these youths.
 We need you to take  this a bit more seriously.
 Yeah, yeah, Mr. Serious.
 The captains are all gathered in one place.
 Wow...
 It is said that each of the Magic Knights
 Captains has the strength  of a hundred mages.
 One of these individuals will  become the next Wizard King.
 Where's the Wizard King?
 Bah-ha! The Wizard King wouldn't  bother coming down to the exam.
 It's a miracle in itself that all the  captains have gathered in one place.
 Candidates.
 Sorry to keep you waiting. I will be conducting this exam.
 Magic tree, descend!
 That's still amazing.
 So this is the man who's  closest to the Wizard King.
 We will now begin the Magic  Knights Entrance Exam.
 We will now have you all take several tests.
 The nine of us will evaluate  your performance,
 and then we will select the candidates  that we would like to add to our squads.
 If chosen, you will join that squad.
 If you're chosen by more than one squad,
 you may choose the squad  you would like to join.
 On the other hand, those who  are not chosen by any captain
 are not qualified to join the Magic Knights.
 I'm gonna get into the Magic Knights, no matter what!
 For the first exam, we will have  you get on those brooms and fly.
 But that's...
 I've never done that before.
 Mages who can control their magical powers  should be able to this instinctively.
 It is the most basic way for mages to travel.
 If you cannot fly on a broom,  you shouldn't even be here.
 All right, begin.
 Just by observing this, we can get a good  idea of what kind of mages they are.
 There are quite a few candidates this year.
 For a kid from the boonies,  he's really amazing.
 The genius chosen by the four-leaf...
 What's the meaning of this?
 No matter how much one might be lacking in talent, they should at least float.
 If you'll excuse me for a moment.
 Talk about pathetic.
 Guess we're down one rival already.
 What is he even doing here?
 Come on, this should be easy.
 Loosen up a little bit. Just like this.
 That's amazing, damn it!
 Loosen up, all right?
 Hey, you're a decent guy.
 I still can't float...
 Okay!
 What are you doing?
 Oh, I'm... um...
 I told you. There's no need for royalty  to take the same exam as the peasants.
 But...
 Your destination has already been decided.
 Do not take unnecessary action.
 Yes, Brother Nozel.
 Your existence itself is unnecessary.
 Magical Ability Exam
 Bah-ha!
 It's okay. Just relax!
 Bah-ha!
 Magical Ability Control Exam
 Don't worry about it. Just do your best.
 Creation Magic Exam
 Bah-ha!
 I'm not done yet!
 Next, next...
 Developmental Magic Exam
 Bah-ha!
 Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
 All right. The next exam  shall be the last one.
 You will engage in actual combat.
 You'll be battling!
 You will pair off and fight with your partner. You may use your grimoires to attack.
 If we lose, it'll severely  affect our evaluations.
 Picking the right opponent will be key.
 Fighting is our duty. Show us your true abilities!
 As soon as one of you yields or becomes  unable to fight, the exam will be over.
 There will be mages who can use  healing magic on standby.
 So fight to your heart's content!
 C-Crap! All I've been doing so far is yelling.
 I have to stand out by fighting  someone who looks strong.
 Come on... I need to find  someone to fight me.
 Bah-ha! Fight me, Asta.
 Sekke! You're willing to  fight a loser like me?
 But of course! Bah-ha!
 You're such a great guy!
 First combatants, come forward.
 Yes, sir!
 Bah-ha!
 Let's both give it our all and fight fair,  so we can achieve our goals!
 You don't have to try so hard anymore,
 you filthy little rat that  wandered into the wrong place.
 Thank you for making me  look even better so far.
 I'll get into the Magic Knights and  do my best for the both of us,
 and have a great time.
 Got it, you miserable peasant?
 Hurry back to your village in the boonies
 and continue enjoying your crappy little life.
 Bah-ha!
 Sekke chose the weakest-looking guy.
 Sekke...
 Begin!
 No holding back, all right?
 Let's do this, Asta! Bah-ha!
 Bronze Creation Magic:  Sekke Magnum Cannonball!
 How do you like my magic?
 It's bronzified and protects me as it shoots out magical bullets.
 It's offense and defense all in one!
 It'll block all of your lame attacks,  which will show off my defensive powers,
 and then I'll finish you off  once you've worn yourself out.
 That's pretty decent for an exam candidate.
 Doesn't he look like that spiky bug from the Mimo Amazon?
 There's no need to hold back. Come at me! Bah-ha!
 Now... Make sure you struggle as much  as you can to make things exciting!
 Sure thing.
 Here I go.
 Huh?
 Huh?
 Huh?
 Huh?
 I'm not joining
 the Magic Knights so I can have a good time and avoid working hard.
 I'm here to work my butt off  and become the Wizard King!
 No one can escape from here

 There's no way some kid from the  boonies can break through that.
 Man, I wish I was fighting that kid.
 What's the deal with that shabby grimoire?
 Can he even use magic?
 Stupid hick peasant.
 You're never going to make it  into any of the squads, kid!
 There's no need to hold back. Come at me! Bah-ha!
 Now... Make sure you struggle as much  as you can to make things exciting!
 Sure thing.

 He's fast. Is he using some kind of  high-speed movement magic?
 No... He's just physically powerful.
 Huh?
 Huh?

 I'm not joining

 I'm here to work my butt off  and become the Wizard King!

 Asta!
 Is that sword... magic?
 Wasn't he just some loser from the boonies?
 What the heck?
 Who is he?
 He just...
 ...said something about the Wizard King.
 All of you shut up! I told you, I'm going to become the Wizard King!
 You got a problem with that?!
 Is he stupid?
 What the heck is that peasant  from the boonies saying?
 Must be embarrassing,
 being a completely delusional idiot.
 Just get outta here already, you stupid brat!
 Who're you calling a stupid brat?!
 Could it be some kind of creation magic?
 Amazing...
 Judging from the other parts of the exam,
 it didn't seem like he had  that much magical power.
 He's not using magic.
 Huh?
 Actually, maybe it's not  that he's not using magic...
 It's that he doesn't have any magical power.
 Come to think of it, I didn't  sense any mana from him.
 And yet, he wants to become  the Wizard King, huh?
 Looks like we've got a  strange one on our hands.
 Bah... ha...
 Man, royalty's so strong.
 They have way too much magical  power and talent to begin with.
 S-S-S...
 S-So cool!
 On second thought, maybe the shrimp really is just a small-time lame-o.
 No kidding. His opponent must've  just let his guard down too much.
 ""Yuno,"" wasn't it?
 You seem to be having a hard  time finding an opponent.
 Why don't you pair up with me?
 Isn't that...
 Salim?
 From the famous Hapshass family?
 You may have been chosen by the  four-leaf, but you are no noble.
 I'll show you just how far below us nobles you are, both in status and power.
 Oh, and of course, in wealth, too.
 Begin!
 You should know that it's an  honor just to be able to fight
 the great Salim de Hapshass.
 You can tell the tale for the rest of your  life when you go back to your village.
 I'll at least treat you to a noble's ultimate attack:
 The Holy Lightning Rising Salim.
 Yuno...
 I'll even pay for your trip back home.
 Wind Magic: Towering Tornado.
 Salim, a noble, was defeated in an instant!
 Y-You can't be serious!
 That was awesome!
 Oh?
 Amazing. I want to be his friend, too.
 Wow, not bad.
 Yeah.
 This concludes the exam.
 Now...
 Candidates whose numbers are  called, please step forward.
 The squad captains will raise their  hands if they would like you
 to join their squads.
 The candidates will decide if  they would like to accept or decline,
 and if they are chosen  by more than one captain,
 they may choose which  squad they'd like to join.
 But if no one raises their hands,
 that candidate will not  join the Magic Knights.
 And you will leave immediately.
 Candidate #1, step forward.
 Y-Yes, sir!
 Number 32, no offers.
 Number 40, no offers.
 Number 45, no offers.
 Number 67, no offers.
 Wow, someone finally raised their hand.
 Awesome.
 Number 71, the Purple Orcas.
 Number 78.
 I shall welcome him.
 The Crimson Lion Kings.
 Number 99, the Coral Peacocks.
 Number 116,
 no offers.
 Damn it!
 Number 141...
 No offers.
 Well, I guess I expected that.
 I'll just go back to my  village and till my fields.
 Scary...
 Next, #164.
 Yes, sir.
 Yuno!
 All who wish to offer, please raise your hand.
 What?
 Seriously?
 All of the captains...
 ...raised their hands?!
 Th-That's amazing.
 I-I thought that only royalty and  nobles could join the Golden Dawn.
 Even the Silver Eagles? Seriously?
 But he's a kid from the boonies!
 All of them! That's amazing!
 N-Nothing less from my rival!
 I'll take the best path to  becoming the Wizard King.
 Please allow me to join the Golden Dawn.
 They took a good one.
 But I wanted to be his friend...
 Oh, well. Can't be helped.
 Next, #165.
 Oh. I guess that kid's next.
 I can't let Yuno get ahead of me!
 I'm ready!
 All who wish to offer, please raise your hand.
 I don't care which squad it is...  Someone, please raise your hand!
 Number 165...
 No offers.
 N-No way...
 Go on, scram! I'm up next!
 Not yet... I'm not done yet!
 You're a disgrace!
 No... I... I'm...
 Well, that's no surprise.
 Yami?
 No matter how high your combat skills are,
 if the source of your power is unknown,  no one wants anything to do with it.
 In the end, the only thing  desired from a Magic Knight
 is their magical powers.
 Wh-What's going on?
 Hey, Yami?!
 S-So much pressure!
 This is...
 the magical power of a  Magic Knights Squad captain?
 And since you have no magical powers,  no one wants you.
 That's the cruel reality.
 You said earlier that you wanted to  become the Wizard King, didn't you?
 Which means you're going to surpass  the nine captains here, right?
 Now that I'm standing before you, do you still have the nerve
 to say that you're going to be the Wizard King,
 even without any magical powers?
 E-Even if I can't join the Magic Knights today...
 No matter how many times I fall,
 no matter what anyone says to me,
 I'm still going to become  the Wizard King someday!
 You're funny, kid.
 Join my squad.
 Huh?
 I'm telling you that I'll let  you join the Black Bulls.
 By the way, declining isn't an option.
 What?!
 I'll make life so miserable for you in the Black Bulls that you'll be torn to shreds,
 so be ready for that.
 What?!
 And then, someday,
 become the Wizard King.
 Yes, sir!
 Number 512, no offers.
 This concludes the Magic  Knights Entrance Exam.
 Good work!
 Don't worry about it.
 Try again next year!
 Asta...
 Yuno! You're Golden! I'm a Bull!
 This is where our true battle begins!
 Yeah. Let's see who'll—
 N-Nature's calling pretty loud!
 Was it the grilled purple snake  I ate to psyche myself up?!
 It's coming! It's ready  to stick its head out!
 After humiliating me in front of everyone,
 don't think I'm just going  to let you leave, Asta.
 Because of you, I was only offered a  position in one of the lower ranking squads,
 the Green Praying Mantises!
 I'm a frickin' bug!
 You're just a hick from the boonies. You think you can become the Wizard King?
 Life ain't that simple.
 Bronze Hex Magic: Sekke's Poison Lizard.
 I'll test your luck for you.
 Eat lizard poison!
 If your luck's bad, you'll be  bedridden for life. Bah-ha!
 Huh?
 What are you doing?
 Four-leaf...
 B-Bah-ha! I was just going to give him a  little scare. You know, as a parting gift.
 T-To see who'll make it  further in this world.
 Then get lost.
 You're no match for Asta.
 Oh, I just remembered! I have somewhere to be.
 Tell Asta bye for me. Bah-ha!
 That feels so much better.
 Man... It all came right out.  I have no regrets or poop left in me.
 All right.
 Let's go.
 You've got some nerve, making me wait.
 How long does it take you to take a dump?
 Actually, it was really something!
 It was long and huge...
 That's not what I meant!
 Who asked you to start talking  about your turds, you moron?!
 Let's go, Finral.
 Right-o.
 What's that?
 Since you can't magically fly,
 you're going to have to learn  some transport magic, too.
 Oh, wait. You don't have any magical powers!
 Ow! What the heck?!
 Er, sorry to bug you, Yami, but it's a  bit hard to keep a gate this size open,
 so could you just go through quickly?
 Who do you think you're ordering around?
 Tough it out, and surpass your limits.
 What?!
 Off you go.
 So tired...
 Ow...
 Black Bulls' Base
 This is the Black Bulls'...
 Well? Pretty magnificent, isn't it?
 It's actually pretty run-down.
 Welcome to the Black Bulls.
 Starting today, I'm also going to be...
 All right!
 I'm Asta from Hage Village!  I'll be joining the Black Bulls tod—
 Oh, dear...
 Welcome to the absolute worst Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls.
 No one can escape from here
 Once again in the small closed off classroom
 The star of the class was shining yet again
 They shine so bright that I close my eyes
 I've thought many times
 That the revolution was within my hands
 Isn't it strange? If you want  to laugh, go ahead and laugh
 The rest of us who were left  behind wanted to become something
 We repeat the same morning over and over
 You're the only one who  can choose your tomorrow

 Your Holy Lightning Rising Salim isn't so bad, either. Bah-ha!
 Sekke, I believe we could  be the best of friends.
 Bah-ha!
 Not a chance...
 We did it!
 We're finally the Magic Knights we always hoped to be!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Magic Knights Entrance Exam.
 Asta and Yuno were able to get through  its grueling selection process.
 Wind Magic: Towering Tornado.

 Seriously?
 All of the captains...

 Please allow me to join the Golden Dawn.

 You're funny, kid.
 Join my squad.
 Both Asta and Yuno successfully joined
 the Magic Knights and took their first  steps toward becoming the Wizard King.
 I'm Asta from Hage Village! I'll be joining the Black Bulls tod—
 Oh, dear...
 Welcome to the absolute worst Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls.
 The Black Bulls
 Grey words can't make anything happen
 I know, yeah I know
 Wishing to fly freely across the sky
 I dreamed it all my life
 Step by step I go, though  it's a doubtful world 
 Don't care how much I fall
 Instinct is my guide, I never give up
 To faraway future, I burst out running
 Go beyond even the unseen fears
 The vision I had, so I can be myself
 Someday I will write the next page
 You are my hope
 Like that page from someday
 I was able to meet you
 I call this a miracle
 So you're our new member this year?
 What's your name?
 It's Yuno.
 Hmph.
 I'm Klaus Lunettes.
 You're neither a royal nor a noble,
 but a peasant from the boonies,  and he let you join our squad.
 What in the world is Captain  Vangeance thinking?
 Don't get a big head just because  all the captains raised their hands
 for you at the exam.
 You won't be accepted as a member  of the Golden Dawn that easily.
 I'll see to it that you accept me soon.
 That's some mouth you have.
 I'm not done yet!
 Now I'm pissed! You'd better be prepared!
 I'm not... but let's do this!
 Die!
 Whee!
 What's all the ruckus?
 Ugh, I drank way too much. My head hurts.
 You're as adorable as an angel again today, my little sister Marie.
 Keep it down, you morons!
 I see they're at it again.
 They're at it again.
 Hey, that's dangerous!
 They're scary...
 B-But starting today, I'm also  a member of the Black Bulls.
 I'm Asta from Hage Village! It's a pleasure to meet all of you!
 I'm gonna be the Wizard King!
 That pudding you were  saving sure was delicious.
 That's going to be your last supper!
 That's enough, you two!
 What if this ruckus you curs are causing  wakes up my little sister, you dumbasses?!
 Oh, shut up, sister lover!
 I remember up to when I started a  drinking contest with some old guy.
 Thanks!
 They're not listening at all!
 This is for my pudding!
 Would you guys shut up? You're not helping my headache!
 Shut up, you booze-swilling hussy!
 What'd you call me?!
 You virgin delinquent!
 Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Who're you  calling a virgin delinquent?!
 Uh-oh! If you look away,  I'm going to kill you.
 Just try and kill me!
 I told you guys to shut up!
 In the name of my angelic sister,  Marie, I will kill you all!
 All of you...
 Stop breaking everything!
 Yet he just destroyed the wall!
 Captain!
 Thanks for all your hard work, Mister Yami!
 Captain, this is really good. I'll give you half. I'm giving you half!
 Do you have a moment, Captain?
 Welcome back, Captain! Come on.  Have a seat and drink with me.
 Mister Yami, did anyone get too uppity  with you? If they did, I'll kill them!
 Captain! Spar with me today!
 Come on! With everything you've got!
 C'mon, just ignore these  brats and drink with me.
 Hey, hey, eat this.
 Isn't it delicious? Isn't it?
 I'm sorry. I've reached my limit,  so can I go see my sister now?
 I see, I see. So you guys  love me that much, eh?
 But you need to shut up.
 Sorry.
 I brought a new mem—
 Where'd he go?
 Over there.
 Save me!
 Why are you fooling around over there?
 I-I'm not.
 This little shrimp is our other new member.
 Other?
 What was your name again?
 Right!
 I'm Asta from Hage Village!
 It's nice to meet all of you!
 Hage? Seriously?
 Talk about out in the sticks.
 Hey, introduce him to the other members.
 Oh, right. Well, you've already met him, but...
 This is Gordon Agrippa.
 Nice to meet you.
 He's pretty gloomy, and you never know  what he's thinking, but he's a good guy.
 And over here
 is Vanessa Enoteca.
 She'll get in your face when she's drunk, but she's a good person.
 I won't get in anyone's face.
 Hage... Isn't that a small  village out in the boonies?
 Yes!
 Huh...
 To come from out in the boonies and join the Magic Knights...
 You must've worked really hard, little boy.
 How about I reward you with a special treat?
 I wish I could accept that!
 But I already have a goddess  named Sister Lily in my heart!
 Let's continue with the introductions.
 What?!
 I'm next!
 This is Luck Voltia.
 He loves to fight and is obsessed  with battle, but he's a good guy.
 Nice to meet ya!
 Do you like to fight?
 S-Sure...
 I love to fight!
 Wanna fight? Wanna fight?
 Huh? What?
 Hey.
 Look.
 Huh?
 This is my little sister Marie. She's an angel.
 Right...
 Listen well. If you lay a finger  on Marie, I'll kill you.
 What?!
 This is Gauche Adlai.
 He's a bit too obsessed with his  little sister, but he's a good guy.
 This is Charmy Pappitson. She eats way  too much, but she's a good person.
 Nice to meet you!
 This is Grey. I don't really  get him, but he's a good guy.
 H-Hi...
 And then we have Magna Swing. He's a delinquent, but he's a good guy.
 He's scary!
 And I'm Finral Roulacase. I'm super popular.
 And last but not least,  the captain of the Black Bulls,
 Yami Sukehiro!
 He's not calling him a good guy?!
 Th-Thank you for having me!
 There are other members, but they're either on some mission,
 taking a break, or slacking off.
 Try to get along with them all.
 Right! I'll super get along with them all!
 Once again, it's nice to meet all of you!
 My head hurts.
 Your height and the volume of your voice are all out of proportion.
 Yes, sir!
 Shut up.
 Sorry!
 Anyway, put him to work, but don't kill him.
 Huh?!
 Did you hear that?
 What?
 Mister Yami said to put you to work.
 I'll gladly put you to work.
 A weak-looking shrimp like you from  a village like Hage out in the boonies...
 I barely sense any mana from you.
 And you're a new member of the Black Bulls?
 I don't know what a hick like  you with no magical powers
 did to get on Mister Yami's good side, but...
 You want one of these Black Bulls robes?
 A-A Magic Knight robe! S-So cool!
 Isn't it?
 You want one?
 I do!
 Please give me one!
 Oh, yeah? You want it that badly, huh?
 In that case...
 You're going to have to convince me,  Mister Yami's #1 man
 and a real man's man, Magna Swing!
 Time for your initiation  into the Black Bulls.
 Huh?
 His face is so scary.
 Hey, hick from Hage!
 If you want one of these robes, get through this trial I'm about to give you.
 Got it!
 He's making up initiation rituals again.
 I wanna do it, too!
 You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!
 Marie...
 Let's start this thing!
 First, show me just how much  guts and stamina you have!
 Five thousand sit-ups!
 Got it!
 Five thousand push-ups!
 Ow!
 Not yet! I'm not done yet!
 Ow!
 You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!
 My angel...
 That kid's not bad, though this is pointless.
 Not that it matters since magic  is everything in this world,
 but he has a crazy amount of energy.
 How's that?!
 I guess you have some guts.
 Did I convince you?
 Can I have my robe now?
 Not yet!
 You're a hick from the boonies!  It's not gonna be that easy!
 There's one more.  The final trial in the initiation!
 The final...
 You can use magic or whatever else you want...
 to either block or dodge my attack magic!
 If you're able to do that, you'll officially be one of us Black Bulls.
 You'll get your precious robe!
 Want...
 G-Got it! I'll do my best!
 Shut up!
 Hold up your grimoire, you stupid shrimp!
 Yes, sir!
 Whoa! What's that?
 It's huge.
 You ready?
 Yup!
 Here I go!
 Bring it on, sir!
 Not bad!
 Yes, sir!
 I might just make it.
 But the true test...
 starts now!
 It's so hot.
 Flame Magic:
 Exploding... Fireball!
 Die!
 Seriously?!
 Oh. I'm dead.
 Asta's brain knew instinctively.
 With his well-trained muscles, kinetic vision, and explosive power,
 Asta had always been able to slice  through magic and defeat his enemies.
 But Magna's magic was  too fast for Asta to see.
 It's fast!
 Even if he could slice through it,
 the momentum of this attack would continue.
 He would just be hit by  the split attack's halves.
 I can't stop it!
 Now that he had realized his limits, his brain shut down.
 However...
 His body hadn't given up!
 His well-trained body's super reflexes
 put up one last struggle...
 And he was able to find a way out!
 He hit it! He hit it!
 Wow.
 It's been a while since we didn't  have to save a new recruit's hide.
 He wasn't able to cut it,  but he was able to hit it.
 That sword can cut through  magic as well as repel it.
 How interesting.
 I had no idea!
 I knew it could cut through magic, but I guess I can hit it, too.
 This sword is awesome! But man,  I thought I was gonna die!
 That was too close!
 What's he thinking?! Was he  planning to kill a new recruit?!
 Wait, is he dead?
 You little bastard.
 What?! He took that head-on, and he's fine?!
 I was able to nullify it in time, so I'm fine,
 but I was almost offed by my own magic.
 You little bastard!
 Scary! Scary! Scary! Scary!
 You're not half bad!
 Huh? What?!
 Not only were you able to block my magic,  you actually sent it right back at me!
 I like you, Shrimpsta!
 I-It's Asta!
 Sorry I made fun of you for being a  backwoods hick with little magical power.
 I'm actually from out in the country myself.
 I'm from Rayaka Village, just above Hage.
 Whoa, seriously? Rayaka Village is way out in the sticks!
 Like you can talk!
 Actually, it's not that I have little  magical power. I don't have any at all.
 Huh?
 You don't have any magical power?
 And yet you were able to  hit my attack back at me?
 Y-Yeah...
 That's even more awesome! So that means
 you're a real man.
 Nice! You're really interesting!
 Want to eat this?
 Not bad, little boy.
 Stay away from my sister.
 All right. Let's start the second initiation!
 Come again?
 Let's try and kill each other!
 You looked great out there, little boy.
 Uh, thanks...
 Here.
 Try it. It's yummy. Okay?
 Oh, thanks.
 Here! I'm being generous. You can have half!
 Actually, half of half.
 Thanks!
 Yummy!
 Okay, okay. Isn't there something  more important you should be doing?
 Aw...
 Here.
 This is yours, Asta!
 You don't want it?
 I do! I do!
 This is mine...
 Go ahead, try it on.
 And while we're at it...
 Looks good on you. Don't you think so, Mister Yami?
 He looks pretty bland.
 And now, you're officially a member of  the Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls!
 You better work hard not to shame  Mister Yami or the Black Bulls!
 Thanks! It's a pleasure  to work with all of you!
 Shut up.
 Sorry!
 I'll be more careful next time!

 This is your room.
 Huh?
 Well? Isn't it depressing  how small and filthy it is?
 By the way, my room is twice as big—
 My own room!
 He's actually moved?!
 I-I've never had my own room!
 At the church, we all shared a room, so we'd sleep lined up next to each other.
 Hi-yah!
 I'm gonna get you so clean!
 Until you're all sparkly and shiny!
 Better get scrubbin'.
 You're free to do whatever  until we get a mission.
 Oh, by the way, Asta.
 Yeah?
 Make sure you write letters.
 Huh?
 To everyone at that church of yours.
 They're your family, right? I'm sure they're  worried about how things turned out.
 Right!
 Don't make anyone worry about you.
 That's how to be a real man. See ya!
 If you need anything, come see me.
 Right! Thanks!
 This is my first castle.
 I'm going to climb my way up  to Wizard King from here.
 I'm not going to lose. Got it, Yuno?
 How unfortunate.
 This room is wasted on you.
 Tomorrow, I'll be lecturing you  on your duties as a Magic Knight.
 I'd rather not be your instructor,
 but the captain ordered me to do so,  and as such, I have no choice.
 Are you listening?
 It's Yuno.
 I have a name, and it's Yuno, Klaus.
 I'm your senior.
 You'll address me with respect.
 Understood.
 Don't be late.
 Oh?
 Well done, Yuno!
 He made it into the Magic Knights!  He's truly our pride!
 Yuno's so cool!
 So cool!
 I have to let the whole village know!
 So, Sister, what does the  letter from Asta say?
 Man, his handwriting sucks.  When's he coming home?
 We'll have to cheer him up  when he comes back.
 I'm sure even Asta would  be depressed about that.
 We'll have a super tato party.
 He says he passed.
 Huh?
 Asta passed, too.
 What?!
 Seriously?!
 Wow... He really passed.
 Th-Then I guess he won't be coming home.
 I see... So they both passed.
 All right, I'm going to tell the whole village!
 This is the first bit of good news we've gotten since Hage Village was founded!
 Yeah!
 I see. So Asta passed, too... I see.
 Asta, Yuno, congratulations.
 Keep doing your best.
 It wasn't a dream!
 All right! Let's do thi—
 Ow...
 Was this pillar here yesterday?
 Hey, newbie. Did you sleep well?
 Ah, g-good morning! Um, sir, about this pillar...
 What about it?
 I don't think it was here yesterday.
 Don't worry about a pillar. The base  itself changes its shape all the time.
 Wh-What?!
 Don't worry. You'll get used to it.
 Really?
 All right, let's go.
 Okay!
 You're in for a treat.
 I'll personally show you around  the Black Bulls' super cool base!

 You don't need the ""moron"" part!

 What do you think? It's stupidly huge!
 Yeah! It's really big!
 This is the bath.
 It's hot!
 This kind of heat is nothing to  a member of the Black Bulls!
 What? You're getting out already?
 N-No, not yet! I'm not done yet!
 It's hot. I want to add cold water.  Hanging out naked is nice, though.
 Over there are all the girls' rooms.
 If any of us guys go in, you'll be killed by trap magic.
 What?!
 And this is... the toilet!
 I'll kill you.
 Sorry!
 This is the beasts' room!
 Wh-Why?!
 This is Mister Yami's hobby.
 Asta!
 Y-Yes?
 I'll let you have the duty of  taking care of all the animals.
 Huh?
 It's a very honorable role. I really don't  want to let you have it, but I will.
 Feed 'em twice a day, in the morning and at night.
 Go on, give it a try.
 R-Right...
 There, there... Here, eat.
 This is the library.
 Right!
 This is the playroom. You can have plenty of fun here.
 H-Huh?!
 Come on! Try to keep up!
 Wait up!
 I'm not gonna lose!
 Ow!
 Magna?
 A Black Bulls robe. Which means...
 Hey, Asta. That's your colleague.
 She's the other new recruit this year!
 Huh? My colleague?
 I love the sound of that!
 Hey! I'm Asta, from Hage Village!
 Let's do our best together!  It's nice to meet you!
 I didn't give you permission to speak to me.
 I barely sense any mana  from you, you lowly insect.
 Insect?!
 Lowly?!
 My name is Noelle Silva. I belong  to the royal family of this kingdom.
 What?!
 R-R-R-Royal family?!
 I do beg your pardon.
 I'm but a puny insect that someone  could blow away just by breathing.
 As long as you understand.
 Wait.
 Who're you calling an insect, huh?!
 We're supposed to be  colleagues as Magic Knights!
 Who cares if you're royalty?!
 That's right, Asta! You tell her! Status means nothing!
 Of course it does.
 How do you figure?!
 Are foolish peasants unable to  understand this with words alone?
 I guess I'll have to show you with the  difference between our magical powers.
 H-Hey!
 Know your place.
 I won't make it in ti—
 What?!
 You little bitch!
 You've got some nerve! What do you  think you're doing to your senior?!
 You were just standing in the wrong spot.
 Who gave you permission to stand there?
 What?!
 Why, you little...
 I'm your senior!
 And I'm royalty!
 What?!
 I don't care if you're royalty or the  Silver Eagles' captain's little sister!
 Huh?
 I mean, the only person who'd accept  a spoiled brat like you is Mister Yami!
 Be more thankful, you moron!
 I held back because you're a girl, but now  I'm gonna have to initiate you, too, damn it!
 Like I want to be in this pathetic squad.
 You little...
 Hey! What the hell do  you think you're doing?!
 Who cares about the Black Bulls? I don't need that filthy thing.
 This is the absolute  worst Magic Knights Squad,
 and it's not where royalty  like myself belongs!
 You bastard! Apologize to  the robe and Mister Yami!
 Apologize! Apologize! Apologize,  damn it! You moron!
 The robe I worked so hard  to get... She just...
 What the heck was her problem?
 I couldn't find the toilet  and ended up outside.
 Wha...
 What? What? What?!
 Noelle...
 Why?
 Why won't it go the way...
 I want it to?!
 I guess I'm just...
 Apparently, the youngest of the Silva family  can't even control her magical powers.
 Who would have thought someone like that  would be born into the royal family?
 What's with that flimsy little grimoire?
 Are you really royalty?
 It's just pathetic that you can't  even control your powers.
 It disgusts me that you're my little sister.
 I will not have someone as shameful  as you in the Silver Eagles.
 Why couldn't you have died  instead of our mother?
 You're a complete failure.
 I'm not a failure! I'll make them acknowledge me!
 I guess she's got it rough, too.
 Hey!
 Insect?
 H-How long have you...
 I'm going to be mocked again...
 I...
 I will not have someone as shameful  as you in the Silver Eagles.
 It's just pathetic that you can't  even control your powers.
 Are you really royalty?
 N...
 N?
 No!
 All done taking a dump. Guess I'll go back to bed now.
 What the heck is that?
 Oh, dear...
 Wow.
 This is insane.
 Someone's magic is out of control.
 Such immense magical power...
 This is gonna get bad if  we don't do something.
 If we attack it with magic,  she might not make it out alive.
 Could you use your spatial magic to scoop just her up?
 Please don't be ridiculous.  I can't get near that.
 Right. If only we had someone who  could nullify magical powers...
 Oh, no!
 You came flying by at the perfect time.
 Huh?
 Could you go take care of that?
 Take care of that?!
 Okay!
 Wait. How am I supposed to get  over there, though? I can't fly...
 Quit yer yapping.
 Now is the time when you need  to go beyond your limits!
 I'm done for!
 All right! I'm alive!
 That was so much fun, wasn't it?
 Jeez. Now I'm all wet.
 Thanks for that spatial magic!
 You're welcome!
 Well done, brat.
 Right!
 Hey, you!
 You failure...
 They're going to mock me again.
 You...
 ...have some insane magical powers! That's so awesome!
 Huh?
 I don't have any magical powers,  so I'm jealous, damn it!
 If you train so you can learn to control them,
 you'll be invincible, Noelle!
 Insec—
 Asta...
 I'm gonna keep doing my  best so I won't lose, either!
 Really? You just couldn't  control your magical powers?
 You should've told me earlier,  you royal failure.
 We're the Black Bulls. We're a whole group of failures!
 No one cares if you have  a flaw or two, you idiot.
 Anyway, thank goodness you're safe.
 By the way, I know a great pasta place. Want to go sometime?
 Before that, you should try this. 'Kay?
 That was amazing.
 If anything, the one thing I'm great  at is controlling magical powers,
 so I'll help you out.
 I'll show you some womanly techniques, too.
 I'll tell you how much of an  angel my little sister Marie is.
 Let's start out as friends.
 Here.
 Let's do our best together.
 It's a pleasure to work with you.
 No one can escape from here
 Once again in the small closed off classroom
 The star of the class was shining yet again
 They shine so bright that I close my eyes
 I've thought many times
 That the revolution was within my hands
 Isn't it strange? If you want  to laugh, go ahead and laugh
 The rest of us who were left  behind wanted to become something
 We repeat the same morning over and over
 You're the only one who  can choose your tomorrow

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Go! Go! First Mission
 Grey words can't make anything happen
 I know, yeah I know
 Wishing to fly freely across the sky
 I dreamed it all my life
 Step by step I go, though  it's a doubtful world 
 Don't care how much I fall
 Instinct is my guide, I never give up
 To faraway future, I burst out running
 Go beyond even the unseen fears
 The vision I had, so I can be myself
 Someday I will write the next page
 You are my hope
 Like that page from someday
 I was able to meet you
 I call this a miracle
 Mornings start early for Magic Knights.
 There are many things they must do.
 Cleaning.
 Laundry.
 But my heart belongs to Sister Lily.
 Next!
 The Beasts' Room
 Taking care of the beasts.
 Sit!
 There, there. Good boy.
 Here.
 You must endure, even if you're  almost eaten by a beast. And...
 In Front of the Captain's Room
 Captain Yami...
 Captain...
 You must wake up the captain of  the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.
 Captain! It's morning!
 Don't wake me up! I'll kill you!
 Sorry about that!
 Even though you're the one who told me  to wake you up every morning!
 Magic Knights must also deal with  unreasonable demands.
 Man, I've been working hard   since the crack of dawn again.
 Magic Knights sure have a lot of work to do.
 Wait, how is this any different from  what I was doing at the church?!
 What are Magic Knights  supposed to do anyway?!
 Cafeteria
 There's nothing but meat for breakfast.
 Noelle, why don't you help me  with the cleaning and stuff?
 Cleaning? But I'm royalty.
 But you're a newbie just like me!
 I've never cleaned or  done laundry in my life.
 That's not something to brag about, is it?
 We're in the same squad, aren't we?
 I'm pretty sure you should  be helping with that stuff.
 But I'm royalty.
 Why are you talking to me like that?
 Shut up, you insect.
 Damn it!
 So, uh...
 What do Magic Knights do anyway?
 What? Are you seriously asking that?
 We protect the kingdom and handle security!
 It's the most manly job  in the world, you dumbass!
 Why'd you decide to join  when you knew nothing about it?
 I'm sorry!
 I'm going to become the Wizard King.
 I'm going to barf everything back up!
 They sure are lively first  thing in the morning.
 Being energetic is the best.  Can I have some of that energy?
 Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...
 Damn it. Show 'em what Magic Knights do,
 you drunk witch.
 Well...
 We keep the citizens safe? Something like that.
 You might even be able to get closer to some  noble when you're assigned to protect them.
 I see!
 It's a super-fun job where you get  to fight with enemies all you want.
 If they're criminals, you can beat them up all you want and not get in trouble!
 Most importantly, it's a wonderful job  that my sister respects me for having.
 Isn't she an angel? I can buy her  whatever she wants with my pay.
 But if you lay a finger  on Marie, I'll kill you.
 Wh-What about you, Finral?
 It's the best job in the world,  since I get to save girls and be popular.
 Of course I'll tell you.  We're friends, after all.
 Charmy?
 I'm... out of food!
 I'm nowhere near full.
 Cotton Creation Magic: Sheep Cooks!
 Thank you for the food!
 As long as you're a Magic Knight,  you can eat plenty of food!
 Munchy...
 Uh, Grey?
 Huh?!
 Well, basically, it's a good job.
 He looks just like you.
 I'm looking forward to working  with you on a mission.
 R-Right...
 Th-They're all weirdos.
 Should I really be in this squad?
 If you take this and this, and put them  together and do this, it's really yummy.
 Try a bite? 'Kay?
 No, I'm full, thanks.
 Well? Do you understand  what Magic Knights do now?
 Not at all!
 Let's go, Magna.
 Yes, sir, Mister Yami!
 What's going on? What's going on?
 There's a mission.
 A Magic Knights' mission?
 C-Can I come with—
 No!
 We can't bring any kids along.
 This is a very important mission for adults.
 All right. We're off.
 Hey! Don't break everything while we're gone.
 Okay! Have fun!
 Captain! Will you fight me  when you come back?
 Come back soon. I'll be waiting.
 Come back by dinner! Munchy...
 Can I go see Marie soon?
 I'm having withdrawal symptoms.
 Maybe I'll go flirt...
 I mean, go on a mission, too.
 Should I really be in this squad?
 Captain Yami and Magna  both looked so serious.
 What kind of mission could it be?
 This is bad...
 This is really bad!
 And now you're both...
 finished!
 And now you're both...
 finished!
 Flush!
 Two pair.
 I've got nothing!
 You got me!
 This feels great!
 Damn it! That's six months worth of pay.
 You've still got a ways to go,  Magna. You, too, Captain!
 Good! Very good!
 Now I can buy some great gifts for  everyone in the village on my way home.
 Let's go another round.
 Mister Yami?
 Oh? But you don't have  anything else to bet, do you?
 You don't have any clothes or cash.
 Yeah! We're basically naked!
 No, there's still more.
 Hey, gramps.
 Let's do one last round.  If we win, we get everything back.
 Oh, and if you lose?
 This!
 M-Mister Yami! That's...
 So let's do another round!
 Er, you probably shouldn't be betting that.
 Yeah, Mister Yami!
 Shut up!
 Use this moment to go beyond your limits!
 But you know...
 All right. If you lose,  how about you do anything I ask?
 Anything?
 Anything? Of course Mister Yami would never accept...
 I accept.
 Mister Yami accepted! I'm in!
 Old Man Seihi, say your prayers!
 I wonder who'll be saying their prayers...
 This could work!
 Shoot!
 There, there. Good boy.
 Here.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Hey! Don't just stand there! Help me!
 I'm royalty.
 You should be thankful that  I even got out of bed.
 How?! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 I thought I was going to die.
 You really are freakishly strong.
 Well, I train!
 Captain Yami and Magna...
 I wonder if they finished their... mission?!
 What?
 That old man actually had  a royal straight flush!
 Who would've thought? He's amazing!
 We're no match for Old Man Seihi!
 People sure are strong when they  have something on the line.
 Hey, Stupidsta, Lady Noe, we're back!
 Be happy! You two are going on  your first mission
 as Magic Knights.
 Huh?
 And so, we're giving you your first mission.
 Our first mission...
 ...as Magic Knights.
 Wh-What is it?
 It had better be something  worthy of me as a royal.
 Yeah, you should be honored.
 You'll be hunting wild boars  in Saussy Village!
 Wild...
 ...boars?
 Boar!
 Wh-What in the world is this lame mission?
 What are you calling lame?!
 I can beat a wild boar with my bare hands!
 Don't you dare underestimate wild boars!
 They come charging outta nowhere!
 Haven't you ever heard  the phrase ""rushing into things""?!
 We both ended up losing to  the mayor of Saussy Village.
 Huh?
 C-Captain Yami and Magna lost?
 Just how strong is he?
 It was cards.
 Cards?!
 He basically stripped us of all we had.
 And six months worth of pay, too!
 Why...
 ...are you bragging?
 And we ended up promising him  we'd do anything if we lost,
 so he asked us to take care  of some wild boars for him.
 Apparently, a herd showed up near  the village, and they're ruining the fields.
 Well, I'll be waiting at my village.
 Oh, I'll at least return these to you.
 Hi, question! That has nothing  to do with us, right?
 Yeah! You two are the ones who lost! Then...
 You idiots! You're asking Mister Yami  to clean up his own mistakes?!
 Normally...
 ...you would.
 We're the ones who clean up  Mister Yami's mistakes!
 Are you going to go, or are you going to die?
 Which will it be?
 We'll go!
 Even though we're hunting wild boars,  this is our first mission as Magic Knights.
 I'm so excited!
 I'm supposed to get rid of wild boars?
 What? You're still complaining?
 I'm not complaining, but...
 I was just wondering if I should go,  since I can't control my magical powers.
 You idiot!
 What...
 You'll be able to fix that in no time  with some missions under your belt!
 And...
 I'll be sure to clean up any of you  newbies' mistakes, since I'm your senior.
 Magna, you're such a manly man!
 Stop it, Stupidsta. You're making me blush.
 I-If you insist, I guess  I could accompany you.
 Thank you very much!
 Wait. Why are you always looking down on us?!
 I'm not. It's just that  you're always below me.
 What kind of reasoning is that?!
 So...
 Use your spatial magic to  get us to Saussy Village.
 Saussy Village?
 Not happening.
 What do you mean, you jerk?!
 Well, I can only go to  faraway places I can't see
 if I've marked them  with my magical powers.
 Huh?!
 Meaning I can't go to places  I've never been to before.
 You're so useless!
 Guess we don't have a choice.  We'll go by broomstick.
 Magna, sir!
 Yeah, Asta?
 I can't fly on a broomstick!
 Sir.
 Yes, Noelle?
 I can't, either.
 What?! Are you two serious?!
 Why can't you do something  so easy, you morons?!
 Damn it! That's as basic as it gets!
 Well, I don't have any magical powers!
 Why are you bragging about that?!
 Well, I can't control my magical powers,  so of course I can't. You fool.
 And why do you sound so high and mighty?!
 Guess I don't have a choice.
 I'll give you two a ride on my baby.
 Baby?
 Her name's...
 Crazy Cyclone!
 Crazy Cyclone
 S-So cool!
 I know, right?! Isn't she a beaut?
 Yeah, she is!
 Lame.
 What?! Are you not able to  comprehend her majestic form?
 So lame!
 Let's go!
 Are you going to be all right?
 A man never goes back on his word!
 Here we go!
 Fly!
 How do you like that?  Crazy Cyclone can even handle three riders!
 Hey! Fly a bit more steady!
 H-H-Hey! Don't get so close to me!
 You can't be serious,  you mohawked delinquent!
 Who are you calling a mohawked delinquent?!
 Yahoo!
 This is amazing, Magna!  We're one with the wind!
 And if you don't want to die,  get a little closer, Stupidsta!
 Yes, sir!
 Hey! Where are you touching me?!
 What the hell are you two doing?!
 Saussy Village
 Right on schedule.
 So this is where the magic stone is located.
 We're going to find it.

 Actually, is that even a wild boar?!
 Isn't it using some magic of its own?!
 It's super fast!
 Shouldn't we rescue him?
 I'm taking a break.
 My magical powers are pretty much  drained after flying you two this far.
 I'm sure he'll be fine. He's pretty tough.
 But...
 If you're so worried, you go save him.
 I can do this.
 Why me?!
 I've got you now!
 I finally got 'im.
 Great job, Asta.
 But it ain't over yet.
 What a haul!
 You're pretty amazing.
 Three or four wild boars ain't nothing.
 You've got some impressive brute strength.
 This should make Old Man Seihi happy.  Let's have ourselves a wild boar party.
 This mayor of Saussy Village...  Seihi? You know him?
 Yeah. I've known him for a long time.
 I'm from Rayaka Village,  which is just past here,
 but I used to be a bit of a  handful when I was a kid.
 Used to be?
 Like you aren't now?
 I got a big head after I got my grimoire
 and went into Saussy Village with  the intent of taking over, too.
 And then...
 Take that!
 Hey, you little brat! What do you think you're doing?!
 You wanna get hurt, old man?
 You're the one that's gonna get hurt!
 Take that!
 Time for your punishment!
 That's dangerous!
 And now...
 Wh-What the hell are you doing?
 Time for an ass whoopin'!
 Hey! Damn it!
 Since then, I've challenged  that old man many times.
 Real men don't make trouble for others!
 Take that!
 Help the weak and humble the strong.  That's what a true man does.
 Golden!
 Real men don't make others worry about them.
 He whooped my ass every time.
 He must be strong.
 I found this out later, but Old Man Seihi
 had enough magical power that he aspired  to be a Magic Knight when he was younger.
 He's the one who suggested that I  take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.
 Oh? Looks like you've improved a bit.
 W-Well, I'm getting the hang  of using my grimoire.
 In that case, why don't you try  taking the Magic Knights Entrance Exam?
 Huh?
 M-Me? Take the entrance exam?
 You've got skill.
 There's... no way that'll happen.  I'm a commoner from the boonies.
 Nothing's written in stone!
 What does being from the boonies or being  a commoner have to do with anything?
 It's up to you to take hold of your own future.
 I'm sure you'll be able to fulfill  the dream I couldn't.
 Old Man...
 Be a man, Magna.
 So what do Magic Knights do, anyway?
 You don't even know that?!
 It's all because of him that  I'm here right now.
 When I passed the Magic Knights Entrance Exam, he was happier for me than anyone.
 He must be a nice person.
 Yeah.
 And he went to the royal capital...
 well, to get rich quick so he could  make some money for his village,
 but I think he also came to see me.
 He did take me for every bit  of change I had, though!
 But he's the one who showed me  what a real man should be.
 I wanted to be like him, the person  I respect most after Mister Yami...
 Magna?
 The hell is that?!
 The village...
 It's covered in mist.
 Wow, the weather sucks in that town.
 You idiot! That's magic.
 What?!
 Saussy Village
 A magical mist?
 Once we enter it, we probably  won't be able to get anywhere.
 We'll lose our sense of direction and  end up wandering around in the mist.
 Magic that can cover a whole village...
 None of the villagers have magic this strong.
 Of course, this isn't Old  Man Seihi's magic, either.
 What's going on?
 Hey!
 Yes, sir?
 Cut through the mist with your sword.
 Sure thing!
 Huh?
 That's a dumb thing to say. You can't cut through mist with a sword.
 You're the dumb one!
 Since it's magic, you can cut  through it with your sword!
 Oh, yeah!
 Good. Now, let's go.
 Right!
 Take a right there.
 Got it!
 Take a left there.
 Right!
 You seem to know where you're going.
 Well, yeah. Left.
 Did you feel that?
 Yes. Powerful magic.
 Straight ahead. Be careful.

 Nick! What the heck's going on?

 Hey! Wake up!

 He tried to protect us.
 Grandpa, they came. The Magic Knights...
 Your prayers were answered.
 A person can just die... so easily?
 Are you the bastard who did this?!
 How dare you put me behind schedule?
 You'll all be executed in ten seconds.
 Crap! I'm short on magic!
 Asta!
 I won't forgive this!
 How could you do something so cruel?
 Who the heck are you guys?!
 They don't seem like spies  from the Diamond Kingdom
 or barbarians here to trash the village.
 Who are these guys?
 I don't recall hearing anything  about Magic Knights showing up.
 Could they be out on some unofficial mission?
 And how did they get into the village through our mist barrier?
 The Black Bulls...
 Crude heretics that don't fit in with  the rest of the Magic Knights.
 Dealing with them would be a waste of time.
 Five minutes...
 We'll get rid of the useless villagers  that didn't know anything
 and seek what we came here for.
 Don't ignore me!
 Mist Magic: Whirlpool of Illusory Mist.
 You're a fool to think you could  get near Lord Heath so easily.
 Damn you!
 Be lost in the mist.
 No, I won't!
 He cut through my ice magic earlier. I don't know what kind of magic he uses...
 But his sword negates magic.
 We shouldn't let him get too close.
 I'm asking you why you tried  to kill all these villagers!
 This world is split into several regions.
 Forsaken Realm
 Common Realm
 Noble Realm
 Diamond Kingdom
 Heart Kingdom
 Saussy
 Rayaka
 The Noble Realm where royalty lives, the Common Realm where the commoners live,
 Spade Kingdom
 and the Forsaken Realm.
 Huh?
 This village, Saussy, is located  in the Forsaken Realm.
 Most of those who inhabit  the Forsaken Realm are
 an inferior race that can only use  enough magic to complete daily tasks.
 They're basically mindless beasts.
 I was only trying to get  rid of the mindless beasts
 that might steal more of my precious time.
 Beasts?
 The three of you
 also had enough magical power to  join the Magic Knights, did you not?
 You're only trying to save them  because it's your mission.
 But in truth, they look like lowly  beasts to you, do they not?
 Living in the upper realms must be nice.
 I'm sure they're living a life of luxury.
 If you're so jealous, you should just go there.
 It's not that easy.
 Why not?
 Only those who possess strong magical  powers can live in the realms above us.
 There's prejudice against  those who lack magical powers.
 Even though we're all human.
 Huh... Then after I join the Magic  Knights and become the Wizard King,
 I'll get rid of those prejudices and  make our village flourish even more!
 Thank you, Asta.
 If the likes of you could manage that,  we wouldn't be struggling.
 What did you say, you brat?!  I'm older than you!
 You couldn't even join the Magic Knights,  let alone become the Wizard King.
 You don't even have any magical powers.
 Hey!
 Those people you called beasts
 are lives I have to protect!
 I see. So the filthy beasts  are that valuable to you.
 I'll send those icicles right back at y—
 Th-This is...
 Ice and Mist Compound Magic: Endless Ice Cage.
 Do you think you can  protect those beasts now?
 I'm not very partial to the term ""gradually,""
 but this seems like it'll  be the most effective.
 Asta!
 Dissolve.
 Not only can you negate magic, you can repel it, as well.
 But that is not enough to defeat me.
 The blades of ice will  come one after another.
 Now, just try and protect them.
 Damn you!
 It's going to take everything Asta  and I have to protect the villagers.
 Not to mention, my powers  are reaching their limit.
 And they have four guys who are  at least Magic Knight level.
 And that guy's still hiding his true powers!
 This turned out to be one hell  of a first mission for those two!
 This isn't good!
 But if I cut and run now, I'm not a real man!
 It just so happens I'm a lowly  commoner myself! I'll protect you!
 Magna!
 I wonder how long you'll last.
 To think one of you can't  even control her powers...
 I guess the Black Bulls were  truly desperate for members.
 These frail little beasts who can't  even protect themselves...
 If you abandon them, I'll let you live, Magic Knights.
 Like hell I'll abandon them!
 A real man doesn't abandon anybody!
 I'm... royalty.
 I have more magical power  than anyone else here.
 Step back, Lady Noe!
 And yet I'm just holding them back!
 There's no reason for me to be here.
 If you abandon them, I'll let you live...
 That's right. I'm royalty.
 I'm not supposed to die  in a village like this.
 I should just run—
 Miss Magic Knight...
 Save us!
 This little girl is asking for help.
 I'm going to protect them!
 A new spell?
 There's no way...
 I can run now!
 I'll protect them! I'm royalty,
 and a member of the Black Bulls!
 No one can escape from here
 Once again in the small closed off classroom
 The star of the class was shining yet again
 They shine so bright that I close my eyes
 I've thought many times
 That the revolution was within my hands
 Isn't it strange? If you want  to laugh, go ahead and laugh
 The rest of us who were left  behind wanted to become something
 We repeat the same morning over and over
 You're the only one who  can choose your tomorrow
 Let's go beyond our current selves
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Separation and Reunion
 Boar, boar, boar... boar, boar, boar.
 Boar, boar, boar, boar...
 I'm sorry I destroyed the fields!
 Oh, all right. Just don't do it again!
 I won't!
 Boar! Boar!
 Boar!
 Take care!
 Check out Black Clover next week, too!
 Boar!
 That's awesome, Noelle!
 A path will always open, as long as you don't give up!
 We're going to protect everyone,  no matter what!

10,"Asta, Noelle, and Magna encountered
 a mysterious enemy when they  arrived at Saussy Village.
 They fought hard against the enemy's  attack in order to protect the villagers,
 but the enemy's magical powers  were just too great.
 Not only can you negate magic, you can repel it, as well.
 But that is not enough to defeat me.
 The blades of ice will  come one after another.
 Now, just try and protect them.
 Damn it!
 It's going to take everything Asta  and I have to protect the villagers.

 There's no way...
 I can run now!
 A new spell?
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
 As their owners mature, new spells  are engraved into the grimoires.
 Maturity can stem from the wizard's  magical powers growing through training,
 or improving the creativity  of their magical powers.
 But sometimes, it can come  from a rise or change
 in their emotional state,  or gaining new resolve.
 I'll protect them! I'm royalty,
 and a member of the Black Bulls!
 Those Who Protect
 Grey words can't make anything happen
 I know, yeah I know
 Wishing to fly freely across the sky
 I dreamed it all my life
 Step by step I go, though  it's a doubtful world 
 Don't care how much I fall
 Instinct is my guide, I never give up
 To faraway future, I burst out running
 Go beyond even the unseen fears
 The vision I had, so I can be myself
 Someday I will write the next page
 You are my hope
 Like that page from someday
 I was able to meet you
 I call this a miracle
 Miss...
 W-Well, I guess you're not so tough after all.
 Look at that power!
 Hey, Lady Noe! What'd I tell you? You can do it if you try!
 What? What is this magical power?
 The beast had been waiting for  his chance to fight back.
 For the moment when he could sink his teeth
 into his prey's throat.
 The three of you
 also had enough magical power to  join the Magic Knights, did you not?
 I don't have any magical powers!
 But I'm going to kick your ass!
 Lord Heath!
 Stupidsta!
 He... He did it?
 He broke my momentum by  making me slip on a patch of ice?
 Though your sword can negate magic,
 it appears that you're just  a normal human after all.
 Now it's my turn.
 May you sleep... for eternity.
 A-Asta!
 That spell possesses  immense magical power.
 But it's only a matter of time.
 I should be able to create an  entrance big enough for one person.
 It should take about 25 seconds.
 You lot seem to greatly enjoy wasting my time.
 You will pay a heavy price for that.
 I don't have much power left,  but I have to fight.
 Fire and ice. In terms of magical  attributes, I have the upper hand.
 But he has enough magical power  to turn that advantage around.
 He's just too strong.
 Sorry, Mister Yami.
 I don't think I'm going to win against...
 I'm not done yet!
 Too slow!
 Asta!
 I'm surprised you're still alive.
 You're quite resilient. However...
 You won't be able to swing  that sword with those wounds.
 Not yet!
 You're no wild boar.
 I'm not done yet!
 Stop. Don't make me waste any more time.
 That's amazing, Magna!
 To think that someone from Rayaka  would end up being a Magic Knight!
 You're the pride of our village!
 Let's lift him up!
 Magna!
 Magna!
 Magna!
 I see. That's wonderful. Good, good.
 Well done, Magna.
 Yeah.
 Now you're more than just a delinquent.
 Huh?
 This is from me.
 Old Man...
 Well?
 It looks good on you. Become the best man you can.
 Yeah!
 I'm not going to give up until the end.
 What good would it do if I gave up?
 This spell... It's probably a lot easier  to get outside than in, right?
 Uh... Yes, I think so.
 I'm leaving the villagers to you, Lady Noe!
 H-Hey!
 You have no chance of winning.  Why won't you give up?
 If I give up, who's going to protect them?
 I've realized something.
 It's not just because of our promise.
 I'm going to become the Wizard King
 so I can protect everyone!
 The Wizard King? What a foolish dream.
 Unfortunately, you'll be dead in one minute.
 That's not happening, you dumbass!
 If you want to kill him,
 you're going to have to get  through me, his senior, first!
 Magna!
 You know... You're quite the man, Asta.
 You fool. You've just hastened your death.
 Thirty seconds.
 Bring it on!
 Here we go, Asta!
 Huh?
 Time for an initiation!
 Take this! My last remaining bit of magic!
 Soul Ball!
 Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!
 So this is your final spell?
 How wasteful.
 It's time.
 It's not a waste!
 They drew us in with a decoy,  then used our blind spot...
 Magic reflection!
 I'm okay?
 You'd better thank me, you mohawked delinquent.
 Yes! Yes! I was able to control my magic!
 You never shut up, do you?
 These flames... won't go out?
 Then I'll just freeze them over!
 Not yet!
 I can still move!
 W-Wait...
 Like hell I will!
 These flames... won't go out?
 Then I'll just freeze them over!
 Not yet!
 I can still move!
 W-Wait...
 Like hell I will!
 Impossible...
 I...
 lost to this brat?
 I wanted... to be of more use... to the master...
 They did it?
 Miss?
 Yes. We beat him for sure this time.
 First, my Flame Magic:  Prison Death Scattershot,
 and now, Flame Binding Magic:  Flame Bondage Formation.
 I guess you're more talented  than you look. Have some praise.
 Shut up! I'm your senior!
 Why are you looking down on me?!
 Well, you're physically below—
 Magna!
 What are you doing?! You need  to follow through properly!
 So cold!
 You've still got a ways to go, Lady Noe!
 More importantly, it looks like one got away. Ugh, I blew it! Damn it!
 How'd you like that? Some lowly commoners just won.
 How'd you like that, damn it?!
 Asta!
 Wait, he's asleep?!
 Honestly, he's so ridiculous.
 He's stupid, loud, and a lowly commoner...
 But he's sort of amazing.
 Whew... We're saved.
 He's just a boy.
 Is he really a commoner like us?
 Magna, young lady... Thank you.
 No problem!
 It was nothing.
 You're our saviors!
 What's that? An anti-bird?
 You finally awake, you jerk?
 I'm going to rest a bit more  and then escort you to
 the royal capital on my Crazy Cyclone.
 Spend the rest of your life atoning for what  you did to those villagers, you bastards.
 So my magic is sealed.
 You're going to spill everything  to the Magic Knights,
 including who you guys are  and what your motives are!
 I refuse.
 It appears the end has come.
 There was a magic item inside him?
 Ice Magic: Ice Burial.
 Wha—
 Talk about resolve. Is there  someone he was that loyal to?
 You idiot!
 He went through all that...  What was he after, anyway?
 What do...
 What do you think life is?!
 I'm never going to acknowledge these jerks!
 Never!
 Grandpa...
 Let's go home, Nick.
 Grandpa really loved the view from here.
 Yeah.
 So, Nick, I heard
 that Old Man Seihi was the only  one to stand up to those guys.
 Your grandpa was a real man.
 Grandpa sounded really happy.
 He said that even though it was
 just gambling, he still beat some Magic Knights.
 Yeah.
 He gave this to me as a gift.
 He even bought lots of yummy  food for everyone in the village.
 He never got to be one, but Grandpa  always admired the Magic Knights.
 Yeah.
 And they were also his regret.
 Regret?
 He always regretted not working  harder when he was younger.
 Yeah...
 But... he seemed really  happy about the fact that
 Magna was working hard for the both of them.
 Yeah.
 Hey, do you think... I'll be able  to become a Magic Knight, too?
 Of course!
 Nothing's impossible!
 Your future is something that  you decide for yourself!
 Not only am I a commoner, but I've got no magic powers, and I still made it in!
 But you've gotta work super extra hard!
 Give it your all!
 Do your best.
 Yeah!
 By the time you join the Magic Knights,
 I'm going to be working even harder, doing even more missions,
 and I'll be even closer to  becoming the Wizard King.
 Jeez. There you go talking nonsense again.
 But you need to dream big. That's what it means to be a man!
 I'll be waiting for you, kid!
 Right!
 Yeah!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow!
 What do you have against my head,  you stupid bird?! You wanna fight?!
 Why, you...
 What's that stone?
 Oh, that's a charm that my grandpa had.
 Hey, that's really important!
 Let go! Give it back!
 You can have it. Apparently that bird really likes it.
 It's the least I can do to  repay you guys for saving us.
 O-Okay...
 Those spiteful little eyes...
 Th-They're so cute!
 You can come over here, too!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 What is your problem with my head?! I'm gonna barbecue you!
 Come back here!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 The heck are you doing, you jerk?!
 So Heath was... I see.
 So the magic stone fell into  the hands of the Black Bulls.
 Yes.
 No matter.
 We can take care of the  Black Bulls at any time.
 Let them hold on to the  magic stone for a while.
 Our master's resurrection is close at hand.
 No one can escape from here

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 How'd you like that? Some lowly commoners just won.

 Sounds like you guys went through hell!
 Why does he sound so happy about that?
 Someone even died.
 Hey, Captain, I don't think  this is a laughing matter.
 Being depressed isn't going to  bring Old Man Seihi back. Right?
 Yes, sir! It's just as you say, sir.
 Old Man Seihi liked to see  everyone happy and energetic.
 Come on. You guys should be laughing, too.
 Come on!
 Louder!
 You, too, Lady Noe!
 That's how it should be.
 What happened to Old Man Seihi really is a shame,
 but you three were able  to protect the villagers.
 Be proud of that.
 Well done. Great job, you idiots.
 Yes, sir!
 Thanks.
 What's that?
 You moron! You don't even know  the Magic Knights' salute?!
 Take a good look!
 These fingers symbolize the clover.
 Go on, give it a try.
 Yes, sir!
 Well done!
 We're back.
 Great job, you three.
 Miss Vanessa! Finral!
 Captain, we went to the Magic Investigation Department.
 Good. Did you find anything out?
 Who the heck's behind all this?!
 I'll find their hideout and raid it!
 I'll beat the crap out of  the guy who got away, too!
 Well, you see,
 they investigated the item he left behind,
 but still don't have a clue.
 How useless can they be?
 You fools!
 Stop breaking stuff!
 Sorry!
 But that pocket watch is pretty nice.
 Yes, and from what you said  about how they were acting,
 they were all of very high status.
 So they're royalty or nobles.
 Oh, who's this little guy? He's adorable.
 How's it adorable?!
 I-It is adorable!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Why, you little!
 Hey, come here.
 You ugly little bird!  I'll turn you into fried chicken!
 I won't let you turn him into fried chicken!
 Say your prayers!
 Don't you dare!
 Are you two trying to break the building?!
 We're sorry!
 You're the one breaking everything, though.
 All right, listen up.
 It doesn't matter if the ones behind  this are royalty or nobility.
 We're going to let the  Investigation Department
 take care of this,  and we'll wait for their report.
 More importantly, I've got some good news.
 Good news?
 Wanna hear it?
 Of course!
 Your actions have been acknowledged  by the Wizard King himself!
 The Wizard King?!
 You've been given a star!
 Whoa, seriously?!
 All right!
 Yeah!
 Wow.
 Heck yeah!
 Congrats.
 So, what are stars?
 Don't get so excited if you  don't know what they are!
 Stars are awarded by the Wizard  King based on our performance.
 What are they good for?
 Well... They're like an honor.
 Honor?!
 That's right, Asta! Honor!
 It's a badge of honor for a man!
 There's a lady here, too.
 It's a badge of honor for a man and a woman!
 That makes no sense.
 The various Magic Knights squads  compete to get the most stars.
 The number of stars indicates  how much work a squad has done.
 I see!
 Speaking of, the Golden Dawn is currently  at the top with seventy stars.
 Seventy?!
 What about us? How many  do the Black Bulls have?
 We can't lose to the Golden Dawn!
 We...
 finally have a nice, even negative thirty.
 Negative?!
 What?
 We're finally only a hundred  away from the Golden Dawn.
 A hundred?!
 It's going to take forever to catch  up and beat them! Damn it, Yuno!
 Not happening.
 Should I really be in this squad?
 One other thing.
 Here's your pay for this month.
 Huh?
 It's money! There's at  least 200,000 yuls here!
 Thanks!
 Thanks, Captain! I'm going to eat  lots of yummy things with this!
 Yeah, eat up.
 Hey, Captain! How much would  it take for you to fight me?
 Well? Well?
 I won't.
 Aw, come on!
 I was thinking about buying new clothes  for my goddess, my little sister, Marie.
 What do you think will look best on her?
 Don't ask me.
 No idea.
 Tomorrow's gonna be a day off,  so don't let it go to waste.
 I'm gonna go on tons of dates!
 Do whatever you want.
 Thanks!
 Thank you for everything, Captain.
 We should all go out somewhere and  have fun. What do you guys think?
 This isn't much.
 You moron!
 You could buy at least ten years'  worth of tatoes with this money!
 Tatoes? What are those?
 Potatoes from Hage Village that taste  bland and have a questionable texture.
 That sounds awful.
 They aren't! Sister Lily can  make anything taste good!
 And who's that?
 The woman I'm going to marry someday!
 What?
 But aren't sisters women of the cloth?  I don't think they can get married.
 I-It'll work out somehow!  I'll go beyond all limitations!
 Are you stupid?
 Congrats on your first payday!
 What do you plan to do with it?
 I haven't decided.
 What about you, little boy?
 I-I'm going to send some money  back to the church in Hage.
 That's a great idea, Asta!  That's the manly thing to do!
 Right?! Do you send money back, too?
 Of course I do! But...
 But?
 Only after I've increased it a hundredfold!
 You never learn, do you?
 A man's gotta take risks!
 By ""man,"" you must mean ""moron.""
 Sending some money back is  fine, but don't send it all.
 Use a little bit for yourself.
 Sh-Should I?
 But what should I use it for?
 Let's go shopping in the  castle town tomorrow.
 You, too.
 Shopping?
 I'll take you both.
 Sister Lily, how are you doing?
 I'm doing well.
 All of the kind senior squad members  are taking good care of me.
 Asta, stand right here.
 What are we doing?
 Don't move.
 Flame Magic:
 Exploding...
 Fireball!
 Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!
 I told you not to move!
 I didn't!
 Also, I did really well on my first mission,
 and received a star from the Wizard King  for my excellent performance.
 At this rate, I might be able to  become the Wizard King by next month.
 I want to become the Wizard King and make  this a world where everyone can be happy.
 Then I'll come for you, so please marry me.
 ""Oh, I just had my first payday,  so I'm sending you the money.""
 I'm done!
 This is an awesome letter,  if I do say so myself.
 I wonder if Sister Lily  will be moved to tears.
 The Wizard King...
 The Wizard King, huh?
 I wonder what he's like...
 Have you ever been to the castle town?
 I haven't.
 I guess royals and nobles wouldn't  really have reason to go very often.
 How about you, little boy?
 I just passed through when I went to  take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.
 Then let's have a lot of fun today.
 Hey, stop touching me.
 I can't help it! Do you want me to fall?
 I can't stop thinking about  him for some reason. Ugh...
 Again?!
 The Clover Kingdom is split between the  Noble Realm, where royalty and nobility live,
 Saussy
 Spade Kingdom
 Forsaken Realm
 Rayaka
 Heart  Kingdom
 Common Realm
 Noble Realm
 Diamond  Kingdom
 the Common Realm, where the commoners live,
 and the Forsaken Realm,  where the peasants live.
 The Castle Town of Kikka,  where Asta and Yuno took
 the Magic Knights Entrance Exam,  is in the Common Realm.
 It's still amazing!
 It's very lively.
 I hope I can bring Sister Lily and the  kids from the church here someday.
 What about me?!
 Oh?
 Marie, my goddess, I'll be there soon.
 I want to see your smiling face as soon  as possible. I can't contain myself.
 Mister!
 That voice...
 So you've come again.
 I have.
 I'm not going to lose this month!
 I won't, either!
 The ultra ultimate super  large serving of everything!
 I dare you to eat all of it!
 Thanks for the nummies!
 Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...
 I'm getting heartburn just watching her.
 Do you have some time, miss?
 Want to have some tea with me?
 Do I look like I have time?
 You can bring your kids along.  I know a great place—
 You actually think they're my kids?!
 They're my brother and sister!
 I have to hurry home so we can open the shop.
 I don't have any time to mess around.
 Man, I love tough young ladies.
 Miss, want to have some fun with me?
 Don't get too far ahead, little boy.
 I'm so excited!
 Don't you two want to buy anything?
 There are just so many things,  I don't know what to get.
 I don't really...
 Hey, those robes... They're Magic Knights.
 That mark... Ugh, it's the Black Bulls!
 That's the lush witch Vanessa.
 Are the cute girl next to her and  the little kid also Black Bulls?
 It's probably best to stay away.
 They're starting to get a bit restless.
 It's fine. Magic Knights being  in town helps deter crime.
 Not to mention, some fine  gentlemen might approach us.
 I've bought some healing herbs,
 as well as some shique ointment,  which acts as a poison antidote.
 That should do it.
 I bought what I needed, so why don't  we go somewhere a bit more quiet?
 Somewhere quiet?
 I know just the place.
 This way.
 That way?
 Isn't this just some alley?
 It's a dead end.
 Huh?!
 Come now.
 Whoa!
 Black Market
 This is the Black Market.
 The Black Market?
 It's a bit dangerous, but they have  some very effective magical items.
 Hey, Vanessa. I got some good stuff in.
 Hey! I'll take a look later.
 Awesome!
 Oh, you don't seem too excited.
 Well, no.
 I guess I can't blame you.
 Royals and nobles won't set foot  in here because of their prejudices.
 But you can't control your  magical powers yet, right?
 Th-That's right. Why?
 They have items that can help you  control your magical powers here.
 If you can find an item that's a good  fit for you, and adjust your powers,
 you might be able to control them.
 Control my powers...
 Why don't we take a look around?
 S-Sure.
 It's really lively over there.
 You two are a bit too  young to go in there yet.
 Amateurs shouldn't spend too much time  in there, or it could ruin their lives.
 All right!
 Let's do this! Let's do this!
 I'm going to make my paycheck  grow a hundredfold!
 Hey, I know that guy!
 Damn it, I lost again! Bah-ha...
 I can see the future.
 Bah-ha! That old lady's strong.
 I really shouldn't be wasting time  here, anyway. I have work to do.
 Well, the job's to catch a purse-snatcher.
 Is that even a job for a Magic Knight?
 Bah-ha...
 But the captain would get  real scary if I refused.
 You got a problem with that? I'll slice you in two!
 Bah-ha! I finally managed  to join the Magic Knights,
 but it's the Green Praying Mantises.
 I'm a praying mantis. A frickin' bug.
 All I do every day is run errands.
 When I finally got an actual mission,  I got used as bait and almost died.
 I'm constipated and my hair's thinning.
 Bah-ha, damn it.
 Hey, she's cute!
 What about this? You could probably  use this to stabilize your powers.
 It looks so cheesy.
 Well, just give it a try.
 Bah-ha?!
 You shouldn't have been walking there!
 Bah-ha! Well, well,  what brings you two down here?
 The Black Market is no place  for you lovely ladies. Bah-ha!
 Did you get lost?
 As an elite member of the Magic Knights,  I shall guide you out of here.
 Get lost, you insect.
 Bah-ha...
 Hey! I found something really cool!
 You didn't actually buy that, did you?
 It talks!
 So you did.
 Look!
 We are hoomans.
 See?
 What, exactly?
 Bah-ha!
 Th-That's...
 Huh? Hey, you're Bah-ha!
 It's Sekke! Bah-ha!
 How've you been, Bah-ha?
 The name's Bah-ha! No, wait, Sekke!
 Who's that?
 I took the Entrance Exam with him.
 Ah, you're a member of the  Green Praying Mantises.
 He's with two beautiful girls?! Wait, no...
 They're both members of  the Black Bulls, too.
 Asta, you bastard!  You're making me jealous.
 Besides, it's all your fault that  I ended up in the Green Praying Mantises.
 Bah-ha! You infuriating bah-hastard!
 Th-Thief!
 My winnings! Stop!
 No one can escape from here
 Once again in the small closed off classroom
 The star of the class was shining yet again
 They shine so bright that I close my eyes
 I've thought many times
 That the revolution was within my hands
 Isn't it strange? If you want  to laugh, go ahead and laugh
 The rest of us who were left  behind wanted to become something
 We repeat the same morning over and over
 You're the only one who  can choose your tomorrow
 Let's go beyond our current selves

 Asta, you have yet to learn  the ways of the bah-ha.
 Bah-ha!
 The ways of the bah-ha?!
 Bah-ha! This is my chance  to make a name for myself!
 I'm going to catch the thief and  get praise from the Wizard King, ha!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 This is the Black Market.
 It's a bit dangerous, but they have  some very effective magical items.
 Damn it, I lost again! Bah-ha...
 I can see the future.
 That old lady's good.

 The Wizard King Saw
 Grey words can't make anything happen
 I know, yeah I know
 Wishing to fly freely across the sky
 I dreamed it all my life
 Step by step I go, though  it's a doubtful world 
 Don't care how much I fall
 Instinct is my guide, I never give up
 To faraway future, I burst out running
 Go beyond even the unseen fears
 The vision I had, so I can be myself
 Someday I will write the next page
 You are my hope
 Like that page from someday
 I was able to meet you
 I call this a miracle
 Are you out shopping with these girls?
 Well, today's our day off.
 Bah-ha! Must be nice.
 Even if it's your day off, shouldn't  you be finding some basic tasks
 to do for points, instead of messing around?
 I heard the Black Bulls  have negative stars—
 Stars! Oh, yeah! Listen to this!
 We got a star from the  Wizard King on our first mission!
 What?! You can't be serious!
 Well done, you two.
 They're serious?!
 Calm down, me.
 Bah-ha, bah-ha...
 I-I see! Seems like you're working hard.
 What about you, Bah-ha?
 It's Sekke!
 W-Well, I... The other day...
 I-I got my second star...
 Th-Thief!
 My winnings! Stop!
 That old lady...
 He's got some nerve,  stealing in front of Magic Knights.
 No kidding. But everything will be  fine if we leave it to the little boy.
 I'm counting on you.
 Bah-ha!
 I'm not going to let you  steal all the glory, Asta!
 Bronze Creation Magic: Sekke Shooting Star!
 Lame!
 Gross!
 Leave this to me. You lovely ladies  can go relax with that old lady.
 Ew!
 No!
 Bah-ha!
 Hold it!
 Just try and catch me.
 Stop, dang it!
 What the...
 Sorry!
 I finally lost him.
 Not yet!
 He's so damn persistent!
 I-I can't see!
 I'm not letting you get away!
 How is he catching up to me  when he's only running?
 I have to do something about that cloud, or I'll never catch up.
 If it's a cloud created by magic...
 Right!
 Do you actually think you can cut  through my Bandit's Cloud Wind—
 What?!
 You're not getting away!
 Bah-ha!
 Bah-ha!
 I'm going to take the glory on this one!
 That's awesome!
 Bah-ha!
 Bah-ha! You're under arrest!
 He's my prey! Bah-hahaha!
 Bah-hahaha... huh?
 Bah-ha?
 That's...
 Knock off that stupid laugh of yours!
 I'm taking you down with me...
 What's wrong, Bah-ha?
 Poison... Poison's coursing through me.
 Hang in there, Bah-ha!
 Bah... ha...
 Am I going to die?
 Now that I think about it, I was  once trying to get to the top, too...
 Bah-ha!
 I hate that I have to leave  everything to him, but...
 You're the man who defeated me.
 Make it all the way to the  top for my sake, too.
 I'm leaving my dream to you!
 Bah-ha...
 Bah-haha...
 I guess going out like this isn't so bad.
 Bah... ha...
 Bah-ha! Bah-ha!
 Huh? I'm not dying?
 Bah-ha?!
 Wh-What are you—
 Don't leave something so important with me!
 Survive and make your own dream come true!
 Don't give up, you idiot!
 Come on. There's no way this would kill you.
 Bah-ha?
 It's just a momentary numbing poison.
 Put this Shique ointment on it, and you'll be better in no time.
 Bah-ha! Make sure you stay diligent  until the next time I see you, Asta!
 See ya, bah-ha!
 See ya, Bah-ha!
 On the outside, our little boy  definitely looks younger than him,
 but it seems our little boy is  much stronger on the inside.
 Don't let it get taken again, ma'am.
 Thank you, Magic Knights.
 See ya, ma'am.
 Be careful.
 Live a long, happy life.
 Magic negation, eh?
 That's a type of magic  I've never seen before.
 Actually... is that even magic?
 Yami sure took in an interesting kid.
 This is why I can't stop  wandering around in disguise.
 I finally found you!
 Uh-oh...
 What in the world are you doing, Wizard King?
 28th Wizard King Julius Novachrono
 What am I doing? I'm strolling through  the castle town looking for new magic.
 What?! Have you any  awareness of your position?!
 Encounters with magic are once in a lifetime.
 That doesn't—
 You never know what kind of magic  you're going to encounter and where.
 Listen to me, you magic nerd!
 Now, now, calm down, Marx.
 Isn't that the new kid from William's squad?
 Well, I'm off to encounter even  more new magic. I'll be back later.
 Wait, damn it!
 Member of the Golden Dawn Klaus Lunettes
 The Golden Dawn's new recruit, Yuno...
 Member of the Golden Dawn Yuno
 The candidate that every Magic Knight  Captain wanted at the Entrance Exam.
 Member of the Golden Dawn Mimosa Vermillion
 And then we have the other new recruit,  Mimosa Vermillion, from the royal family.
 Their first mission is...
 to act as bodyguards  for Salim de Hapshass.
 We are to escort the son of Hapshass, who serves in the House of Lords,
 to our ally, the Heart Kingdom?
 You know who Lord Hapshass is, don't you?
 I know his name.
 I've only heard negative things about him, such as that he's new money.
 I'm sure that's why he's worried that his son,  who is going to study in the Heart Kingdom,
 might be attacked by bandits on the way.
 But there are many powerful mages  among the lord's family...
 Apparently, he feels having Magic Knights act as his bodyguards will be safer.
 Lord Hapshass makes very generous  donations to the Magic Knights every year,
 so it's rather hard to decline.
 Do you object?
 N-No!
 We need to accept every kind of mission.  That will also benefit the Clover Kingdom.
 Yes, sir. I am aware of that.
 Take Mimosa with you, too.
 I'm sure with you along as their mentor,  they'll be more than enough.
 I'm counting on you to  look after the new recruits.
 Salim de Hapshass lost to Yuno in the final  part of the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.
 He ended up being unable  to join the Magic Knights.
 So why was Yuno appointed  as one of his bodyguards?
 My first mission... I'm so nervous.
 Klaus, Yuno, it's a  pleasure to work with you.
 Yeah.
 Don't let your guard down, Mimosa.
 Y-Yes, sir.
 That goes for you, too.
 I know.
 You insolent newbie.
 How have you been, Yuno?
 Don't look so scary.
 I requested you as my bodyguard  because I want to apologize.
 I hear that you intend to  become the Wizard King.
 How did you know?
 You were chosen by all of the captains.  You could've joined any squad,
 and you ended up choosing the  Golden Dawn, so I had a feeling.
 The more you achieve from now on,
 the more your name will spread  throughout the kingdom...
 Yuno, the one who bears the  four-leaf clover grimoire.
 Make sure your dream of becoming  the Wizard King comes true.
 And then I'll be able to  brag to my future children
 that I once fought the Wizard King.
 And then they'll say, ""Daddy, you're so cool!""
 We have some time before we  get to the Heart Kingdom.
 Could you tell me a little  more about yourself?
 I won't pester you if you're not up for it.
 I'm from Hage Village.
 I've heard of it. It's a village  in the Forsaken Realm, isn't it?
 I think that's where the legend  of the first Wizard King
 who defeated the demons comes from.
 It's not just a legend. A giant  demon skull is actually still there.
 Oh?
 Apparently, I was found abandoned in  front of a church when I was a baby.
 I've never seen my parents, and I have no idea who they are.
 The church was very poor, but the father  and sister there took very good care of me.
 I'm very grateful to them.
 No problems so far,
 but there must be someone  in the Hapshass family
 who can use transportation magic.
 How did we get stuck with this?
 Not to mention, we're the only bodyguards.
 If there was a real threat of an attack,  wouldn't they have more bodyguards?
 There are too many unknowns on this mission.
 Oh?
 What's that?
 Those clouds...
 They're a little creepy.
 I'll go check them out.
 Hey! No one said you could—
 Be on your guard, Mimosa.
 Y-Yes, sir.
 Yuno, protect the ship!
 I intend to.
 Go!
 That was magnificent!
 Were those men not after Salim?
 You saved me back there. Well done, Yuno.
 I didn't even have the opportunity  to use my Lightning God Rising Salim.
 I'm even more interested in you now.
 I know. Why don't you take me to your town?
 I want to see the place where you were born.
 I want to know where you had  to live to grow up so strong.
 Lord Salim, that's rather out of the way.
 Besides, given what just happened,
 we don't know what else  might happen along the way,
 so we should head straight  for the Heart Kingdom—
 No matter who may come after me,  you three will protect me, won't you?
 Well, yes, of course.
 But for nobility to go to a peasant  village in the Forsaken Realm...
 It'll just be a quick stop.
 Right...
 I'm sure Yuno would like to see  everyone back at his church, too. Right?
 That's not your concern.
 Now, now...
 So that's the demon's skull!
 It's quite big. And on top of it is  a statue of the first Wizard King.
 I see. So where is this church?
 There.
 Oh?
 Yuno!
 Welcome back!
 Thanks.
 You've grown so much!
 I haven't changed. It's only  been two months since I left.
 Really? But... Yes. Your face has matured.
 You look more like an adult.
 What brings you here today?
 We're stopping by briefly during our mission.
 Why must I visit this village  in the Forsaken Realm?
 Oh, um, hello. I'm Sister Lily.
 I'm Klaus Lunettes of the honorable  Golden Dawn, led by William Vangeance.
 I'm a mentor to these new recruits.
 Hello, Klaus. Thank you  for looking after Yuno.
 I've heard of you from Yuno's letters.
 Letters?
 What did you write about me?
 Honestly...
 I'm Mimosa Vermillion,  one of Yuno's colleagues.
 I've heard of you, too, Mimosa.
 Oh!
 What did you write about me?
 Ah, what a beauty.
 Huh?
 I am from Hapshass Village,
 the son of Lord Hapshass and the heir to  the Hapshass family, Salim de Hapshass.
 It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
 Oh, I-I'm so sorry! I just...
 N-No, it's all right, Sister.
 Yuno! It's Yuno!
 How are you?!
 Welcome back!
 What are you doing here, Yuno?
 Whoa, that robe's awesome!  That's the Golden Dawn's.
 It's the real thing!
 Yay, it's Yuno! Yay! Yay!
 Yay!
 Hey, where's Asta?
 Where's Asta?
 Are you keeping in contact with Asta?
 No.
 Are you staying the night tonight?  You are, right?
 Um...
 Unfortunately, we're just stopping by.
 We have to hurry on our way.
 Aww!
 Now, now, we don't have  to be in such a hurry.
 We can spare an hour or so.
 But—
 In that case, I'll prepare  some famous Hage tato dishes.
 Yuno, stay and have some food.
 That goes for all of you. Please, come in.
 Wow, what a splendid church.
 I've never seen such a  tiny church. It's so cute.
 Tiny?!
 It's like a playhouse.
 Wha—
 Yuno, tell us about the Magic Knights.
 Yeah, tell us!
 Us!
 Why must I enter such a filthy little church?
 No one can escape from here

 So these are Hage's famous tatoes.
 I'm not sure if they'll be to your liking,  Lord Salim, but help yourself.
 They're so dry and flaky. I've never had  anything that made me so thirsty before.
 But... it's delicious.
 Oh, thank goodness!
 It would seem that you're  a splendid cook, Miss Lily.
 I'm not all that good, really...
 Please, eat as much as you'd like.
 You too, Klaus, Mimosa.
 Right...
 Why must a noble such as myself  eat this unknown thing?
 Oh, this makes me so thirsty.
 Yes, isn't it wonderful?
 Both Yuno and Asta sent us money  from their first pay as Magic Knights.
 And then... We were able to  buy so many tatoes that we can
 feed the children as much as  they want to eat every day.
 Actually, couldn't you feed us  something besides tatoes, too?
 Don't be picky! Look how big  Yuno got from eating tatoes!
 Yuno, it's wonderful that you're sending  money home when you're just a newcomer.
 It's nothing.
 Yuno, thank you for everything.
 You've helped us out a lot. And not just with the tatoes.
 We were able to plug up  that hole in the floor.
 We even dug up a well in the yard.
 Thanks, Yuno!
 Thanks!
 Asta's been sending money, too?
 Yes. To think he'd be able to do that...
 How much is Asta sending?
 Huh? Um...
 Whisper, whisper, whisper...
 I win!
 Starting next month,
 I'll send all of my pay.
 Huh?! Really, you don't have to.
 We'll be fine for a while  with the amount you sent us.
 I appreciate the thought.
 I'll send it!
 R-Really? Thanks...
 Lord Salim, we should be on our way.
 Oh, it won't hurt to stay a bit longer.
 In the future, it'll be important for nobles to have more knowledge of the world.
 Miss Lily, may I have some more water?
 Of course.
 Oh, it's empty. I'll go get some more.
 I'll do it.
 It's fine. You relax, Yuno.
 Oh, one moment.
 It's chilly at night.
 Thank you very much.
 I guess you're a gentleman.
 Oh, it's nothing. My body  just acted on its own.
 It's just proper etiquette for a noble.
 Yuno...
 What happened?
 Where's Sister?
 That brooch...
 It's the same one the men who were  after Lord Salim were wearing.
 H-How awful!
 Of course! It must be because  I put my robe on her.
 Miss Lily was taken instead of me!
 Yes, that must be it.
 Is Sister going to be okay? Is she, Yuno?
 Yuno...
 Don't worry. I'll go save her.
 Yuno! I'll go, too!
 Me, too!
 Me, too!
 No.
 I need all of you to stay here.
 I'll be fine on my own.
 Wait.
 Our mission is to escort Lord Salim.
 We don't know when the enemy  will come after him again.
 We must leave at once.
 B-But...
 But Sister...
 Hey, Four-eyes!
 Who are you calling ""Four-eyes""?
 Um, Four... Er, Klaus, um...
 You stay out of this, Mimosa.
 Yuno, I'm sure you're  worried about the sister,
 but let's leave her to the authorities  who have jurisdiction here.
 We're leaving immediately.
 Let us go, Lord Salim.
 Yuno, Mimosa.
 Yes, sir.
 Yuno.
 I'm not leaving.
 Huh?
 We must fulfill our mission.
 Disobeying an order is a crime.
 Even so, I'm going to go save her.
 Yuno!
 How dare he...
 You're confusing recklessness  with courage, Yuno.
 You know my name?
 Take this!
 Meha!
 Towering Tornado.
 What?!
 One down,
 four to go.
 I'm not going to kill you or anything,
 but I've got to at least  rough you up a little bit.
 I see. So you were after me all along.
 You're brighter than you look.
 Can't breathe, eh? Then drown!
 How is this magic supposed to drown me?
 He's...
 This is how
 you're supposed to drown.
 That's two.
 Looks like you completely  fell for the footsteps I laid.
 Take that, and that, and that, and that!
 Not bad. In that case...
 There! Think you can stop that?!
 Take that!
 What?!
 Why is size the only thing  that matters to you people?
 Damn it! In that case...
 Too late.
 That's three. Two more to go.
 Sister...
 Hold it right there.
 Good boy.
 It'd be a shame
 if the sister's pretty face got burned.
 Yuno.
 It looks like you have a talent for magic.
 If you see someone in need,  make sure you help them.
 Promise me.
 You too, Asta.
 Huh? Did you say something?
 Now then, Yuno. Why don't  you hand over your grimoire?
 You won't be able to do anything without it.
 What do you plan to do with my grimoire?
 Maybe I'll sell it. Maybe I'll burn it.
 I honestly don't care.
 Without your grimoire, you'll be useless as a Magic Knight.
 Is that your plan?
 What if I refuse?
 Are you going to?
 That's a good boy. Hand it over.
 Then I'll let you take  your precious sister home.
 I refuse.
 What?! Don't you get it? The sister—
 I won't let you harm her.
 Are you going to attack me?  No matter how you attack—
 I'm not the one who's going to attack.
 Huh? Then who—
 Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!
 Mimosa.
 Yes, sir.
 She's all right.
 I hope you defeated all of them.
 There should be one more.
 Did he flee?
 What would you have done if I hadn't come?
 Why did you come?
 Do you think I'm some kind of fool?
 He does!
 Listen well, Yuno. Our duty as Magic  Knights is to protect the people.
 I thought it was strange.
 These men were after you, not Salim.
 Do you think a noble would want  to come to a village like this?
 Do you think they'd happily eat those tatoes?
 Sorry to say it, but I definitely wouldn't.
 There's no way they'd accidentally take  Sister Lily instead of Salim, either.
 Besides...
 It was strange for Salim, whom you defeated,  to specifically ask you to escort him.
 And that's when we used my Plant  Creation Magic: Flower of Truth.
 It's all your fault I wasn't able  to join the Magic Knights, Yuno!
 Who cares about your stupid four-leaf  grimoire, damn it?! I'll steal it from you!
 I'll get my daddy to hurt you!
 I'll get my revenge!
 He coughed up everything.
 I'm still surprised you managed to find me.
 That was also thanks to Mimosa's abilities.
 Flower Creation Magic:  Magic Flower Guidepost.
 Let's see...
 Oh, there he is.
 That's why we were able to back you up.
 Thank you.
 You helped me out a lot, Klaus, Mimosa.
 No problem.
 Shut up!
 Honestly, revenge? How pathetic!
 It's only natural that you lost to Yuno.
 Our honorable captain of the Golden Dawn,  William Vangeance, chose him!
 That means he's truly that talented!
 Klaus...
 Don't get the wrong idea.
 I still haven't acknowledged you.
 Oh, dear.
 Right...
 But I'll overlook your insolence this time,  since this was all Salim's doing.
 So what shall we do?
 Take him to the royal capital?
 No, let's just leave them.
 Are you sure?
 As long as they don't go  near Hage Village again.
 You heard him. You're free to go.
 Don't ever try anything like this again.
 Do you understand?
 You're just a peasant.
 Getting you to let your guard  down was all part of my plan!
 Huh?
 God of Lighting Rising Salim!
 Water Creation Magic: Holy Strike of Love!
 Stop this! Show some remorse  for what you've done!
 All of you, too!
 Y-Yes, ma'am!
 I almost want to scout the  sister for the Magic Knights.
 Yuno, we're going to take them  to the royal capital after all.
 By the way, where did the other one go?
 No idea.
 Man, that was fun.
 If they were actually in trouble, I was  going save them, but I didn't need to at all.
 William's newbie is pretty impressive, too.
 How long do you intend to fool around?
 You're too loud!
 You need to return at once!  Your work is piling up!
 All right, all right.
 It's not healthy to be so  irritated all the time.
 Whose fault do you think that is, huh?!
 Thank goodness you're safe!
 Thank goodness!
 Goodness!
 Awesome as usual, Yuno.
 Well, he is a Magic Knight.
 Klaus, Mimosa, thank you both very much.
 Don't mention it.
 Salim was behind all of this. How unsightly.
 Please, please, help yourselves. Let me repay you with more tato dishes.
 They've gotten a bit cold, but please eat as much as you'd like!
 It's not bad.
 You're not very honest, are you, Klaus?
 It's good.
 A star?
 The Wizard King was pleased with  your work, and we received a star.
 Thank you very much! It's an honor!
 I never thought I'd get  one on my first mission.
 But I don't feel as if we did  enough to earn a star.
 After you brought Salim in,  he ended up confessing
 to various evil deeds Lord Hapshass had done.
 Bribes, fraudulent accounts,  and shady deals.
 You made quite the catch.
 It's all thanks to you three.
 Sir, did you happen to take on this mission  because you knew this would happen?
 We mustn't allow any evil deeds  to be done in the Clover Kingdom.
 Yes, sir.
 Klaus, Yuno, and Mimosa, I look forward  to all of your future great deeds.
 Yes, sir.
 Yuno and Mimosa...
 It appears that the newbies this year are...  well, at least slightly competent.
 I'm counting on you all.  Especially you, Yuno.
 So, a star...
 Everything ended well this time, but don't  ever act on your own again, Yuno.
 Yes, sir.
 Why was there a pause? Yuno, look at me!
 Look me in the eyes and say that  you won't act on your own again.
 Yes, sir.
 Yuno! Hey, Yuno!
 What?! The Golden Dawn received a star?!
 We are hoomans.
 And I thought we were finally only  100 away. Now we're 101 away again.
 Damn it! I thought we'd  finally caught up to them!
 So close.
 How is that close? We're at minus 30.
 We are hoomans.
 Shut up!
 I'm not going to lose!
 They're only ahead by 101!  I'll catch up in no time!
 Just you wait, Golden Dawn!
 Yuno!
 Sir, there's trouble. An anomaly—
 An anomaly has occurred, right?
 Well... Let's have them work on this mission.
 Them?
 No one can escape from here
 Once again in the small closed off classroom
 The star of the class was shining yet again
 They shine so bright that I close my eyes
 I've thought many times
 That the revolution was within my hands
 Isn't it strange? If you want  to laugh, go ahead and laugh
 The rest of us who were left  behind wanted to become something
 We repeat the same morning over and over
 You're the only one who  can choose your tomorrow
 Let's go beyond our current selves
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 My Steed
 ""My Steed.""
 Well, isn't it beautiful? Its eyes, its beak... Perfection.
 Sure.
 Doesn't it just scream ""Golden Dawn""?
 Sure.
 Whoa, that's so cool! What is that?!
 It's as cool as Magna's Crazy Cyclone  and Bah-ha's Shooting Star!
 Isn't it? I have no idea  who you are, but thank you.
 Not a chance.
 What? Explore a dungeon?
 Along with Stupidsta and Luck?
 Leave it to me. Exploring  a dungeon will be easy!

14,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 In a certain world, where magic is everything...
 Asta and Yuno were abandoned  on the same day at
 a church in the village of Hage,  which lies in the boonies.
 They both dreamed of becoming the Wizard  King, the highest rank among mages,
 and worked hard every day.
 In the year they turned fifteen,
 they both received grimoires, which enhance the owner's magical powers.
 They then took the Magic Knights  Entrance Exam to join
 the Magic Knights, which are  led by the Wizard King.
 Let's see who can become the Wizard King!
 As a result, because Yuno possesses  immense magical powers,
 out of the nine squads, he chose  the elite Golden Dawn to join.
 As for Asta, who had no magical powers,
 he ended up joining the squad  of rogues, the Black Bulls.
 I'm still going to become  the Wizard King someday!
 Thus the two finally took the first step  toward becoming the Wizard King.
 Wh-What's going on?
 Wh-What the heck is this?!
 Sir, there's trouble. An anomaly—
 An anomaly has occurred, right?
 Well... Let's have them work on this mission.
 Them?
 I would always close my eyes
 And cower at reality
 I can't stand the idea
 Of just making excuses to give up
 Stand right there
 I don't want to be near you
 Any minute now
 Just wait right there
 (The decisive battle is still a long way off)
 Black and blue
 I'll give up on giving up
 And get the world on my side
 I'm looking for the reason I'm alive
 Every time somewhere under this sky
 Break through the tearful nights
 And head where the light shines
 I want to keep my promise
 I'll deliver it to you

 Hey, Magna. Let's fight. No holding back.
 Nine hundred eighty-two...
 Nine hundred eighty-three...
 No way, you battle-obsessed freak.
 Nine hundred eighty-four...
 Oh, come on. Let's do it.
 Nine hundred eighty-five...
 I'm gonna eat your pudding.
 Nine hundred eighty-six...
 If you do that, I'll—
 Nine hundred eighty-seven...
 Will you fight me?!
 Will you?!
 No.
 Nine hundred eighty-eight...
 Aw...
 Nine hundred eighty-nine...
 Silvantus Schnauzer.
 Nine hundred ninety...
 I think something else would be better.

 Let's see... Like ""Wine""!
 Nine hundred ninety-two...
 Nine hundred ninety-three...
 Wine?
 Nine hundred ninety-four...
 I will allow you to borrow a single letter
 Nine hundred ninety-five...
 from the name of my little sister, the goddess Marie.
 Nine hundred ninety-six...
 I will let you take the ""M."" Be grateful.
 Nine hundred ninety-seven...
 Make it something cooler!
 Nine hundred ninety-eight...
 Like, let's see...
 Nine hundred ninety-nine...
 Magnam Fire!
 One thousand...
 Lame.
 One thousand and one...
 You have no taste, Lady Noe.
 More like you don't.
 One thousand and two...
 Thinking of names looks like fun.
 One thousand and three...
 I thought of one, too. I wonder if  they'll ask. I think it's a good name.
 One thousand and four...
 Munchy, munchy, munchy...
 One thousand and five...
 Can I fatten that bird up?  He looks really yummy.
 One thousand and six...
 One thousand and seven...
 Absolutely not!
 One thousand and eight...
 Does he lay eggs?
 Huh?
 Definitely Toritaro!
 No, it's Silvantus Schnauzer.
 Toritaro!
 Silvantus Schnauzer!
 Toritaro!
 Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
 The heck was that for, Toritaro?!
 There, you see?
 You prefer Silvantus Schnauzer, don't you?
 Right? Right?
 Magnam Fire!
 ""M.""
 Wine!
 Why not Nero?
 What?!
 Looks like he approves.
 ""Nero"" means ""black.""
 Nero?
 All right, listen up.
 Mister Yami! Hello!
 We're back, everyone.
 Welcome back.
 What did they want at the castle?
 If it's a mission, I want  to go with everyone, too.
 Mission? Is it a mission?
 I have an announcement for you all.
 A new dungeon has been discovered.
 A dungeon?!
 Are you serious, Mister Yami?!
 What the heck is a dungeon?!
 Huh?
 Are you serious? You were surprised,  and you didn't even know what it is?
 I just went with the flow!
 Talk about predictable!
 Listen up. Dungeons are...
 Kind of like ancient tombs that contain relics made by the people from back then.
 Sometimes they have info  about powerful ancient magic
 or super rare magical items.
 They're absolutely amazing!
 But you know...
 The people back then set  insane magical traps in them
 so that they wouldn't get misused by anyone.
 They're super dangerous and really fun!
 The Magic Knights always investigate them since they're so dangerous,
 and to make sure none of  the treasures get stolen.
 Oh, okay!
 I see.
 Which means the Black Bulls are  supposed to investigate this
 newly discovered dungeon?
 Yes.
 Clover Kingdom
 Particularly because this dungeon  popped up near our enemy's border.
 Dungeon
 Enemy?
 Diamond Kingdom
 The Diamond Kingdom.
 We need to take care of this mission fast  so Diamond's people won't steal anything.
 By the way, there have been instances  in which someone found a magical item
 that could change civilization itself in a dungeon,
 and someone even learned how  to use the ultimate magic there.
 Me! Me! Please let me go!
 I might be able to use  the ultimate magic, too!
 You don't have any magic,  so that's not happening.
 You never know!
 Actually, you can go, kid.
 In fact, the Wizard King chose you himself.
 Huh?
 Huh?!
 The Wizard King?! Why?!
 That's awesome, Asta!
 What the heck? Did you bump  into the Wizard King somewhere?
 No, never!
 The Wizard King chose me!
 I don't know why, but...
 Great Wizard King!
 Asta the Unworthy will give his all on this mission!
 Noelle, you're also going with him.
 Huh?
 Everything counts as experience.
 Oh, and Luck.
 You're the leader.
 I'm leaving those two to you.
 Really?
 Yup.
 You'll lose your touch if you  stay cooped up all the time.
 Yay!
 Listen up. Make sure you  look after the newbies.
 Leave it to me!
 I want to go, too. I wish  they'd take me with them.
 Be careful.
 Asta! Lady Noe! Give it your all!
 Got it!
 I guess I don't have a choice.
 I think I'll go find some cute girls, then.
 Huh?
 May I go see my sister?
 If you're prepared to die.
 The sunset is beautiful from here.
 I recommend this location for dates.
 I'll have some nummies ready  for you when you get back!
 We're counting on you.
 Got it.
 Okay!
 Let's see... It's this way.
 They could've just dropped us off  right in front of the dungeon.
 Finral's only able to go to  places he's been to before.
 But thankfully, it was  still near the dungeon.
 Let's go!
 Why the heck did you come?
 I wonder how the Wizard  King even knew about Asta.
 That guy...
 is able to see things we can't.
 He's also a weirdo.
 It's so dark.
 Don't cling to me. It's hard to walk.
 Wh-Who's clinging?
 I can't see anything!
 Ow...
 Hey, could you not step on my foot?
 I can't help it! It's pitch black in here!
 Stop being so pissy.
 It's all because you broke the lamp!
 Honestly, you have some nerve.
 It's your fault for tripping  and running into me!
 How dare you? I'm royalty!
 So what?!
 Insect.
 Is this it?
 W-Wow!
 What the heck's going on with this place?
 What is this?
 Looks like the space is  warped because of magic.
 There's even stronger mana floating  around here than outside.
 Yes. I've never been anywhere  this full of mana before.
 Really?
 Are you saying you can't feel all this mana?
 Not at all.
 Amazing. I guess people who don't  have magic really are different.
 Shut up!
 I want to feel mana, too!
 I want mana!
 Must be nice being one of you royals!
 You have a ridiculous amount of mana!
 In my body, I don't have even an ounce
 of the foundation of magic... Mana!
 God damn!
 Huh?
 T-Trap magic?
 That was dangerous. Be more careful.
 My bad.
 Here it is, Asta.
 This.
 Where?
 Hup.
 What was that for?!
 That was amazing!
 Listen, you!
 Oh, there's another one.
 Hup!
 Whee!
 And another one!
 This is so much fun!
 Isn't this exciting?
 We're going to die if we stay with this guy.
 I wonder if those kids are okay.
 The more dangerous the mission, the more  newbies will surpass their limits and grow.
 I think.
 You think?
 Well, Luck's with them,  so they should be fine.
 His ability to detect mana is off the charts. It's even greater than a noble's.
 If his personality wasn't so messed up,  any other squad would've taken him.
 I think it's that personality  we're worried about.
 Yeah.
 Man... Your anti-magic weapon is amazing.
 I wonder if that's why the  Wizard King chose you.
 I'd love to fight you for real  in about two to three years!
 If you're prepared to keep swinging  your sword around like that,
 this dungeon won't be any problem.
 Got it!
 Now, then...
 I think I'm about to reach my limit.
 I knew it.
 There are others here.
 The strongest looking one is...
 Lightning Creation Magic:
 Holy Lightning Boots.
 Something important just came up.
 So I'm leaving the dungeon  exploration to you guys!
 Hey, where are you—
 Wh-What in the world is he thinking?!
 S-So cool!
 This is insane!
 Left turn next...
 I can't wait to see how  strong this person is!
 Honestly... He's unbelievable.
 Captain Yami clearly told him to  keep an eye on us, and he just left!
 Don't worry.
 No matter what kind of traps might spring up, I'll slice through them with my sword.
 Must be nice being as carefree as you.
 This dungeon ain't nothin'!
 I'm going to become the  Wizard King, after all.
 Again with that?
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King before Yuno.
 Yuno?
 Yeah. I haven't told you about him before?
 He's a childhood friend I grew up with in Hage Village.
 We took the Magic Knights  Entrance Exam together,
 and he got into the Golden Dawn.
 That's amazing, isn't it?
 He got into the Golden Dawn  without being a noble.
 Yeah! He's amazing!
 But I'm not gonna lose to him!
 I guess even he has his own goal.
 Come on. Let's go.
 Looks like we can cross over there.
 Let's hurry!
 We're alone right now.
 Silvantus... I mean, Nero's with us, but...
 Something wrong?
 It's nothing! Nothing at all!
 Let's hurry.
 A trap! Oh, no!
 Noelle!
 S-Such powerful magic...
 Run!
 Asta!
 Oh, no!
 Crap!
 What the heck?
 Such precise and powerful magic...
 Who could it be?
 Oh, come to think of it...
 Apparently, a few from the Golden Dawn  have also been assigned to that dungeon.
 Huh? The Golden Dawn?!
 I wonder if they'll be able to get along.
 Now...
 I've repaid my debt,
 Asta.
 Yuno...
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward
 (I can't find a place to go)
 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time
 (I will keep believing in you)
 In this ever-vivid place
 (Break free yourself)
 In order to grasp my endless dream
 If there is a path that I should choose
 (Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
 Wherever it may lead us
 Until my life comes to an end
 I will accept any pain that comes my way
 (We can try again, we can try again)
 Even if we can't see tomorrow
 Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
 I'll keep screaming them in my heart
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 What's Mana?
 What's Mana?
 Asta, do you know what mana is?
 Yup!
 Mana
 It's written like this!
 Mana
 It's written with the same  character for ""magic""!
 Serious
 These both mean ""serious""!
 Yes. Mana is a powerful energy  that exists in this world.
 Yup! And everyone has it...
 Except me!
 Mages use up their mana to use magic.
 That's why if they run out of it,
 they might not be able to use  magic again until they recover.
 Do you understand?
 Yes!
 What a lovely flower!
 Perfect for giving to a girl.
 Finral!
 Wow, you're so aggressive!
 I've never met a flower like you!
 You've got really powerful magic, mister.
 Let's fight with everything  we have, to the death.

 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 A new dungeon was discovered on  the border of the Clover Kingdom.
 Asta, Noelle, and Luck of the Black  Bulls were assigned to investigate it.

 Captain Vangeance!
 What is it?
 Sir, about the exploration  of the new dungeon...
 Why did you send that new peasant  recruit on such an important mission?
 Do you trust me?
 Of course.
 I, Alecdora Sandler, am ready to die for you.
 In that case, I'd like you to trust  him, too. Because I trust him.
 He's also a member of the Golden Dawn.
 I'm sure he'll become an even  more powerful force for us.
 Yes, sir.
 Yes... We need him to get stronger.
 So he's Yuno? And that's...
 Yuno,
 why did you bother saving them?
 Our only mission is to explore this dungeon...
 In other words, to quickly reach the  treasure chamber buried deep below.
 We don't have any time  to waste on these fools.
 Hey, Yuno. What's the deal  with this rude four-eyed dude?
 He's my senior.
 Four—
 You're the rude one!
 I'm a four... er, I'm a nobleman!  How dare you address me so casually?!
 He's flustered all of a sudden.
 Member of the Golden Dawn Mimosa Vermillion
 Good day, Noelle.
 I don't think I've seen you since  the royal banquet last year.
 You know her?
 Yes... Somewhat.
 I'm Noelle's cousin.
 Huh...
 So, you're here, too.
 It just had to be her...
 I've heard the Black Bulls are a very  barbaric squad. Have you been faring well?
 And are you doing okay, Mimosa?
 Huh?
 I'm not sure someone as dense as you  can make it in the Golden Dawn.
 Yes! Everyone is so kind.
 Because of that, I've been able to  use my magic without hesitation.
 If I remember correctly, you weren't  able to control your magic at all.
 Have things improved since then?
 She's as obliviously rude as ever.  She still pisses me off.
 I-I've been working on it.
 Oh, the three of us recently received  a star from the Wizard King himself
 for another mission.
 Hmph.
 We just got a star, too!
 Hmph.
 You liars.
 Newbies from the Black Bulls wouldn't  be awarded stars so easily.
 We did get one! We're at minus thirty now!
 It's laughable that you've been  charged with this mission, too.
 The Wizard King appointed  us to this mission himself!
 Such a blatant lie.
 I'm not lying!
 Hmph.
 He really is flustered.
 Come to think of it, I heard  there'd be three of you, too.
 Where's the other one?
 Don't tell me they left you two and ran.
 Or did they fall prey to one of the traps?
 He didn't run away, nor did he  fall prey to any of the traps.
 Then where is he?
 Just a little more!
 There's no way we can tell them he  ditched us and went off somewhere.
 Nope.
 Regardless, it's clear your lot consists  of filth that leaves new recruits behind.
 The Black Bulls... How unsightly.
 You're an embarrassment to the Magic Knights.
 You've got some nerve, you jerk!
 We're going to conquer this  dungeon first for the Black Bulls!
 Just you wait, Gol... No, Goober?
 No, uh... you guys with the  weird masked captain!
 Goober? It's Golden!
 And ""weird mask""? You scum!
 You dare mock our esteemed  Captain Vangeance?!
 You're the ones with a weird captain!
 What kind of freak runs around with all  those muscles bulging out of a tank top?!
 What'd you say?! He's manly and totally awesome!
 How dare you talk to a noble like that?! Not to mention your senior!
 Well, excuse me! My bad!
 You bastard!
 Yeah, he's really flustered.
 Very well, you fools!
 We'll just have to show you the difference  between the top of the Magic Knights
 and the bottom!
 Mimosa!
 Sure.
 Plant Creation Magic: Magic Flower Guidepost.
 Let's see... Ah, got it.
 I've learned the basic layout of the dungeon.
 Very well. Yuno!
 Right.
 He can carry all three of them so easily.
 I hope you suffer.
 Impressive as always, Yuno!
 All right! Let's go, Noelle!
 Hey!
 Let's see which of us gets to  the treasure chamber first!
 And what are we supposed to do?
 Neither of us can use tracking spells!
 We'll just have to check  every path very carefully!
 I'm gonna do this!
 Are you stupid? Oh, right, you are.
 At this rate, we'll get lost before  we even find the treasure chamber!
 Nero?
 Take the next right.
 Okay.
 What was that fool's name? Asta? The nerve.
 There's no way he can beat us.
 What's with him, anyway? I couldn't  sense any magic from him.
 You're right.
 What was the captain  of the Black Bulls thinking,
 taking someone like him—
 Klaus.
 It's best that you don't underestimate him.
 They'll do well enough to get  out of this dungeon alive.
 I'm just trying to conquer this dungeon as  fast as possible, for our country's sake.
 I have a report for the Wizard King.
 The two Magic Knight Squads, the Golden Dawn and the Black Bulls,
 have begun their investigations  of the dungeon.
 We have also confirmed that a military mage  squad from the Diamond Kingdom is there.
 Our neighbor, the Diamond Kingdom...
 They've been trying to expand  their borders lately.
 Clover Kingdom
 Dungeon
 Diamond Kingdom
 They're an aggressive kingdom.
 There'll be trouble if we let  them steal the ancient magic
 that might be in the dungeon.
 Who's in charge of this  invasion from Diamond?
 Yes, sir. The one leading the  enemy squad is Lotus of the Abyss.
 Lotus?!
 Ah... I've met him on the battlefield before.
 He was pretty strong!
 The magic he used was really interesting.
 Sir, should you sound so amused right now? Shouldn't you be more concerned?
 Don't worry, it's fine. I hear Yami's  sent an interesting one on this mission.
 But...
 Lotus is strong, but our  kids are strong, too.
 Huh?
 You're so weak.
 But I'm sure you're different.
 Well, this isn't good.
 Nothing good comes of  raising hurdles too high.
 Enthusiastic young power...
 Terrifying, really.
 Lotus of the Abyss
 You took my subordinates out in an instant.
 You're pretty strong.
 Well, they are just subordinates.
 But if you're their boss and you're  strong, there's no problem.
 So you fight wrapped in  your own lightning magic.
 Not only is that practical,  but you seem pretty powerful.
 And you're fast.
 You're making the most  of your youthful strength.
 You've got this old man shaking in his boots.
 What kind of magic do you fight with?
 You seem rather enthusiastic.
 You Clover people are also after this  dungeon's treasure chamber, aren't you?
 Come on, let's fight!
 Good grief.
 Actually, I'm pretty sure  we don't have to fight.
 Let's just compete nonviolently!
 Yeah, great idea. Bye!
 Nope!
 You sure are fast.
 He dodged me?
 Smoke?
 Goodness, that was scary.
 I can see why the citizens of  the Clover Kingdom would be mad.
 I mean, we've been trying  to invade here and there.
 I apologize for all the trouble the  Diamond Kingdom's been causing you.
 But you see, our kingdom's running out  of resources, so we have it rough, too.
 If we want to survive, we don't really have a choice.
 Living can be so hard.
 You see, I have three daughters...
 Oh, is that so?!
 Whatever! I don't care as long  as I get to fight strong people.
 Looks like I've caught the  eye of some real trouble.
 This old man might just cry.
 What is this place? The gravity's all messed up!
 Are you sure we're going the right way?
 Hey, Nero!
 Don't fall asleep!
 Hey, treasure!
 Yeah, that's definitely not treasure.
 Come on, Stupidsta! That has to be a trap!
 All right! I got it!
 Hey, stop that!
 I wonder what's inside!  I wonder what's inside!
 I told you to stop! What are you  going to do if it's a trap?
 Open!
 Wh-Why did you have to  show me that, Shrimpsta?!
 It's not my faul—
 You're so full of life.
 Stop dodging, and let's fight!
 Please? Come on!
 Oh, now I remember. The Black Bulls.
 I've fought with your captain before.
 He was pretty hot-headed, too.
 What? You know the captain?
 How could I forget?
 He gave me this lovely scar.
 I pissed my pants and ran.
 Goodness, that was scary.
 He had a very unusual fighting style.
 He was the only younger opponent  I've had that I couldn't defeat.
 That makes you even more worth figh—
 Wh-Whoa, there...
 Oh?
 What's the matter?
 It's... nothing!
 So slow!
 Little by little, fall right into the abyss.
 What is this? Magic? But I don't  remember getting hit by his magic...
 You see, this whole room  is enveloped in my magic.
 Very thin smoke that you can't really see.
 It's called Weakening Smoke Magic: Garden of Plundering Smoke, if you were wondering.
 My body's not listening to me.
 A spell that lowers physical  abilities? When did he...
 I had a feeling you'd block it  if it were a visible attack.
 I lowered my magical  ability as much as I could
 so I could use this without you noticing...
 While you were fighting my subordinates.
 They didn't go out in vain.
 They sacrificed themselves  so I could use this spell.
 It's very important, isn't it?
 Teamwork.
 We're almost there. Once we get through this tunnel...
 How amazing!
 That's all there is to dungeons?  That wasn't very difficult.
 I wonder how you get in.
 It appears the Black Bulls aren't here yet.
 Of course not. There's no way they'd beat us.
 Indeed.
 Mimosa!
 It ripped through her  magic-shielding cloak...
 She's an expert at sensing mana, but she didn't notice?
 You're alive, aren't you?
 That wasn't a trap spell...  What is this magic?
 Who are you?!
 Who stands in my way?
 Move.
 Friends you can trust are  worth their weight in gold.
 Sorry, but stay there a while and get weaker.
 Win...
 Win...
 Keep winning, Luck!
 Wait.
 It's been a while
 since things actually got interesting.
 More... More!
 Let's fight some more!
 I'd rather not pluck a bud  that's still so young...
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward
 (I can't find a place to go)
 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time
 (I will keep believing in you)
 In this ever-vivid place
 (Break free yourself)
 In order to grasp my endless dream
 If there is a path that I should choose
 (Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
 Wherever it may lead us
 Until my life comes to an end
 I will accept any pain that comes my way
 (We can try again, we can try again)
 Even if we can't see tomorrow
 Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
 I'll keep screaming them in my heart

 Petit Clover!
 A Lotus Flower That Doesn't Bloom Is Just a Lotus
 A Lotus Flower That Doesn't  Bloom Is Just a Lotus.
 You see, I have three daughters...
 ""When I get older, I'm going to marry you, Daddy!""
 And all three of them fight over me.
 But once they hit puberty...
 ""Get away from me!""
 ""Don't mix my laundry with yours!""
 I'm sure they'll say things like that.
 And my wife was so nice when  we first met, but now...
 This is really annoying, so I think I'm  ready to fall into the abyss now.
 We're not done yet. It's finally getting fun.
 More! Let's play more!
 Let's kill each other! Please, Mister?

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Yuno, we're family, right?
 Yeah.
 But we don't share the same blood.
 Yeah.
 But we're more connected than people who share the same blood.

 Friends
 Luck!
 Why can't you do something so simple?
 How many times must I tell you?
 Why are you smiling like that?
 Why can't you cry or get angry?
 Why were you born that way?!
 H-Hey...
 You're kidding, right?
 One of the common students defeated a noble...
 That's never happened before in our  school's magic exchange competition.
 It's not normal for a  commoner to beat a noble.
 Crap, I was picking on him.  He might try to get me back.
 He's always smiling... He's super creepy.
 Don't get involved with him.  He'll beat you to a pulp.
 You won against a noble using magic?
 That's amazing, Luck!
 I had no idea you had such powers!
 Normally, no one can beat a noble.
 You must be special!
 Keep winning.
 Win, win, and keep on  winning with your powers.
 No one will help you in this world.
 You must use your own powers.
 If that will make you happy, Mother.
 Win...
 So dangerous.
 You've become faster and sharper.
 Win...
 I'll keep winning!
 With my powers!
 Sorry, but I can't afford to lose, either.
 Smoke Creation Magic: Binding Cross Prison.
 Solid smoke? I can't move.
 This uses up a lot of magic, so I really didn't want to use it.
 I'm out of gas.
 You won't be able to zip around anymore, kid.
 Now, then... I wonder how our kid is doing.
 Ouchie!
 He's not very good at communicating...
 Maybe it's the generation gap?
 Plant Recovery Magic:
 Dream-Healing Flower Cradle.
 I'm so sorry... I'm supposed to be  the healer, and I went down first.
 Don't think about unnecessary things. Right now, concentrate on healing yourself.
 That crest... Is he one of the invading mages from the Diamond Kingdom?
 You scoundrel!
 You dare attack someone from behind?  Is that something a warrior should do?
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 What?
 You're all the same. Just pebbles by the wayside.
 Back me up, Yuno!
 Right.
 You Diamond scum! I'll show you the  true power of Clover's Golden Dawn!
 All right! This path is a cinch to go down!
 The mana is getting denser.
 Is the treasure chamber really this way?
 Whoa... What's wrong?
 This magic is probably Luck's.  I think he's fighting.
 Seriously?
 I wonder if that means the  enemy really did invade.
 The enemy? We have to go help him out!
 But...
 Maybe it's better to just  leave the fighting to Luck.
 If the enemy really got in, I'm sure  they're after the treasure chamber.
 It might be better to head over there first.
 We need to take care of this mission fast  so Diamond's people won't steal anything.
 At this rate, the Golden Dawn  will get ahead of us, too.
 Win... I have to keep  winning with my powers...
 Looks like there's something tying you down.
 What I want... is going away...
 Huh? What was the thing I wanted?
 He's using such powerful  attacks without a grimoire.
 Not only that, it doesn't appear  that he's losing any magic.
 If this goes on...
 Yuno! You head to the treasure  chamber while I'm fighting him!
 He's strong. If you fight him  without support, even you won't...
 Just hurry up and go!
 Frankly, I'd rather not leave  this to a peasant like you!
 But it's for our kingdom! Fulfill our duty!
 That's right, you fool.
 Curses!
 I'll set you free...
 Yuno, we're family, right?
 But we're more connected than people who share the same blood.
 Looks like we've got another lively one.
 What brought this on?
 Why did you come back?!
 I'm saying...
 And who might you be?
 I'm...
 We don't have any blood relatives,
 but all of the friends we've made...
 You should be concentrating on the mission!
 And all the friends we're going to make...
 Let's treat them just like they're family.
 No...
 ...his friend!
 We're friends!
 Yuno! You head to the treasure  chamber while I'm fighting him!
 That's right, you fool.
 Curses!
 I'll set you free...
 Why did you come back, you fool?!
 You need to hurry up and  get to the treasure chamber,
 for the sake of the Clover Kingdom!
 Let's defeat him and go together.
 All three of us!
 Now you're gonna have to face us, old man!
 Oh, dear... Having your friends show  up is definitely not in my favor.
 Apparently, she just suddenly dropped dead.
 She always seemed to be  under a lot of stress.
 And now her kid's all alone... How awful.
 Well, I'm not so sure.  Her kid's sort of weird.
 Despite the fact that his mother just died...
 He's...
 Luck?
 He's my prey.
 Win...
 I'm going to win and keep offering  those victories to my mom.
 I'll take care of him myself.
 I don't need any friends. Just my powers...
 Hey, what are you—
 Otherwise, Mom won't accept me.
 Have it your way.
 Hey!
 Guess I shouldn't be holding back anymore.
 I... I... I need to...
 make Mom accept me...
 or I'll be all alone!
 Do whatever you want!  And I'll do what I want!
 I'll do this alone...
 I won't leave you alone!
 Not yet!
 Some part of me...
 I don't care what you think about me!
 Do whatever you want!
 ...was trying not to realize...
 I've already acknowledged  you as my... as our friend!
 ...that I had friends I could rely on.
 I'm sorry, Mom. I...
 wasn't alone.
 True, it seems like it'd be more  fun if we all fought together.
 Yeah!
 Well, this isn't good at all.
 You're going to make an old man get serious.
 Smoke Creation Magic:  Prison of the Fallen King.
 You won't be able to get away anymore, kids.
 No matter who we're facing,
 we, the Black Bulls, will win!
 I'm going to get serious now.
 What are you...
 Wind Creation Magic: Swift White Hawk and Wind Blade Shower.
 Simultaneous spell activation?!
 And this power... H-He's...
 It will be the Golden Dawn that  reaches the treasure chamber first!
 Take that!
 I cut and cut, but there's  no end! It keeps coming back!
 I'm getting dizzy...
 The smoke just keeps getting thicker.
 At this rate, we're going to suffocate.
 This isn't good. We have to  hurry up and defeat that mage.
 I can pretty much tell  where he is with my magic,
 but he'll probably dodge, even if I attack.
 Thinking back on our battle so far,
 he's able to travel at high  speed within the smoke.
 And his ability to sense magic is high.
 If we're to land a hit on him, we'll have to surprise him.
 But how do we do that without  him noticing our magic?
 The downside of this magic is  that it drains my powers a lot.
 My magic level is still fine, though.
 Well, that and the fact that I can't see the enemy.
 But that's no problem.
 Because I can sense your magic just fine.
 Whoa, there!
 Wow, a barrage. Are you getting desperate?
 That's not going to hit me  or get rid of the smoke.
 You're just wasting magic.
 I think the difference in our  experience levels is starting to show.
 After all, I've fought far more mages than you have.
 Huh?
 I chased him over.
 And I suppressed my magic so  he wouldn't notice, and then...
 Go!
 He can't sense Asta, so Asta attacked.
 It went well.
 I guess teamwork really is important.
 H-How can this be?
 Begone.

 Oh, my...
 So you decided that you would treat all of  the friends you encountered like family.
 That's so wonderful.
 Yeah.
 Family... So basically, it's like this...
 Big Brother Klaus!
 That tickles!
 Little Brother, allow me  to bestow these upon you.
 Yay, glasses!
 Thanks, Big Brother!
 Not a chance...
 He's strong...
 But if I'm going to become the Wizard King,  I can't be defeated here.

 Pretty sure he got some of my ribs, too.
 I won't be able to fight anymore.
 There sure are some oddballs  in the Clover Kingdom.

 I can safely say that even I've never met  someone with no magic on the battlefield.

 are way too fast.

 We need to hurry to the treasure chamber.

 Diamond Kingdom Mage Warrior Mars
 He's the Diamond Kingdom's  secret weapon, after all.
 Such ominous magic...
 Yuno's at full strength,  and even he stands no chance...
 Those stones embedded in his forehead...
 I've heard of them before.
 There's a rumor that the Diamond  Kingdom is raising mage warriors
 with artificially amplified magic.
 They choose young children  with powerful magical abilities,
 put them in fierce competition  with each other,
 embed magical items that amplify  their powers into their bodies...
 And finally, they have them  fight one another to the death.
 The last survivor of that death match...
 is him?
 No matter who the opponent is...  Is this really acceptable?
 What is happening here?
 I'm a noble!
 A member of the Golden Dawn!
 I let my comrade get hurt so easily.
 I'm being protected by my  subordinate, who's a peasant.

 I finally catch up with you, and look at you! What the hell are you doing, Yuno?! Damn it!
 Who said you could get your ass kicked?
 Why'd you get in my way?
 I almost had him.
 Liar! You're all beat up!
 You were about to die!
 I was just about to unleash  a ferocious counterattack.
 You're such a liar!
 I was about to do it.
 You're always like this!
 Did you come to get in my way?
 What?!
 You can go home now.
 Fine, then.
 Let's see who can take this guy down first!
 Wh-What's going on?
 We, the Golden Dawn, didn't stand a  chance against his magic, and yet...
 That peasant from the Black Bulls...
 Oh, no!
 Weak.
 He's...
 The one who made trouble at  the Entrance Exam by beating
 his opponent far worse than necessary!
 Luck the Cheery Berserker!
 This was the other member of  the Black Bulls that was here?
 How could I end up being  saved by the Black Bulls?!
 Mimosa!
 Well, this is embarrassing...
 Just as you said, I'm a bit slow.
 Yes.
 You've always been like that.
 That's why...
 I'm going to protect you.
 Noelle...
 Are you the one who beat up the Golden Dawn?
 What if I am?
 The weak will perish,  and only the strong will remain.
 That's all that matters.
 He summoned so many at once!
 There is no reason for the weak  to stand on the battlefield.
 I was born to break people like you.
 Oh, really?
 Then go ahead...
 and try to break me!
 I intend to.
 He's so strong!
 Aw, man...
 I wanted to be the one to fight him!
 Impossible...
 How could a peasant that I can't feel  a shred of mana from do all this?
 All you've been doing is whining.
 Negating magic...
 That's Asta's power.
 Negating magic?
 How can he have a power so unfit for a peasant?!
 So he just got lucky and  ended up with this power.
 Just watch him, and you'll  find out if it's just luck or not.
 Hey, come on! Are you  finished already, you jerk?
 Asta!
 What...
 are you?
 I'm someone who was born without any magic!
 He doesn't have any magic?!
 So it really was just luck—
 But even so, I'm going to  become the Wizard King!
 And I'm alive...
 to prove that!
 What is going on with his body?  How much has he trained?!
 The Wizard King? Does he truly...
 Mars!
 What do you want to be when you grow up?
 I'm...
 I'm just going to destroy everything!
 Destroy everything?
 The Wizard King protects everyone!
 We were born to protect  everyone in this country.
 Like hell I'm going to lose  to someone like you!
 You're in my way...
 Begone, pebble!
 I may be just a pebble,
 but I'm...
 a pebble that shatters diamonds!

 That should do it.
 Is this actually going  to keep him restrained?
 Of course it is!
 My magic is not so weak that it'd  be broken by someone who's injured.
 Look! We've taken his grimoire, too.
 Don't get so pissy.
 Want some medicinal herbs?
 I don't want your leftovers!
 What about you, Yuno?
 Not a chance.
 I'm glad that you're all safe.
 Should you be moving around now?
 It's fine. I feel much better.
 It's all because you protected me, Noelle.
 I-I didn't protect you.
 You're just so helpless that  I couldn't leave you alone.
 Right. Thank you very much.
 M-More importantly, Asta,  do something about your clothes!
 Well, what am I supposed to do?
 Aren't you embarrassed?
 Why are you the one turning red?
 I'm not turning red!
 Actually...
 My robe's ripped to shreds...
 Magna's gonna kill me.
 Vanessa will fix it for you when we get back.
 Well, that's good, I guess.
 To think that we'd be saved  by the Black Bulls...
 We were the first ones to arrive,  therefore we win this competition,
 but I will allow you three to enter  the treasure chamber, also.
 Why do you always sound  so arrogant, four-eyes?
 Well, thank you very much, you jerk!

 I-Impossible!
 My restraining magic...  And in so little time...
 How could he have revived?!
 Th-That's...
 Flame recovery magic? That's impossible!
 Everyone should have only  one magical attribute!
 Mages have mana from the four classical  elements: fire, wind, water, and earth.
 Fire
 Wind
 Water
 Earth
 Fire is strong against wind,  and weak against water.
 There are compatibilities  between each element.
 Mages can only use magic  from their own mana or
 from a single attribute derived from it.
 He's breaking all of those laws to have  two different kinds of magic!
 Not to mention, he was clearly  a user of offensive magic,
 but now he's using recovery magic!
 That's inconceivable!
 Are these the results of the  Diamond Kingdom's experiments?!
 I'm sure you'll become a great warrior, Mars.
 I'm sorry, Mars.
 I have no other choice.
 Please die.
 I'll put that fire out!
 Noelle!
 Noelle!
 Noelle!
 You bastard!
 How dare you do that to my friend?!
 I know your abilities now.
 If that blade is able to cut  through various magics,
 then what about magic that's  faster than your blade?
 So fast!
 How dare you do that to my friend?!
 Mars!
 The strong will survive,  and the weak will die.
 Noelle!
 The strong will survive...
 Noelle!
 Hey, you idiot! Get a hold of yourself!
 The Dream-Healing Flower  Cradle won't be fast enough!
 Plant Recovery Magic:  Princess-Healing Flower Robe!
 Noelle...
 This is the strongest  spell I can use right now.
 Please don't die,
 Noelle!
 Ow...
 What are you doing, Mimosa?
 Honestly, you're so slow.
 Here.
 Thanks, Noelle.
 That's amazing, Mimosa!
 Who knew you'd be able to use  recovery magic that's this powerful?
 With your royal magic, you may become  a healer who can heal any injury.
 This is exciting.
 On the other hand...
 There's the House of Silva's second daughter, who can't even control her powers.
 I hear she's training every day.
 Who knew someone like that  would be born into royalty?
 I guess we Vermillions are the true royalty.
 I might've just given up  if I were in her shoes...
 Royals mock hard work.
 It's something only those who  aren't born into power do,
 not something that royalty does.
 But...
 I admire you for the hard work you do.
 The strong will survive,  and the weak will die.
 The strong will survive,  and the weak will die.
 If only I could use my grimoire...
 My sword...
 Noelle... Mimosa...
 With my big, heavy sword, I won't be able to beat his magic's speed.
 He changed the way he fights, and the magic he uses while doing it.
 What am I supposed to...
 Nero?
 Please die.
 The strong will survive...
 and the weak...
 Mimosa!
 What is that sword?
 This sword will work.
 Your opponent...
 is me!
 How's that?
 Disappear!
 Even if I can cut through his attack magic,  as long as he has that recovery magic,
 I won't be able to finish him off!
 What should I do?
 What are you doing, Stupidsta?
 Noelle!
 Noelle...
 You're the first peasant...
 that I, a royal, ever acknowledged.
 Hurry up and
 defeat that guy, Asta!
 Yeah, leave it to me.
 I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!
 Move. I'm going to make that girl,  that weakling, disappear!
 Like hell I'll let that happen!
 I don't have any magic,
 but I've got...
 my friends!
 This is nothing!
 Wh-What just happened? He's not  supposed to have any magic!
 A water magic attack?
 He borrowed Noelle's powers?
 What in the world is that sword?
 I don't really get it, but I did it!
 I messed up...
 Asta...
 Asta!
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward
 (I can't find a place to go)
 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time
 (I will keep believing in you)
 In this ever-vivid place
 (Break free yourself)
 In order to grasp my endless dream
 If there is a path that I should choose
 (Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
 Wherever it may lead us
 Until my life comes to an end
 I will accept any pain that comes my way
 (We can try again, we can try again)
 Even if we can't see tomorrow
 Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
 I'll keep screaming them in my heart

 Asta!
 Mimosa, I'm fine now, so please  just take care of Asta!
 R-Right!
 I'm not sure if my remaining  magic will be enough.
 Asta!
 Brat! Open your eyes!
 Where's all that energy you just had?!
 You can't die before I kill you!
 Asta!
 Can you hear me, Asta?
 You're not alone!
 Mars, is the training painful?
 When things get rough, remember the faces of those you love.
 We were born to protect the people  of this kingdom that we love so much.
 Once we become strong enough to protect this kingdom, we'll be allowed to go outside.
 You'll probably make it out first, Mars.
 Lucky.
 I mean, you're the strongest  out of all of us, Mars.
 I'll be waiting for you when that happens.
 Huh?
 Until you get out, too, Fana.
 Sure! Let's go see the  outside world together.
 This is your final test.
 Kill each other.
 The sole survivor will be allowed to go  outside as our kingdom's mage warrior.
 If you refuse, you'll all be disposed of.
 I'm sorry, Mars.
 Fana...
 I have no other choice.
 Please die.
 Looks like Mars is the one who survived.
 Then let's implant him with the magic stones.
 Let's go ahead and give him Fana's powers, too, since she was
 the last one he killed.
 Now we'll finally have the  ultimate mage warrior.
 I'm... fine alone,
 because I have extremely powerful magic.
 Those without magic are weak.
 And the weak will die.
 He's...
 ...still moving!
 It can't happen...
 Someone as naïve as you  cannot win against me!
 Asta!
 His flame recovery magic should've  been negated by Asta's attack.
 This is the perfect opportunity  to finish him, but...
 Just a little more... Just a little more,  and I can break through these restraints.
 Die!
 Asta!
 No matter what spell I pick from my grimoire, I won't make it in time.
 I won't let him die here!
 Did Yuno just do that?
 What just happened?
 The spell... has been broken.
 Yuno! What did you do?
 Was that magic? What did you use?
 I'm not sure.
 You're not sure?
 There was a little girl, and...
 A little girl?
 Well...
 You must be tired.
 Let us talk later.
 More importantly,
 we've defeated him for sure this time.
 These are...
 the characters from that scroll.
 Asta...
 What's...
 Is this a trap?
 The dungeon is falling apart!
 Celestial Wind Ark!
 Everyone, get on!
 We're getting out.
 We're ready, Yuno.
 Mimosa, take care of Asta.
 I will.
 Him...
 You shouldn't talk now.
 Save him... please.
 What are you saying?
 He tried to kill us!
 We...
 came to conquer this dungeon.
 Not... to kill...
 an enemy.
 It might be a waste to let  someone that strong die here.
 It's too late! We won't make  it out in time. Let's go!
 Where's the exit?
 Mimosa can't use her  Magic Flower Guidepost right now.
 Go right. I'll guide us out.
 Got it.
 Left.
 Okay.
 Keep going straight.
 Okay.
 I managed to hit it.
 More coming!
 Got it!
 I've already acknowledged  you as my... as our friend!
 We won't let...
 ...Asta die.
 We'll save Asta!
 We'll get out of here...
 ...alive!
 We made it out.
 We did it.
 That was fun!
 Honestly...
 We'll head over there.
 Man... We sure were lucky  they created a path for us.
 Because of this old man's ultimate  trump card, Hermit's Thick Smoke,
 they never realized we were  close by the whole time.
 Anyway, thank goodness you're alive.
 I'm sorry, Mars.
 Fana...
 I have no other choice.
 Please die.
 Why...
 Why?
 My wounds...
 If I didn't do that, you wouldn't have...
 Fana...
 Fana!
 Oh? Are you awake, Mars?
 Lotus...
 Great work back there.
 Thanks to you, I was able  to get all this treasure.
 Now the people of our kingdom,  as well as my daughters,
 will be able to eat delicious things.
 I remember everything.
 Make sure you go see the world outside.
 For me... as well.
 Lotus...
 You saved me. Thank you.
 Well, how about that?
 You can actually say things like that.
 Everyone...

 Asta!
 Hooray.
 Ow...
 Hmph! As long as you're okay, Stupidsta.
 It's unbelievable. Your recuperative ability is amazing.
 He's resilient, if nothing else.
 What'd you say, Yuno?!
 I'm more than just resilient... ow, ow, ow...
 I-I'm so sorry! I didn't have  enough magic to fully heal you.
 I just did what I could for now,  so you probably shouldn't move.
 N-No worries.
 You saved me. Thanks.
 N-No problem at all!
 R-Really...
 I thought you were going to  die before I got to kill you.
 I won't die. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...
 Not until I become the Wizard King.
 Not a chance.
 I'm the one who's going  to be the Wizard King.
 Hup. Ow, ow, ow, ow...
 Don't use my body as a crutch.
 What's the big deal?  It's not like I'm hurting you.
 You two...
 Klaus.
 I'm so...
 sorry!
 I'm so ashamed that I didn't acknowledge  you just because you were peasants!
 Both of you are...
 magnificent Magic Knights  of the Clover Kingdom!
 Klaus...
 Klaus.
 You're suffocating us.
 Lord Four-Eyes... it hurts.
 What?! And after I just...
 Who knew you were such a good four-eyes?
 What do you mean by that, you fool?!
 You're just too serious, Klaus.
 Hey, hey, Yuno!
 Let's fight sometime.
 No.
 Hey, Noelle. Your clothes are all ripped up.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Oh, he died.

 What?!
 I was asleep for a week?
 Honestly, how many days were  you planning on sleeping?
 Noelle was so worried about you  that she kept checking on you.
 I-I wasn't worried...
 I was just wondering what we were  going to do if he didn't wake up.
 Pretty sure that's called being worried.
 Thanks, Noelle.
 I was worried, too. But I'm glad  you all came back safely.
 Getting rest is important, too,
 because that's how much energy you  used up conquering that dungeon.
 But it was a week...
 Stop with this nonsense.
 Do you think that my goddess,
 my sister Marie, would enjoy  listening to all this?
 Talk about something more interesting.
 I only have 3,214 stories stocked up for her.
 When exactly are you going  to tell her all those?
 How are you feeling? Is the hole  in your stomach closed up yet?
 Can you fight me now? Can you?
 It's not completely closed up yet.  In fact, my stomach's so empty, I'm starving...
 Everyone! The Sheep Cooks made breakfast!
 Yum! So good! Delicious!
 Jeez, calm down.
 Thanks...
 You're such a pig.
 Now, now. He needs his nutrients.
 Want a taste?
 No, he can't!
 So good!
 Nice, nice! Your eating form is excellent!
 The Sheep Cooks are delighted, too.
 I think I'll have some  breakfast and go back to bed.
 Captain! Good morning!
 Morning.
 You finally awake, kid?  I guess you didn't die.
 I-I'm alive!
 Good work, even though you  always come back banged up.
 Thanks!
 Oh, yeah. Apparently, Magic Knights Headquarters wants a report on the dungeon,
 so if you can walk, pay them a visit.
 Huh?
 A report?
 The Magic Knights Headquarters?
 La?
 Sounds like there'll be  lots of strong guys there!
 I wonder if I can fight them.
 You'd probably cause trouble if you went, so you're not going, Luck.
 Aw...
 Instead, there's a fighting mission, so go on that with Magna.
 Fighting mission?
 Let's do our best, Magna!
 Huh? Creepy!
 Are you really Luck? Are you sure  you're not Grey in disguise?
 Oh, there he is.
 Ooh, pick me! I'll go instead!
 I wonder what yummy things  await me in the Noble Realm.
 Uh, there's no way you can go.  All you do every day is eat.
 La?!
 La... La!
 Captain, I have to write a  letter to Marie, so I can't go.
 Sure. No one asked you, anyway.
 Can I go—

 This is awesome! It's this huge up close?
 Oh, come on.
 Could you calm down? You're embarrassing me.
 So awesome!
 Hey!
 I'm alone with Asta.
 Wow! It's so huge!
 How long must you keep saying that?
 This is completely normal.
 Oh?
 Well, hello! If it isn't the members  of the Golden Dawn!
 Ah, it's been a week, Asta.
 Are you here to give a report, as well?
 Have your wounds completely healed?
 Yeah! My stomach still hurts a little, but I ate lots and slept lots, so I'm fine!
 What are you, a kid?
 Who are you calling a kid?!
 You.
 You're the same age as me!
 I'm better because of your  magic, Mimosa. Thanks.
 Why'd she run away?
 When you raised your hand, your arm was  shorter than expected, and it startled her,
 maybe?
 What the hell?! Yuno, you jerk!
 See?
 Damn it!
 Unbelievable.
 What's wrong, Mimosa?
 Mimosa?
 I don't know what to do, Noelle.
 I, um... Whenever I see Asta,  my chest feels tight.
 Ever since that day, all I can think about is Asta.
 What in the world is wrong with me?
 What?!
 I wonder if he'll hate me  after I ran away like that.
 Wh-Why him? He's a peasant,  he's stupid, short, loud...
 I find all those things endearing.
 And the contrast between that and his body...
 Could this be...
 No, no, no. That meathead is just...
 Wait. Why do I sound so desperate?
 No, no, no!
 I don't feel anything for that idiot!
 What are they moaning about?
 Maybe they have a headache.
 I believe headquarters is this way.
 I guess there are things even  you don't know, four-eyes.
 Indeed, there are.
 He's apparently content with  being called ""four-eyes"" now.
 He's much nicer to Asta now.
 We don't often get to come to headquarters.
 Y-Your Majesty!
 I never expected you to welcome us yourself.
 Who's that flashy old guy?
 You fool! That's the current  Wizard King, Julius Novachrono!
 What?!
 This guy is the current...
 ...Wizard King?!
 Well done acquiring this.
 This magic was probably the most  important relic in that dungeon.
 You can read that?
 Somewhat.
 The most important relic! So cool!
 I see...
 He's so excited...
 I guess the rumors about the Wizard King  being a total magic nerd were true.
 Hey, would you try using this magic?
 Please?!
 I'm sorry. I think it activated  in the dungeon once, but...
 I haven't been able to use it since.
 What?
 I see... Aw, that's too bad.
 Sylph, the Wind Spirit of  the Four Great Attributes...
 Apparently she's chosen him this era.
 All I can say for now
 is that this spell will grow with you and,  one day, become an extraordinary power.
 Take good care of it.
 Yes, sir.
 Wizard King! My grimoire has  some weird scribbles in it, too!
 Please look at it!
 Hey, you're being rude.
 This is...
 This is?
 Something I can't read at all.
 I've never even seen this  writing in any documents.
 This thing pops out of it! Take a look!
 Ah, a second anti-magic sword!
 I got mine to work.
 A-Anti-magic... C-Can I touch that?
 Go right ahead!
 Thank... you?! It's so heavy!
 Are you all right, Wizard King?!
 I'm amazed that you can  actually swing this around.
 My magical power... is being absorbed.
 I see.
 Thank you. You can have this back now.
 Yes, sir.
 This is beyond my abilities.
 It appears you're able to wield it  because you have no magic.
 How did you know I don't have any magic, sir?  And about my sword that cuts through magic?
 That's a very good question.
 Well, anyway, you all did  splendidly. Good work.
 U-U-Um, d-d-do you have a moment?
 What is it?
 H-How...
 ...do you become the Wizard King?
 I see. So you both want  to become the Wizard King.
 Any Magic Knight should have that aspiration.
 You two! It's rude to ask the Wizard King that directly.
 Listen. The Wizard King must be proud  and have the trust of the people—
 No.
 It's merit.
 You can't protect others with pride, and the trust of others comes with merit.
 There is only one thing people  want from the Wizard King...
 Merit that proves they are the best.
 Gain merit.
 Continuously gaining merit is everything.
 Anyone who can't do that  can never stand at the top.
 Bring it on!
 Your newbies have very determined eyes,
 William, Yami.
 Now, then...
 We're actually holding a decoration  ceremony for the Magic Knights who've been
 awarded an outstanding number of stars today.
 Deco...?
 Decoration ceremony.
 It's a ceremony where we award those who  have done exceptionally well and honor them.
 Wow...
 I would love for all of you to join us.
 Huh?
 I wonder what decoration ceremonies are like.
 I have a bad feeling about this.
 I could never have imagined this happening.
 Now, then...
 Can you give me better results than them?
 Now, then... let us begin  the decoration ceremony.
 Wizard King Grand Magic Knight Senior Magic Knight, First~Fifth Class Intermediate Magic Knight, First~Fifth Class Junior Magic Knight, First Class Junior Magic Knight, Second Class Junior Magic Knight, Third Class  Junior Magic Knight, Fourth Class Junior Magic Knight, Fifth Class
 Magic Knights of the Clover Kingdom are given ranks to indicate their level of ability.
 The ranks are further divided into sub-ranks, with the Wizard King at the top.
 If knights are awarded a prescribed number
 of stars in the time before the  annual decoration ceremony,
 they are given a new rank by the Wizard King.
 With seven stars earned, Leopold Vermillion of the Crimson Lion Kings,
 I grant you the title of  Intermediate Magic Knight, Second Class.
 You use the same flame  magic as your older brother,
 the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings.  Your power is overwhelming.
 Make sure you don't go overboard.
 Member of the Crimson Lion Kings Leopold Vermillion
 Evil needs no mercy.
 With six stars earned, Sol Marron  of the Blue Rose Knights,
 I grant you the title of Intermediate Magic Knight, Third Class.
 You're as dynamic as the men, and your creative earth magic is amazing.
 But you might be a bit too much of a free spirit.
 Member of the Blue Rose Knights Sol Marron
 The only one who can tie me down is my sis,
 the captain.
 With six stars earned, Solid Silva of the Silver Eagles,
 I grant you the title of  Intermediate Magic Knight, Third Class.
 The maneuverability of  your magic is amazing,
 Member of the Silver Eagles Solid Silva
 but I think you'd be even more amazing
 if you stopped showing off your powers  and cooperated with others.
 I'll keep that in mind, sir.
 With nine stars earned, Nebra Silva of the Silver Eagles,
 I grant you the title of Senior Magic Knight, Fifth Class.
 The skillful illusions you create  with your mist magic are splendid.
 Member of the Silver Eagles Nebra Silva
 Just make sure you don't play with  the enemy more than necessary,
 or you might get bitten.
 I thank you for the warning.
 With seven stars earned, Hamon Caseus of the Golden Dawn,
 I grant you the title of Intermediate Magic Knight, Second Class.
 Just by looking at you, the enemy  would never expect your glass magic,
 Member of the Golden Dawn Hamon Caseus
 and I bet they're completely boggled.
 I thank you, Your Majesty.
 With eight stars earned, Shiren Tium of the Golden Dawn,
 I grant you the title of Intermediate Magic Knight, First Class.
 Unlike your eloquent magic,  you're a very quiet fellow,
 Member of the Golden Dawn Shiren Tium
 so you'd be better off if  you spoke your mind more.
 Understood.
 With eleven stars earned, Alecdora Sandler of the Golden Dawn,
 I grant you the title of Senior Magic Knight, Second Class.
 You amaze me with your  diligence and flexible magic.
 Member of the Golden Dawn Alecdora Sandler
 You can probably relax a  little more once in a while.
 I am honored, Your Majesty.
 The Golden Dawn has earned  a total of 71 stars.
 They are the clear leaders.
 I hope the rest of the squads do  their best to not fall behind.
 Well done, all of you.
 Now then, there's a simple reception  set up for you, so go enjoy yourselves.
 Oh, I almost forgot.
 I've invited some special guests today.
 Make sure you get to know  each other very well.
 Wizard King,
 regarding that matter...
 Something came up, so I have to  excuse myself, but have fun!
 Huh?
 All those stares are beginning to hurt.
 How are we supposed to enjoy this?
 Why is the Wizard King  entertaining us like this?
 Not to mention the Wizard  King went off somewhere...
 The heck is this?!
 I've never eaten anything like this!
 So good!
 How can you be so bold? You're amazing, Asta.
 No, he's just unrefined.
 So good!
 U-Um, Asta...
 May I join you?
 Oh, Mimosa, were you eyeing this meat, too?
 Huh? Oh... Yes, it looks quite delicious.
 Vulgar peasant.
 Why did the Wizard King  invite such lowborn scum?
 I can't sense any magic from him.
 Them capturing the dungeon  must've been sheer luck.
 The way he eats is disgusting.
 It's unnatural for him to be here. Filthy rat.
 Man, listen to them tear into me. Good thing I'm used to it.
 H-He's so forgiving!
 You also have a peasant in your squad.
 The peasant who's forgotten his place  since everyone fawns over him
 because of the four-leaf grimoire he has.
 I could've handled capturing  that dungeon even better.
 That's quite confident, crimson brat.
 It's not like we expect  anything from that peasant.
 We are the ones who embody Lord Vangeance  and the Golden Dawn's ideals.
 W-With all due respect...
 That goes for you as well, Klaus.
 Aren't you ashamed, being here  with your lack of skill?
 I...
 And Mimosa!
 I heard that you were wounded early on  in the dungeon and left the front line.
 To think that you're royalty of  the Vermillion line is laughable.
 I-I'm terribly sorry.
 N-No, Mimosa was...
 Now, now. The most useless fool here...
 is you.
 Wouldn't you agree, Noelle?
 Solid...
 H-How could you?
 You can't even control your magic.  You're such an embarrassment.
 You've basically been exiled  from the Silva family.
 I'm surprised you had the nerve  to return to the Noble Realm.
 Nebra...
 You got a big head from one achievement.
 Did you come here intending to bring shame upon the Silva name?
 N-Nozel...
 You do not belong here.
 Begone,
 failure that killed our mother.
 There's no reason to run from these jerks.
 Asta?
 I thought you'd all be amazing  since you were called here,
 but you're no different from the rest of them!
 Calling us peasants, rats,  embarrassments, failures...
 Who cares if you think we're worthy or not?!
 Just you watch! I'm going to—
 That's enough, you scoundrel.
 You shouldn't even be allowed to talk!
 Silence!
 I won't shut up!
 He just...
 Listen up, you bastards!
 I'm going to pile up merit,
 become the Wizard King,
 and shut you all up!
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward
 (I can't find a place to go)
 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time
 (I will keep believing in you)
 In this ever-vivid place
 (Break free yourself)
 In order to grasp my endless dream
 If there is a path that I should choose
 (Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
 Wherever it may lead us
 Until my life comes to an end
 I will accept any pain that comes my way
 (We can try again, we can try again)
 Even if we can't see tomorrow
 Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
 I'll keep screaming them in my heart

 My Magic.
 I'll show you my magic. It's hex magic.
 In the next ten minutes...
 you'll blink.

 Hey, Asta!
 You're being rude to the senior  members of the Magic Knights!
 Apologize, right now!
 I'll even apologize with you!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Hey, isn't this just messed up?
 Why did I have to get kicked out?
 I have more magical power than the royals do.
 Magic is everything in  this world... isn't it?
 This is a load of bull!
 Who are you talking to?
 I'm just talking to myself.
 We're ready.
 Yeah... I'll show the Clover Kingdom's  Magic Knights the true extent of my powers!

 To act in such a way at a festive occasion like the decoration ceremony...

 You should be ashamed of yourself, Silvas.

 No worries! One can never  have too many rivals!
 What the heck?
 Hey, Asta! You have a very nice body!
 You are indeed qualified to be my rival!
 All right! Let us arm wrestle.
 Why?!
 Guys really are dumb, aren't they, Sis?
 Mind your manners, Sol.
 My bad, Sis!
 Call me ""Captain,"" Sol.
 My bad, Sis!
 Sol...
 I know, Sis!
 Sis!
 Come at me!
 Is now really the time for this?
 Why are you holding back? Come!
 What?!
 Becoming Leopold's rival... Asta truly is amazing!
 My, aren't we all so very noisy today?
 Looks like things have calmed down.
 A royal acknowledging a peasant as his rival?
 Lord Julius allowed the boy to be here.
 He may be a peasant, but doesn't  he deserve a little credit?
 I never thought I'd hear such  nonsense from a royal's mouth.
 It appears that the Vermillion  family has gone soft.
 You're a disgrace to us all.
 What?
 How am I, an eagle that soars the sky,
 supposed to give any credit to an  insect that crawls on the ground?
 Wh-What a tremendous clash of mana!
 H-Holy crap...
 You can feel it?
 Even if I can't feel their mana, I can tell... that this is amazing!
 Shouldn't we stop them, Sis?
 This is foolish. Ignore the men  and their boorish fighting.
 Also, call me ""Captain.""
 Sure thing, Sis!
 Call me—
 Th-There's an emergency!
 What's wrong?
 Th-The capital!
 The capital is under attack!
 Destroy!
 Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy!
 Wh-What's going on?
 Destroy all the fools who  can't understand my worth!
 Such disgusting creatures.  Where did they come from?
 You must not value your lives, if you're invading the royal capital like this!
 Wh-What are these things?
 They keep coming toward us even  when we shoot their limbs off!
 Do not falter!
 Protect the Clover Ki—
 You won't be able to, you scum!
 Get lost, scum! Scum! Scum!
 What is this magic?
 You're stronger than me, right? Right?!
 Get out here, Magic Knights!
 The Royal Capital is under attack?!
 Stone Creation Magic:  Stone Model of the World.
 It's... a three-dimensional  model of the Noble Realm?
 W-Wow!
 Even the voices of the people at  the scene and their magic levels...
 Is he lacing the whole area with mana  and simultaneously making it visible?
 This is much more advanced than  my Magic Flower Guidepost!
 A force with this much magic appears  in five places simultaneously,
 without us noticing...
 A formidable spatial magic user must have  made them materialize in an instant.
 Even then, the guard mages of  the Noble Realm work in shifts,
 constantly keeping a magic barrier in place.
 It should be impossible to  enter with spatial magic.
 Did they analyze the barrier's  mechanism and break through it?
 Or did one of the guard mages betray us?
 Either way, they must  be phenomenally skilled.
 How should we assign the  members we currently have?
 First, we need to guard the  area around the castle.
 Wait, what the heck are we waiting for?!
 I get it! There are people  out there who need our help!
 I'm gonna go!
 Asta!
 Where do you plan to go?
 We don't even know the full situation yet,  and you can't sense magic at all!
 I'm going to where it's noisiest!
 Wha— D-Do you think you're  an animal or something?!
 Interesting!
 Let's see what you've got!
 Wait for me, Asta, my rival!
 Guys really are dumb, aren't they, Sis?
 Yes, they are.
 And call me ""Captain.""
 Leo's still very much a child.
 I'll have to thoroughly retrain him later.
 I'm sure you'd rather not take orders  from me, but listen well, Magic Knights!
 I'll go after Leo and that Black Bulls boy,
 and after I've joined them, we'll head to the north district.
 You, Black Bulls girl, come with me.
 Silver Eagles, I ask that you  head to the central district,
 where the magic is strongest.
 Very well.
 Blue Roses, head to the east district!
 I'd rather not take orders from a man,  but I suppose I don't have a choice.
 Here we go, Sis!
 Call me ""Captain.""
 Golden Dawn, split into two teams and head  to the west and northwest districts!
 We will protect the people of the Nobel Realm.
 Let us go.
 I guess we'll just have  to save dessert for later.
 If we fail to protect the royal capital,  we'll bring shame upon the Magic Knights!
 Do not let the enemy escape, no matter what!
 Right!
 Munchy, munchy...
 I managed to get in by following  Asta and the others,
 but it looks like something  awful is happening.
 This looks like a job for Charmy!
 If I do good, I might get the chance  to eat even better food!
 I smell something delicious!
 I have to fuel up before the battle!

 Don't think you're going to get away with...
 What? What do you want?
 I'll give it to you, just—
 East District
 Mind your manners, Sol.
 My bad, Sis!
 Call me ""Captain.""
 Northwest District
 Those who dare to bring chaos upon the  kingdom shall perish before my magic!
 These things keep getting  up with half-assed attacks.
 In that case...
 West District
 I guess we should work off  some calories before dessert.
 Fools who disturb the peace of the capital... You shall be eliminated!
 North District
 Wh-What is this?
 I've never seen them before.  What country is that army from?
 Where's Asta?
 Little girl... Do you like the Clover Kingdom?
 I-I love it!
 So please... stop this.
 Well, I hate it!
 So the town... the people...
 And you, too, little girl...
 I'll destroy you all!
 Then I'll protect them!

 But a cat might be nice, too.
 Meow, meow.

 Oh, but maybe something  even wilder, like a wolf...

 I will protect the citizens  of the Clover Kingdom!

 Oh, right. I guess you Magic Knights protect the people.
 Just abandon her already!
 Uh-oh. There's no point in getting hurt  just to protect others, is there?

 He's the one who proved that to me!
 If he can do it, I can also...
 become stronger!

 You idiots! Like a true chef could  leave in the middle of cooking!
 I will deliver the best dishes,  no matter the situation!
 That's what it means to be the best!
 Uh, but all the Magic Knights have  been deployed, so there's no one here!
 They left for battle.
 What?! How could they have left  without eating my main dish?!
 Well, our kingdom is in trouble!
 Let's hurry and escape!
 La!
 Wh-Who's this little shrimp?
 This main dish you mentioned...
 Please let me eat it!
 A Magic Knight's robe...
 Which means she must be one  of the big shots that got
 invited to the decoration ceremony.
 And...
 Her glaring eyes are practically on fire.
 Her glaring drool is practically on fire.
 She's...
 someone special!
 All right, you've got it!
 Just wait!
 I'll cook you up the best main dish ever!
 What?!
 Yay! Woohoo!
 Let's just run!
 Cooking...
 is more important than my life!
 Yay!
 North District
 Too bad, you stupid brat!
 Your special anti-magic blade doesn't  mean anything if it can't hit its target!
 Mister...
 This is your chance!
 Run!
 O-Okay.
 Please help him.
 I know. Don't worry, he's...
 a dear friend of mine!
 Okay!
 Come down here!
 Are you stupid?
 Who the heck would come down  just because someone told them to?
 Back at the dungeon...
 Yeah, leave it to me.
 I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!
 I don't have any magic,
 but I've got...
 my friends!
 My magical powers combined with Asta's sword.
 If only I could help him now like I did then,
 even if the enemy is in the air...
 Black Bulls girl!
 I, Leopold Vermillion, shall assist you.
 I shall not let him harm my rival any longer!
 Right.
 You two can deal with him!
 Muddy Water Magic... Mine's a poor match for that.
 Asta...
 His wound from that attack earlier...
 You told me earlier, didn't you?
 To come at you myself?
 You fool!
 I'm not going to fight. I'm going to control my corpses and enjoy the show!
 I'm going to win just by watching.
 That's how I fight!
 Unlike a meathead like you, I actually know how to use my brain.
 Moron!
 Moron!
 Damn it...
 That stupid jerk doesn't even  think of people as people...
 I don't wanna lose to him!
 What's that look for?
 Guts alone won't gonna get you  out of this, you stupid brat!
 Alfred!
 Asta!
 Damn it! What should I...
 Kill him!
 M-My Alfred... turned into  charcoal in an instant...
 He's...
 Damn it... I couldn't defeat him on my own.
 I apologize for horning in on your fight.
 But I thought it would be a shame  to let a man like you die here.
 Forgive me.
 You fought well for a peasant  with no magical powers.
 You're funny, kid.
 Join my squad.
 I hate to admit this, but it looks like  Yami's foresight was better than mine.
 Asta, wasn't it?
 You mentioned that you were going to  become the Wizard King, didn't you?
 Huh?! Become the Wizard King?!
 There's no way a stupid brat like you who's  way weaker than me could become that!
 Then...
 I guess you're my rival, too.
 So you're gonna fight me?
 Finally, someone worth fighting...
 Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
 Fuegoleon Vermillion!
 Asta,
 leave the rest to me!
 Asta!
 Fuegoleon!
 A captain of a Magic Knights squad...
 I guess you're my rival, too.
 Did he just say...
 This is no time for me to be a wuss!
 I can still...
 do this!
 No, you can't.
 My head, my face, and my stomach hurt!
 I'm sure they do.
 As a warrior, you need to constantly  be aware of your condition,
 and determine if you're  able to fight or not.
 You are definitely not  in that state right now.
 Your exuberance may be your greatest weapon, but keep a cool head, too.
 If you truly wish to become  the Wizard King, that is.
 Now, let's hear it.
 What are you after?
 Your actions are too scattered  for an invasion and
 too organized for indiscriminate terrorism.
 Who are you?
 Who am I? You don't recognize me?
 I guess I'm the only one  enjoying this reunion.
 What?
 Six years ago, I was the top choice  for a Magic Knights squad.
 What? You're a former Magic Knight?
 I guess you wouldn't remember.
 I wasn't important enough for  you people to bother with.
 He's a commoner, but he has  tremendous magical powers.
 All who wish to offer,  please raise your hand.
 I see... You're from back then.
 What's your name?
 It's Rades!
 That's right.
 I believe you joined the Purple Orcas.
 They expelled me!
 Expelled?
 Rades, with all of your talent... Why?
 They said that my magic was  dangerous and forbidden,
 and kicked me out of the  squad and the kingdom both!
 Because I was a commoner, no one stood up for me. No one!
 Even though my powers were  better than everyone else's!
 Greater than the nobles'... greater than anyone's!
 I thought magic meant  everything in this kingdom!
 And that's why!
 I'm getting my revenge on the  Magic Knights and this country!
 With my powers! That's what I'm after!
 Though we do have another goal.
 For such a childish reason...
 You can't be serious, you fool!
 Childish?
 Reasons are always simple!
 Leo!
 Fuegoleon?
 Do you need help?
 Definitely not!
 Not at all!
 Hey...
 Very good!
 Wha—
 If you understand, take care of things quickly!
 Yes, sir!
 Wh-Whoa, those brothers are Spartan for sure!
 Way to ask the impossible!
 Our attributes are lousy against each other.
 Not like I'm going to let you help him, but...
 Sorry, but I can't control  the intensity of the flames.
 Flame Creation Magic: Leo Rugiens!
 A magical barrier...
 Number One, Carl!
 When he was alive, he was  an expert at defense magic!
 So I added my curse magic  and made him even tougher!
 He's bringing out one of those things again!
 Asta.
 Y-Yes, sir!
 Do you remember what I said a moment ago?
 Watch carefully.
 Why are you so calm?!
 Defense isn't the only thing he can do!
 Flame Creation Magic: Ignis Columna.
 Trying to match Carl's barrier spells, huh?
 Well?!
 What do you think about this invincible  barrier and super barrage?
 Indeed, there is nothing I can do right now.
 Is that all you've got, Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings?
 Flame Magic: Sol Linea.
 In the instant you attack,
 for just a moment, the mana of  the barrier thins in places.
 That's what I aimed for.
 I deal with difficult magic every day.
 Listen well, all of you!
 As long as you are Magic Knights,
 you will find yourselves constantly pitted  against powerful enemies and magic!
 But when that happens, if you gauge the ability calmly
 and maintain a bold fighting spirit, you will never lose!
 Is that clear?!
 Yes, sir!
 He instantly saw his opponent's weaknesses,
 and even psyched up his allies.
 So that's a Magic Knights Captain.
 H-He's awesome!
 I-Impossible! My Number One  was defeated so easily...
 D-Damn it! Damn it!
 Rades, wasn't it?
 Even if you possess extraordinary abilities  and polish them to their fullest,
 without a righteous spirit, your deeds are nothing but violence!
 No one will acknowledge something like that.
 I have a report, Your Majesty.
 Most of the attackers have  been dealt with, it seems.
 Took them long enough.
 The Magic Knights need to work harder.
 And? Where's the Wizard King?
 Why hasn't he come to my side?
 He's on an important mission.
 Honestly... There's no way it  could be more important than me.
 West District
 What were those things, anyway?
 Regardless, they're apparently no match for us.
 East District
 I can't believe you fools  tried to attack my sis!
 Only the women of the Blue Rose  Knights are allowed to touch her!
 Sol, don't say things  people will misinterpret.
 The only ones who can touch  Sis's soft, velvety skin are...
 That's not what I meant.
 Central District
 What? Finished already?
 But I wasn't done playing.
 Something is off.
 Northwest District
 I guess that's most of them.
 Th-They were so gross.
 I need to get stronger so things like  this don't trouble me so much.
 Th-They're so strong!
 Hooray for the Magic Knights!
 Hooray! Hooray!
 It's too early for you to  be cheering just yet.
 I think everything's about ready.
 Now for some lively sow's mana...
 How exciting!
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward
 (I can't find a place to go)
 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time
 (I will keep believing in you)
 In this ever-vivid place
 (Break free yourself)
 In order to grasp my endless dream
 If there is a path that I should choose
 (Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
 Wherever it may lead us
 Until my life comes to an end
 I will accept any pain that comes my way
 (We can try again, we can try again)
 Even if we can't see tomorrow
 Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
 I'll keep screaming them in my heart

 Palace Three-Second Cooking
 Palace Three-Second Cooking.
 The time where I, the royal  head chef of Clover Kingdom,
 introduce a three-second dish  that anyone can make.
 Today, I'd like to make some  curry in three seconds.
 I'm going to be using simple curry  roux procured at the market.
 Next, you'll need carrots, onions, potatoes,
 some mushrooms, and maybe some tomatoes.
 If you try adding secret ingredients  like chocolate or coffee,
 you can make an even more fragrant curry.
 Now, then... You take  those ingredients, and...
 Immediately chop them up using  your magic, and simmer them!
 Make sure you use plenty of love and passion!
 And it's finished. Wasn't that easy?
 Time to eat!
 So good!
 And that concludes this episode of Palace Three-Second Cooking, dishes anyone can make!
 See you next time!
 But that's impossible!
 Magic Knights, hurry up and  take care of the attackers.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.

 And cower at reality
 I can't stand the idea
 Of just making excuses to give up
 Stand right there
 I don't want to be near you
 Any minute now
 Just wait right there
 (The decisive battle is still a long way off)
 Black and blue
 I'll give up on giving up
 And get the world on my side
 I'm looking for the reason I'm alive
 Every time somewhere under this sky
 Break through the tearful nights
 And head where the light shines
 I want to keep my promise
 I'll deliver it to you

 Blackout
 Why?
 I have magic that's stronger than anyone else's.
 I studied everything there was about my  magic, polished my skills, and prepared!
 All for this day!
 For years... and years!
 And yet... Why?!
 Noelle, I thank you!
 You can save the thanks! Just hurry up!
 But of course!
 Flame Magic: Ignis Columna!
 How'd you like that?! I made him  evaporate with intense firepower!
 Ow...
 Excellent! Well done!
 You are definitely a man worthy of leading this country!
 Yes, sir!
 I accidentally saluted, too.
 I-Impossible...
 Impossible! I've got as much magic as a royal!
 I...
 Flame-Binding Magic: Leo Palma!
 L-Let go of me!
 I'm still—
 Damn it! Damn it!
 At this rate, I...
 There are many questions I'd like to ask you.
 But before that, I will be  confiscating your grimoire.
 Don't!
 Don't touch my grimoire!
 What is this grimoire?
 S-Stop it!
 There's only one page?
 Don't! Don't look at it!
 He can only use one spell?
 Damn it!
 Give it back!
 Don't you dare look down on me!
 Who's gonna look down on you?
 Couldn't you think of any other way to get  people to acknowledge your power?
 You have amazing magic, and you were strong enough to claw your way up...
 It's such a waste!
 Here. I'll lend you my arm.
 Thanks.
 What you lacked to overcome adversity...
 was a righteous heart.
 Pay for your crimes.
 Are you satisfied now?
 A voice...
 What's the matter?
 It was impossible for you to beat  a captain on your own after all.
 I-It's not impossible...
 I...
 The sheer volume of your magic isn't enough.
 I'm also reaching my limit.
 You're through acting on your own.
 From now on, things are  going to go as planned.
 All for our master.
 West District
 The Magic Knights are amazing!
 Hooray for the Golden Dawn!
 Now, then, I think I'll go have some dessert.
 Would you like to join me?
 I will decline.
 East District
 Thank goodness...
 Let's go back to our lodgings and  wash off all this sweat, Sis.
 Indeed.
 Great job, Blue Rose Knights!
 Lady Charlotte is so elegant.
 Lady Charlotte is so lovely.
 Sol is so cool!
 Central District
 What is their motive?
 Northwest District
 Looks like they're in the marked areas.
 My grimoire...
 What?
 Well done, Magic Knights.
 No—
 Sis!
 Wh-What the?
 The Magic Knights...
 Lady Charlotte... disappeared.
 Sol...
 Where are we?
 It would appear that we're at least
 a few hundred kilometers  away from the royal capital.
 They got us! Damn it!
 They managed to infiltrate the royal capital.
 I figured they must've had a rather  skilled spatial magic user, but...
 To think they were able  to send us all this far.
 Curses!
 What the...
 The Magic Knights' mana...
 I can't feel it anymore.
 This is unprecedented spatial magic.  Was there another spellcaster?
 Wh-What's going on?
 I have no idea.
 To think the great Magic Knights would  all fall for a silly trap like that.
 How stupid can they be?
 I was supposed to play with the stragglers,  but it looks like I won't have to bother.
 Now, then... I'd better use this  time to get some nice, young mana.
 Ash Curse Magic: Ash Absorbing Formation.
 Wh-What the?
 No! What's going on?
 Excellent. Just look!
 My skin is silky smooth.
 Even water would bounce right off of it.
 No! Save me!
 Stop acting all cute, you sow!
 Eliza! W-Wake up!
 Well, aren't you a handsome young man?
 Say, do you think I'm pretty? How old do I look?
 Well?
 H-How could you? You monster!
 Who are you calling a monster?! Die!
 Oh, my.
 I guess someone was able to  escape that spatial magic.
 My, you're hot and my type. Say, want to have some fun with me?
 Get away from those people,
 you old hag.
 I'll murder you!
 My, you're hot and my type. Say, want to have some fun with me?
 Get away from those people,
 you old hag.
 I'll murder you!
 Who are you calling an old hag?!
 Ash Curse Magic: Cheerful Ash Destruction.
 These are curse bullets  with various curses inside.
 You won't know what you'll  get until they hit.
 Who are you people? What are you after?
 My, my. Look at you,  with such ample time to talk.
 Well, since you're hot,  I guess I'll tell you.
 We're here to eliminate someone. That's our goal.
 Eliminate someone?
 Who do you think it is, darling?
 Well, I'm definitely not going to tell you.
 You're working with at least one other.
 A spatial magic user must have  infiltrated the royal capital.
 Where are they?
 Have they already fled?
 No matter where you might've sent  the rest of the Magic Knights,
 you don't have enough power  to take over the royal capital.
 I can't imagine that this was  just to go after the king.
 King's Quarters
 You've made it clear that  your motive is revenge,
 but what are you and the  others after overall?
 Our true motive...
 is you, Fuegoleon Vermillion!
 What?
 Fuegoleon!
 What do you—
 This is spatial magic.
 Very well. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
 Fuegoleon!
 What is this place?
 The attacks keep coming. She has a tremendous amount of magic.
 These ash bullets themselves  don't do much damage, but...
 Oh, dear...
 Are you all right? It looks like you're  having a hard time getting around.
 I wonder what you've been hit with.
 Damn it...
 I... can barely see anymore.
 I'm gradually losing sensation throughout my body, too.
 Hey, can you hear me? Hello?
 My ears are also going... This is her power?
 My Ash Curse Magic: Cheerful Ash  Destruction works very gradually.
 First, your eyes stop  working, then your ears,
 and then your body stops moving.
 You'll pay for having the  insolence to call me an old hag.
 People expected a lot from my four-leaf clover...
 I even joined the top Magic  Knights squad, the Golden Dawn.
 Yet... what am I doing?
 Who cares about a four-leaf clover? That stupid peasant, getting a big head...
 Hmph. He lacks the talent worthy to  be a member of the Golden Dawn.
 I'm sure he won't last long.
 All those voices around me don't matter.
 I'm only bettering myself so I won't lose. But...
 I couldn't win.
 What defeated that guy was  a power I just happened upon,
 one that I can't control.
 Not to mention...
 That power doesn't seem  to want to listen to me.
 The only reason I was able to  avoid the spatial magic earlier
 was because something other than my own power reacted.
 It's not like we're expecting  anything from that peasant.
 No, that's not it.
 That's not why I'm frustrated.
 Where are you attacking?
 You have to aim properly, like this.
 If you say, ""I'm sorry, miss,"" and adorably  beg for your life, I'll forgive you.
 Not a... chance...
 I can't see... anything...
 I can't feel... anything.
 This is... the flow of mana?
 It's said that mages with wind-based  mana are excellent at detecting mana.
 With all five senses cut off
 and his back against the wall, Yuno's finely honed concentration
 demonstrated an astonishing ability to detect mana,
 and was attempting to go beyond even that.
 Come on, hurry up and beg for your life.
 If you don't, I'm just  going to have to kill you.
 There are so many things I want  to ask you. Hey, can you hear me?
 Hey, come on. Answer me!
 Would you shut up?
 I couldn't care less about you.
 I just...
 don't want to lose...
 to Asta!
 Not yet!
 That grimoire...  The legendary four-leaf clover?
 Huh? Mana is gathering...
 This sensation... He's...
 He's controlling the mana?!
 I see. The spirit has constantly  been sending me mana signs.
 I was relying so much on my sight and  hearing that I wasn't noticing them.
 Let me just tell you one thing about me.
 I...
 hate losing more than anything else!
 Wind Spirit Magic: Sylph's Breath!
 No! I have to use the magic  I stole to defend myself, or I'll—
 You're...
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward

 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time

 If there is a path that I should choose
 (Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
 Wherever it may lead us

 Birthday.

 I shall name her Bell, and today is Bell's birthday.
 This cake is for you, Bell.
 Yay!
 Should we say you're one year old?
 Happy birthday, Bell.
 So pretty!
 Make a wish and blow out the candles.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The mysterious enemy,
 controlling an army of the dead to attack the royal capital,
 was restrained by Fuegoleon,  along with Asta's help.
 Couldn't you think of any other way to get  people to acknowledge your power?
 What?
 Well done, Magic Knights.
 No—
 Most of the Magic Knights were sent
 far away from the royal  capital with spatial magic.
 I figured they must've had a rather  skilled spatial magic user, but...
 To think they were able  to send us all this far.
 This is spatial magic.
 Very well. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
 The captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
 Fuegoleon Vermillion, was also sent away somewhere.

 That spell pinpointed him,
 so there's no way the spellcaster  could've cast it from far away.
 Where could they be?
 Huh? Asta?
 You're right there!
 He was hiding among the corpses?!
 I'm impressed you found me.
 I figured I'd be found if  I used magic to transform,
 so I went to the trouble of  making this filthy disguise.

 Oh, no... His grimoire is breaking apart!

 The captain of the Crimson  Lion Kings just taught me...
 I need to think calmly.
 How can I stop him?
 That spatial magic...
 Not giving up is my magic!
 And my sword can...
 Cut through magic!
 What?!
 Ow! What the hell are you doing, you little shit?!
 Not good...
 You have the nerve to say that  after hurting all those people?!
 This...
 is pain!
 This is what you did to innocent people  as you laughed about it!
 Stop!
 Getting hurt and bleeding  are signs of being weak!
 Those who lack magic should just  get their asses beat by those
 who are more powerful!
 Especially... pieces of trash like  you who don't have any magic!
 I'm here to make sure...
 that doesn't happen!
 And...
 Even those without magic  can become the best!
 I'm going to prove that by  becoming the Wizard King!
 Valtos! Do something!
 If I could, I would've by now.
 That anti-magic is more  troublesome than I'd imagined.
 Looks like we're going to have  to take care of him first.
 He's gathering magic? What's he—
 Is he going to attack using spatial magic?
 Asta, look out!
 Too late!
 How can I be panicking?
 I always need to remain calm...
 Right, Fuegoleon?!
 Leopold!
 This isn't good... We can't  afford to lose Rades, too.
 D-Damn you all! Get away! Stay back!
 Pathetic.
 We received orders from Master  to come here, and look at you...
 You're struggling against  this lot. How pathetic.
 Such piercingly cold magic...
 There are five new enemies!
 I was only scratched... but thanks to  that curse, the bleeding won't stop.
 If I lose any more blood, I'm in trouble.
 No one asked for your help!
 Aw, you should be thanking us.
 If we hadn't arrived,
 you definitely would've been captured and dissected alive.
 And if you're gonna be dissected,  I want to be the one to do it.
 Shut up!
 Anyway, it looks like the tables have turned!
 Asta!
 You...
 Now I can keep fighting!
 Please watch me, sir!
 This brat... He struck himself with his  own swords to get rid of the curse?
 Unbelievable... He's so stupid!
 Wow, he's fun. Can I dissect him later?
 Quiet.
 Boo. You're such a spoilsport.
 All I've ever faced since  I was born... was adversity.
 No matter how many come at me, no matter what happens,
 I'll blast them all away!
 All right! Come at me!
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward
 (I can't find a place to go)
 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time
 (I will keep believing in you)
 In this ever-vivid place
 (Break free yourself)
 In order to grasp my endless dream
 If there is a path that I should choose
 (Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
 Wherever it may lead us
 Until my life comes to an end
 I will accept any pain that comes my way
 (We can try again, we can try again)
 Even if we can't see tomorrow
 Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
 I'll keep screaming them in my heart
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 They Won't Find Me
 They Won't Find Me.
 Leopold! He's not the spatial magic user.
 That spell pinpointed him,
 so there's no way the spellcaster  could've cast it from far away.
 Where could they be?
 They won't find me.
 I can't find him!
 Nope!
 I'll kill you.
 Nowhere to be found!
 It's about time...
 I'll make my grand entrance  and surprise them!
 I'm pretty sure they're not here. Let's go look over there.
 Yeah.
 Let's see who can find them first!
 What?
 What...?
 Magic Knights, eat my cooking and fight!
 I'm going to fight my battle in the kitchen!

26,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 You're right there!
 I'm impressed you found me.
 What are you, an animal?
 But it appears that it's over now.
 Over?
 What's over?
 We've completed our mission.
 We're leaving before the other  Magic Knights come back, Rades.
 Asta, wasn't it?
 I'll eventually kill you and make you into one of my toys.
 Look forward to that, you little brat!
 Not giving up is my magic!
 And my sword can...
 Cut through magic!
 What?!
 Ow! What the hell are you doing, you little shit?!
 Not good...
 You have the nerve to say that  after hurting all those people?!

 There are five new enemies!
 I was only scratched... but thanks to  that curse, the bleeding won't stop.
 It looks like the tables have turned!
 I would always close my eyes
 And cower at reality
 I can't stand the idea
 Of just making excuses to give up
 Stand right there
 I don't want to be near you
 Any minute now
 Just wait right there
 (The decisive battle is still a long way off)
 Black and blue
 I'll give up on giving up
 And get the world on my side
 I'm looking for the reason I'm alive
 Every time somewhere under this sky
 Break through the tearful nights
 And head where the light shines
 I want to keep my promise
 I'll deliver it to you
 shape of love
 Wounded Beasts
 Things have quieted down.
 Has the enemy been taken care of?
 Yum, yum, can't move. Can't move, can't move...
 My meal-saving prince...
 I hope the Magic Knights are okay.
 Asta!
 You...
 Now I can keep fighting!
 Please watch me, sir!
 This brat... He struck himself with his  own swords to get rid of the curse?
 Unbelievable... He's so stupid!
 Wow, he's fun. Can I dissect him later?
 Quiet.
 Boo. You're such a spoilsport.
 All I've ever faced since  I was born... was adversity.
 No matter how many come at me, no matter what happens,
 I'll blast them all away!
 All right! Come at me!
 It seems he's lost his mind  in the face of our numbers.
 Whatever. He's about to die anyway.
 There's no use in fighting.
 You need to learn when to give up.
 Oh, so that's him.
 So this is the anti-magic  brat our master spoke of.
 Your exuberance may be your greatest weapon, but keep a cool head, too.
 If you truly wish to become  the Wizard King, that is.
 Keep a cool head... Right, sir?
 I'll stay calm... while I kick their butts!
 This little...
 Flame Magic: Exploding Flames!
 Wow!
 You think I'm going to let you people  throw your weight around
 after what you did to my brother?!
 Let me join you, my rival!
 Sure! Go right ahead!
 They say beasts are more formidable  when they're wounded. These two...
 are dangerous.
 What the hell are you doing?!  Hurry up and kill them!
 We know.
 They aren't our targets...
 But we'll kill them now!
 Noelle!
 Don't think that you can  kill my friends so easily!
 Wow...
 That's quite the defensive spell.
 Judging from your appearance, you must  be a member of the royal Silva family.
 In that case, I'll use my grimoire  against you. I wouldn't want to be rude.
 Tree Creation Magic: Magic-Draining Roots!
 Asta!
 I know.
 What are you planning to do?
 No... They swallowed my torrent.
 Your fighting instincts are admirable.
 Wind Creation Magic: Tornado Needles!
 He's...
 He's too fast.
 Asta! Leopold!
 Now, let's end this.
 N-No way...
 No!
 Ooh, what's this magic? I've never  seen anything like this before!
 E-Everyone...
 The Magic Knights...
 How dare you send us that far away?
 Impossible... They managed to return  here from that distance so quickly?
 We really didn't want to, but we  all worked together to get back.
 I suppose you could call it  super compound magic.
 Joining forces once in a while isn't so bad.
 Well, I guess men aren't completely useless.
 I'll acknowledge their abilities. Nothing more.
 I'm never working with them again.
 We really don't play well with others.
 But our nine Magic Knights squads exist
 solely to protect the peace  of the Clover Kingdom!
 Noelle!
 Mimosa, please take care  of Captain Fuegoleon.
 No... How could something like this happen  to someone like Captain Fuegoleon?
 Not to mention Leopold and Asta...
 Hey, wake up!
 You're alive!
 They put Captain Fuegoleon  and the others in such a state.
 Who...
 It'll cost us if we keep fighting. Let's retreat.
 Don't be in such a hurry.
 Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver!
 Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!
 My magic will just pierce  through magic like that.
 And then...
 Dark Magic Item: Special  Properties Plus Alpha... absorbed!
 They managed to deflect the captain's  magic as if it were nothing!
 What... is that magic item?
 No—
 Mine!
 What do you plan to do with him?
 It's a secret!
 Remember this, Magic Knights.
 We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.
 Asta!
 Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!
 My magic will just pierce  through magic like that.
 And then...
 Dark Magic Item: Special  Properties Plus Alpha... absorbed!
 They managed to deflect the captain's  magic as if it were nothing!

 No—

 What do you plan on doing with him?
 It's a secret!
 Remember this, Magic Knights.
 We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.
 Asta!
 They took... Asta.
 We have to save him!
 Noelle, we can't.
 But—
 It's unfortunate, but we have  no way of tracking them.
 Yes, but—
 No.
 Right now, strengthening the royal  capital's defenses takes priority.
 There's no guarantee that  those were the only enemies.
 We don't have any time or magic  to spare on someone like him.
 How are Fuegoleon and Leopold doing?
 The best I can do with  my magic is first aid!
 He needs to be taken to the medical ward  for more advanced healing magic, or he'll...
 Some captain he is. How pathetic.
 The Vermillions sure aren't what they used  to be. Makes me embarrassed to be a royal.
 Solid, how could you say that?
 We are Magic Knights.
 Our existence is pointless unless we win.
 Nozel...
 That's right! This is going to ruin the  reputation of the Crimson Lion Kings...
 But Solid...
 As we were not present at the fight, we are even less than he is.
 Strengthen the defenses so that  there won't be further damages.
 Right.
 They've spread around magic that  blocks transmission spells,
 and the chain of command is in chaos.
 Because of that, reinforcements from outside  the Noble Realm couldn't arrive.
 We can't let our guard down yet.
 Sol, we're going to reinforce the area. Don't let your guard down.
 You got it, Sis!
 Call me ""Captain.""
 I know, Captain Sis!
 My goodness. Looks like we'll have to  wait on dessert a little while longer.
 Klaus, go to headquarters  and get reinforcements.
 Yes, sir.
 Asta...
 Rades, we ended up with a huge headache  because you stepped out of line.
 Don't get carried away just because  the master has taken a liking to you.
 How dare you say, ""I want  to fight a captain alone.
 I want to lay waste to the capital""? You conceited fool!
 Shut up.
 If you'd just done what you were told, we wouldn't have to go through all this trouble.
 My toys were the victims in all of this!
 This doesn't concern any of you!
 I heard that Catherine was captured, though.
 Who the hell cares about that old hag?
 Hag...
 We got what we went there for, so who cares?
 By the way, Sally...
 We won't be able to take that brat with us.
 Kill him.
 What? No way!
 He uses anti-magic!
 This is on a different level than a  mere magic-weakening effect!
 I'm going to use him in my research!
 Let me take him! Please? Please?
 Where am I...? What is this?  It feels sorta nice.
 Only those acknowledged by  the master can go there.
 Don't cause any more unnecessary trouble.  Kill him before our master arrives.
 What?
 Aw...
 I know! Let me kill him!  I'll make him into my toy!
 Crap, I've...
 Shut up, Rades.
 What?!
 I've been captured by the enemy?
 Hey, you're awake.
 A-A girl?
 You should help me convince them!
 I want to study everything about you and  your grimoire, and do some experiments,
 and then dissect you in the end!
 You want every last cell of yours  to help with my research, right?
 She's really bad news!
 Right? Right? Right?
 And this is a super bad situation!
 I can't move! I can't run!
 Please? I'll ask properly, so please?
 Don't blame me for whatever happens.
 Give him to me!
 Nope!
 Hi there.
 I've been waiting for you.
 Wha—
 Ooh!
 H-He's...
 The Wizard King, Julius Novachrono?!
 What's he doing here?
 How was the royal capital?
 Kill him!
 I-Impossible!
 I killed them.
 It would've been too difficult  with your numbers...
 Restraining all of you, I mean.
 Wait, what?
 You guys attacked the royal capital, right?
 You didn't actually kill people without being ready to die yourselves, did you?
 Such power...
 This is the Wizard King?
 Crap... I don't have any magic left...
 That being said, you all seem pretty skilled.
 You'll probably give me some trouble.
 How about it? I'll let one of you  survive, so why not surrender?
 It'll be first come, first served. What do you think?
 Don't underestimate us!
 Wha... How is he moving like  that?! I can't keep up!
 I guess I don't have a choice.
 I might be able to handle these numbers.
 Time Binding Magic: Chrono Stasis.
 What... is this?
 I can't move...
 ...at all.
 I guess I was able to restrain all of you.
 Were you more worn out than I thought?
 See how it feels to live  in one unending moment.
 Ow...
 Hey there, Asta.
 We seem to be connected by fate somehow.
 R-Right...
 He managed to take care of all of  them despite how strong they were.
 This is the Wizard King's power?
 This is...
 You want to become the  Wizard King someday, right?
 In that case, watch carefully  and don't look away.
 This is only a small fraction  of what you'll have to surpass.
 He's my goal! The strongest guy there is!
 He's the strongest mage in the  kingdom that I need to surpass!
 Can you stand?
 I can't stop shaking after witnessing  the Wizard King's power firsthand!
 You idiot!
 Stop shaking! Stop!
 You can't lose here!
 I guess you didn't need my help.
 All of you had some interesting  magic. I was surprised.
 Now, then... I have some  questions for you all.
 What are these jewels and this stone slab?
 I've never seen these characters  or patterns before.
 What are you trying to accomplish with this?
 Well, it's not like you can answer  that while you're in that spell.
 I guess we can take our time back at  the Clover Kingdom to talk about this.
 Something's coming?
 That's blinding!
 What is this light?!
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward
 (I can't find a place to go)
 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time
 (I will keep believing in you)

 That's no big deal! Nero's much cuter.
 If you put him in a bowl, he's delicious.
 Ma?!

 They're all dangerous!
 Wow! The Wizard King himself showed up!
 I wanna research him. I wonder  if he'd become my sample.

 Light
 Everyone's gone!
 Looks like he got us.
 He took all of his little friends back.
 Light magic that's faster than my own...  I wonder if that was the enemy's boss.
 He seems interesting... I mean, formidable.
 But...
 We managed to keep one.
 I finally got through.
 Where are you, Wizard King?
 Hello there, Marx.
 Sorry about that. I've been a bit busy,  so I blocked the communication spell.
 Never mind that. Please hurry to the medical ward.
 Fuegoleon... Leopold...
 I hope they wake up soon.
 Indeed.
 We've strengthened the magic barrier  and repaired the communication spells.
 We've gathered more Magic Knights
 and are having them scout  every inch of the town
 to ensure no enemies remain.
 I'm sure the royal capital is fine now.
 We're also looking for that awfully loud— er, lively Black Bulls boy.
 He wouldn't die so easily!
 Curse you, Asta. I'm going to  punch you when you get back.
 This magic...
 Hey, everyone. Great work.
 Th-The Wizard King?
 Asta!
 H-Hey, guys. Looks like you're all here.
 Is that... an enemy?
 Man, I thought I was done for.
 Hmph! It's because you're always so reckless.
 I hope you learned your lesson, Stupidsta.
 Thank goodness!
 Asta!
 You're safe, Asta!
 I'm... I'm so glad you came back alive!
 I thought you were dead. I'm so glad.
 Y-Yeah... Thanks for worrying about me.
 I thought you were going to punch him.
 Asta!
 I was so, so worried about you!
 I-I'm sorry!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 I see...
 Despite how strong Fuegoleon is,  we don't know when he'll wake up.
 That was a miscalculation on my part.
 No, this was due to our inexperience.
 We've confirmed that the pendant  Fuegoleon was wearing is missing.
 Pendant?
 Could that be what they were after?
 Who in the world could they be?
 From what they said,
 they appear to be a terrorist group  with a grudge against the kingdom.
 We are the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 The ones who will destroy the Clover Kingdom.
 But it doesn't seem to be that simple.
 The jewels embedded into that stone slab...
 Was Fuegoleon's pendant a part of that?
 It had several holes  that were still empty,
 but what happens when  they gather all of them?
 There is the possibility that Fuegoleon  was targeted because of his pendant,
 but there's also a high possibility
 that his strength and ideals  would've gotten in their way.
 I've been investigating  various dissidents in secret,
 and this is the first time  I've picked up their trail.
 But to think that they were planning  something that extraordinary and powerful.
 Maybe I shouldn't have left the capital.
 We'll get the details from our captive later.
 In any case,
 people look to the Magic Knights for one thing...
 Peace in the Clover Kingdom.
 In order to preserve that, we'll keep  fighting with everything we have.
 Yes, sir!
 If you'll excuse me.
 Nozel...
 What is that guy's problem?
 We're supposed to be showing solidarity  right now. Take the hint, man!
 Has the enemy
 awakened not a sleeping lion,  but a sleeping hawk?
 Pathetic.
 What an appalling spectacle.
 Never let this happen again, Nozel.
 And Fuegoleon, I will find  the scum who did this to you
 and slay them myself.
 I hope I never feel this useless again.
 Right.
 We shall become stronger.
 Indeed.
 I'm the one who'll become the strongest!
 Leopold!
 You need to be resting!
 Asta! I'm relieved that  we both pulled through!
 As my rival who has faced death  with me, you must also get stronger!
 I will surpass my brother!
 I'm going to be the next Wizard King!
 And this...
 Fuegoleon,
 what is that mark on your forehead?
 Ah, this?
 This mark is handed down in the Vermillion  family as a sign of a personal oath.
 It's worn only by those prepared to  conquer themselves and become king.
 This... is the mark of my oath.
 Yeah! I don't really get it, but it looks  like you're worthy to be my rival.
 So... who the heck are you, anyway?!
 What?!
 How?! How could you still not know who I am?!
 I only remember people who  properly introduce themselves!
 I am Leopold Vermillion!
 We're going to be friends,  so call me Leo!
 Y-You're moving way too fast!
 I don't want to hear that from you!
 The Wizard King concluded that  the attack on the royal capital
 had been the work of  anti-Clover Kingdom terrorists.
 He declared his intent to continue  resolutely opposing them,
 and the masses were fully supportive.
 The enemy's invasion was enabled by
 the disappearance of some of the mages who  maintained the capital's magic barrier.
 Had the enemy done away with them, or had they defected?
 This fact was not made public, but the Wizard King was sure of it.
 I don't want to believe it,
 but there's a traitor among the  mages in the royal capital.
 Interrogation Room
 It's no use.
 There's some kind of protection on them,
 and I can't search for information.
 Even if there wasn't, we'd never talk.
 Our master is the light in the darkness!
 He's our god!
 He's the only one who hasn't abandoned us.
 We will never betray him.
 Apparently, their master has some absolute unifying force and fearsome magical power.
 I'm assuming the one who defeated  Captain Fuegoleon is also their master.
 Indeed.
 When he wakes up, we may learn something.
 Let us wait for the Lion King to awaken.
 Damn it! Damn it!
 Damn it!
 Damn it all to hell!
 They hurt. They hurt...
 My wounds hurt!
 That stupid little brat Asta...
 I'm going to kill him, no matter what!
 I'm going to gather the  ultimate army of the dead!
 That anti-magic kid, Asta...
 You can't kill him, Rades.
 I want to tinker with him  while he's still alive.
 What?
 Not to mention, I already  treated your wounds,
 so there's no way they'd still be hurting.
 Shut up! They still ache!
 I saw that brat first!
 Hands off, Sally!
 Can't hear you, can't hear you, can't hear you!
 I hope I see you again soon, Asta!
 For the next time I see you, Asta...
 I'll use the little samples  I got while you were in the gel,
 and research and research!
 I couldn't save Geork and Catherine.
 Those two have big egos,  but they worship you.
 They won't give them any information on us.
 That's not what I'm worried about.
 As long as they're alive, I will save them, no matter what.
 I thought I had dodged it, but I seem  to have taken a little of the attack.
 Magic that accelerates  time... and drastically.
 The Wizard King... As expected,  he has phenomenal power.
 But we will build up our  strength and defeat him.
 In order to get our revenge and establish  a new country that will be ours alone.
 Mister and Miss Magic Knight,
 thank you for saving me!
 No problem!
 I just did the obvious thing.
 This is to thank you. I made them myself.
 They look great!
 Thank you so much!
 Bye, now!
 So good!
 Why...
 ...are you here, Charmy?
 Where the nummy things are, there I shall be!
 More importantly, have a bite.
 La? La?
 Uh, she gave those to us...
 Don't sweat the details.
 Come on. They're delicious.
 Th-Thanks?
 I guess I don't mind having one...
 It's good!
 What a surprise. It's actually good.
 You seem to be in an unusually good mood.
 I had a fateful encounter.
 You're probably too young to understand.
 By the way, how did you get into the castle?
 Like this!
 Seriously?
 Is her magic actually really amazing?
 That's...
 Hey!
 It's Asta and Noelle.
 Asta!
 Have your wounds fully healed? I asked you that before, didn't I?
 I'm fine, like I said before!
 Yuno, I heard you took down the enemy  like it was nothing, you jerkface!
 Jerkface?
 My meal-saving prince!
 Hey, Yuno! Greet me properly, you jerk!
 Wait, you know my prince?
 Don't get a big head just  because you took one down!
 Courtesy makes the world go round!
 Yuno?
 Huh? Was that too much?
 What do you think you're doing, Yuno?!
 Is he stupid?! Was he  actually trying to kill us?
 See ya, Shrimpsta
 See ya, Shrimpsta.
 Who are you calling ""Shrimpsta,""  Yuno, you jerk?!
 Come down here and fight me right now!
 Don't shoot something like that  just so you can write magic letters!
 Don't you dare ignore me and leave!
 Ah, the ferocious storm of love.
 Ignoring me is the worst thing you could do!
 Hey, wait, Yuno!
 Yuno's magic has gotten much stronger.
 What could've happened in  such a short amount of time?
 Asta,
 I'm going to get stronger,
 so the next time we meet, I'll be able to fight alongside you!
 And then... And then...
 I guess we'll just have to fight  when we both get a lot stronger.
 I'm not going to lose, Yuno!
 The stronger you become,  I'll get even stronger!
 Black Bulls' Base
 Welcome back, Magna, Luck!
 Man, I'm so exhausted from my mission.
 So tired.
 However!
 We got recognized for our  deeds and got a star!
 That's right, Magna!
 Not so close!
 Our combo attack, the Crackling Magna Typhoon, was amazing, wasn't it?
 Crackling Magna Typhoon
 We're never doing that move again!
 Thank goodness you're all back safe.
 I'm gonna keep on showing the  other Black Bulls how it's done!
 Asta, my time has arrived!  Make sure you keep up!
 Yes, sir!
 Oh, by the way, Magna.
 What's up?
 They were so impressed with what I did  during all the trouble at the capital
 that they made me a third-class junior  Magic Knight at a special awards ceremony!
 Huh?
 What?!
 Wait, what's a third-class  junior Magic Knight?
 No idea.
 What?!
 Have you guys been Magic Knights all  this time without knowing what that is?
 It's a Magic Knight rank.
 And since you guys haven't  changed since you all joined,
 you're still fifth-class Magic Knights.
 Better start showing Asta some respect.
 What?!
 Huh?
 And by the way, Charmy became  a first-class junior Magic Knight.
 On your knees, inferiors!
 What?!
 Make sure you follow me, you inferiors!
 Apparently, they were impressed that  she captured one of the rebels.
 Looks to me like she was just trying  to beat her up, though.
 Worship me!
 What's that weird dance?
 This is somehow very infuriating!
 Anyway, well done, kid.
 But Captain Fuegoleon...
 Huh? Fuegoleon?
 Who do you think you're worrying about, punk?
 That hot-blooded king of seriousness  won't die that easily.
 I bet he'll come back even stronger.
 Of course!
 All right! I'm going to train even  harder and get stronger, too!
 No, you're gonna rest.
 Huh?
 You're too injured. You're going to die. Are you stupid?
 But you made me do it in the first place!
 Yeah! You need to take a break!
 You too, Noelle?
 How stupid are you?
 A break...
 A break? You're getting time off, Asta?
 Then let's head to a mixer!
 Huh?!
 A m-mixer?!
 You get to work.
 I'll set everything up!
 I just told you to get to work.
 Things are getting busy!
 I'll kill you.
 Wait, do you wanna come too, Captain Yami?
 My dry emotions gaze at the me from that day
 And push me forward
 (I can't find a place to go)
 Even the faintest light can  still break through the darkness
 And change the flow of time
 (I will keep believing in you)
 In this ever-vivid place
 (Break free yourself)
 In order to grasp my endless dream
 If there is a path that I should choose
 (Do you wanna try? Do you wanna try?)
 Wherever it may lead us
 Until my life comes to an end
 I will accept any pain that comes my way
 (We can try again, we can try again)
 Even if we can't see tomorrow
 Holding onto feelings too intense to voice
 I'll keep screaming them in my heart

 Captain Yami's Lecture on Magic Knight Rankings
 ""Captain Yami's""... Wait, what is this?
 ""Magic Knight""... Ugh, I can't be bothered.
 Wizard King Grand Magic Knight 1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight 1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight 1st Class Junior Magic Knight 2nd Class Junior Magic Knight
 Wizard King Grand Magic Knight 1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight 1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight 1st Class Junior Magic Knight 2nd Class Junior Magic Knight  3rd Class Junior Magic Knight 4th Class Junior Magic Knight 5th Class Junior Magic Knight
 So the most important is the Wizard King,  and then there's Grand Magic Knight...
 This is too much work.
 Why are you making a Grand Magic Knight read this?
 I'll kill you!
 What?!
 Is this what they call love?
 My meal-saving prince!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The One I've Set My Heart On
 Finral Roulacase, a member of the Black  Bulls Magic Knights Squad, was troubled.
 It was a very important matter.
 What do I do? What should I do?
 Finral's troubles had nothing  to do with a mission...
 ...about tonight's mixer?
 A mixer, meaning a gathering  between men and women.
 It is a dinner intended to help  men and women get acquainted.
 When I set this up, three girls  agreed to come, and that's great!
 The more girls, the merrier!
 But the problem is who  else I'm going to bring.
 Asta's a delight, so I'm bringing him  for sure. I just need one more...
 Hup!
 Flame Magic:
 Exploding...
 Fireball!
 Home run!
 Didja see that?
 This is what truly makes a man!
 Yeah, no. I know there are girls who like delinquents, but...
 Pleased to meet ya! My Crazy Cyclone's on fire!
 This is what truly makes a man! Brr-r-r-rm, brr-r-r-rm!
 Magna's too much of a delinquent.  He'd just scare them off.
 Almost... I'm almost done
 with my life-size statue of Marie.
 Ah, Marie. It feels like  you're right next to me!
 My beloved little sister, Marie!
 Ah, you truly are an angel!
 Yeah, no. Even if I took him to a mixer...
 Marie's more of an angel than any of you.
 I want to have a mixer  with a hundred Maries.
 Yes. Marie was already an angel  before she was even born.
 Ugh... A sister complex?
 Really?
 He'd definitely scare them away!
 I heard that you were having a mixer.
 You want me to come with you?
 Yeah, I have no idea what Gordon's  thinking, so that's not happening.
 No, really. You don't need to hold back.  It's not as if I don't like girls.
 It might be fun to bring Charmy along, since she's sort of like a mascot character.
 But...
 Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...
 This is so yummy, too!
 Excuse me, could I get seconds?
 I do apologize. It's only been  five minutes since we opened,
 but we're out of ingredients,  so we must close for the day.
 D'oh!
 The mixer'd be over in five minutes!
 At least, that's what I assume would happen.
 Maybe I could take Vanessa...
 But she's a woman!
 Let's not.
 Now this is paradise.
 Maybe I could go all-out and invite Yami...
 I'm sure there are girls  who like older guys.
 Yami does hate gaudy types, though.
 Why the hell are you three  dressed like that, huh?
 Aren't you showing too much skin?
 What if you catch a cold?  Put something warm over your stomachs!
 Uh...
 Not happening.
 So overbearing.
 Maybe not.
 Basically, that leaves...
 A mixer? Yeah, sure.
 Great! Thanks for agreeing to come.
 Well, Luck looks decent,  so I'm sure things will work out.
 So, what's a mixer, anyway?
 Will this actually work out?
 All right, it looks like we're all set.
 Should we go dressed like this?
 We have to make sure they know  that we're Magic Knights.
 Magic Knights are the most admired figures  in the Clover Kingdom, after all.
 Got it!
 Are mixers strong? I'm so excited!
 Yeah! I'm excited, too!
 Well, let's go.
 Come on. Hurry on through.
 Got it!
 Can I go, too? I promise  I won't get in the way...
 City in the Common Realm: Nean
 Hup!
 I-I'm in the clear.
 Sneak... Sneak, sneak... Sneak, sneak, sneak.
 When I heard they were going to a mixer,
 I was so worried, I ended up following them.
 I can't believe this. Why are they going to a mixer?
 This is the problem with lowly fools.
 I-I mean, it's not as if I like that muscle-brained shrimp or anything!
 I don't care who he hangs out  with or what happens after that!
 Wait, who am I even making excuses to?!
 I'm pretty sure it was  somewhere around here.
 Oh, there it is!
 The Dreavy Hinker
 Okay! Looks like we all have our drinks, so let's get right to the introductions!
 I'll go ahead and start.
 Finral Roulacase 21-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Touta
 I'm 21 years old and from Touta!
 I'm Finral Roulacase, the spatial  magic user from the Black Bulls!
 Nice to meet you!
 These are freshly picked moon blossoms.
 Please take them as a  token of our friendship.
 Wow! They're beautiful!
 These only bloom at night  on Mount Anahu, right?
 They smell so nice!
 Thanks...
 Hook, line, and sinker! I'm finally  going to get a girlfriend!
 But for that to happen, I need both  Asta and Luck to do their best.
 Go on, introduce yourselves.
 Introduce myself...
 Am I just supposed to say what I like?
 Okay.
 Luck Voltia 18-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Ibon
 I'm Luck Voltia, and I'm 18 years old. I'm from Ibon and belong to the Black Bulls.
 My hobbies include fighting tough  enemies in bloody, mortal combat!
 Isn't ""fighting for your life"" a wonderful phrase?
 Introduce myself... A manly man should  probably talk about his dreams.
 Right...
 Asta 15-Year-Old Member of the Black Bulls From Hage Village
 I-I'm Asta. I'm fifteen. I'm from Hage Village. I'm a member of the Black Bulls!
 Um... my dream is to become  the Wizard King someday!
 The Wizard King?
 That'll never happen.  He's just a kid, anyway.
 These two seem kinda...
 How d'ya like these biceps?
 ...sketchy.
 I mean, I heard they'd be Magic Knights,
 but they just had to be Black Bulls,  the lowest of the low?
 And if he's from Hage, isn't he a peasant?
 Like, a total peasant?
 I'd never go out with any of these guys  if they didn't earn more than me.
 And if they're younger, shorter,  and socially beneath me...
 Not happening.
 Crap... This seems to be going south.
 Okay! We've introduced ourselves,  so now it's your turn, girls!
 Let's keep things rolling! Yeah!
 We're passing the baton to you!
 Um... We're friends.
 Rebecca Scarlet
 Helene Barbary
 Erika Sitate
 I'm Erika. I work at a dressmaker shop.
 I'm Helene, and I work as a hairdresser.
 Rebecca. I work at a restaurant.
 They're clearly losing interest!
 Wow, so you all have  solid jobs. That's great!
 Say, I'd love to hear about your work.
 I'd love it if you made some clothes for me.  What do you think would look good on me?
 Maybe you could cut my hair sometime.
 I've been thinking of  changing up my hairstyle.
 Could I eat at your place sometime?
 No reaction whatsoever! I need to think  of something they'd be interested in!
 W-Want to hear about the Magic Knights?
 Yeah, tell us!
 I'd love to!
 Bingo!
 That's great to hear. Well, I use spatial magic to go to all sorts of places.
 Something I've done recently at my job...
 Yes?
 Crap.
 Hey. Send me to the john.
 Yes, sir.
 Hey. Send me to the bath.
 Yes, sir.
 Hey. Send me to my bed.
 Yes, sir.
 I don't think I've done anything lately  other than move Yami around.
 Luck! You've been working hard!  What have you done recently?
 Me?
 Tell them something interesting  you've done at work lately.
 Helene and the other girls  really want to know.
 Work, huh? Let's see... Oh!
 The other day, we ran into  a group of ten bandits...
 Yes, and?
 ...and I beat them all to a pulp!
 It was so brutal! And so much fun!
 I could've easily killed them all, but I just broke three of their bones.
 It completely backfired!
 Oh, and when I fought this mage, I—
 Right. Thanks, Luck!
 Now, go on and eat up, my boy!
 Oh, I'm done?
 I'd love to hear what Asta's been up to!
 You protected the people of the royal capital, didn't you? Great job!
 Y-Yes! I did!
 Oh, you mean the incident the other day?
 When the capital was attacked?
 Yup! Asta worked really  hard and got promoted!
 Really?
 Hey, this is going well. We just need to keep taking the conversation in this direction!
 You must be amazing!
 Well, I didn't manage to protect myself. They put three holes in me.
 They hurt like hell!
 Hey, it's all squishy!
 Ow! Hey, don't poke at them.
 These two are useless!
 I should've known a mixer  wouldn't work with these two!
 All of our members suck!
 Ow, ow, ow! Come on, stop!
 Hey, are you mad?
 No, but...
 I heard them mention a mixer,  so I ended up tagging along.
 But thankfully, it doesn't  seem to be going well.
 Like I said! I don't care  what happens to Shrimpsta!
 Hey!
 Hey, waitress!
 Huh?
 Get me another beer!
 Get it yourself, insect.
 What?
 So you know about that huge incident  at the capital the other day?
 I just happened to be on bodyguard duty  for a VIP in the capital that day,
 < Lies >
 and just happened to defeat  a number of the intruders.
 Bah-ha!
 They gave me an exceptional promotion
 and bumped me up to  Intermediate Magic Knight all at once!
 It's a such a hassle, really.
 It's not like I'm even that talented.
 < This is true >
 Bah-ha...
 Whoops. Maybe I'm a little intoxicated...
 with myself.
 Oh, and you were looking at a  dirty mag during all that, right?
 Hey, what are you talking  about? Of course not!
 Shh, shh!
 What's wrong? You guys  nervous to be around us?
 Bah-ha! You don't have to be so nervous.
 He just squeezed lemon all over the fried chicken without asking first.
 At least ask first...
 What the heck is this mixer from hell?
 I'm pretty sure I've seen this  guy before. He's, um...
 Bah-ha!
 Right! Bah-ha!
 To think that my bronze magic  would be so formidable.
 I even terrify myself.
 You there, waitress! Get me another drink!
 Bah-ha!
 Hurgh!
 Herf herf!
 Nice!
 Oh, so that's the kind of magic  you use when you cut hair.
 Yup. I just go like this.
 It doesn't take much magic, but you  need really good control! Show me more!
 Huh? Oh, sure...
 His eyes are so pure.
 He has such a cute smile, but there's danger behind it.
 I think I might like that gap  more than I want to admit.
 Crap... I think I'm starting  to like bad boys.
 Hey, could you show me your magic, too, Luck?
 Sure! It's a bit cramped in here, so let's go outside.
 Okay!
 Well done, Luck!
 And the sunrise looks really  beautiful from there.
 Really?
 I'll take you there with my  spatial magic sometime.
 Want to go camping with me?
 I think I might like that.
 Hey, want another drink? Excuse me, could we get another drink?
 He's a bit gaudy and not really my type, but he's the best out of the three.
 He seems like a noble, and spatial magic would be really handy.
 Plus, he's considerate and kind.
 Say, want to step out to the patio?
 I guess I wouldn't mind.
 I wasn't sure how things  would go for a second,
 but I think things might just work out!
 This is so awkward.
 Why does this lady keep  looking away and down?
 Is she mad? Did I do  something to make her mad?
 Not good. I need to liven things up.
 I'm not really sure how,  but I have to liven things up!
 Right! It's my turn!
 Um...
 What's your favorite food?
 I love tatoes.
 You don't have to force yourself  to make small talk. This is dumb.
 Erika told me that I should  find a good guy for the sake
 of my siblings, so I came along.
 But this isn't the real me, and I'm  too worried about my siblings at home.
 So you live with your siblings?
 I have three younger brothers  and two younger sisters.
 Really? That's nice.
 Oh, I have five siblings, too, though we're not related by blood.
 I'm not with them right now, but they're all a bunch of little brats.
 They annoyed me sometimes,  but we had so much fun.
 We used to all sleep in the same bed.
 Now that I'm in the Magic Knights, I get  my own room, so it's a little easier,
 but not having those fidgety little brats  sleeping next to me gets a bit lonely, too.
 Yeah! They can be a pain, but it  gets lonely when they're not around!
 Exactly! And you can act like a  dork in front of your friends,
 but you always want to impress your siblings!
 I totally get that!
 Hey! They're actually having fun?!
 Wh-What the heck's going on?
 H-Hey! What do you think you're doing?
 You just asked for a job out  of the blue, so I hired you,
 but then you blew away some customers!  Who do you think you are?
 Silence, insect.
 What?!
 Come to think of it, you seem  like a big sister, Rebecca.
 You definitely don't seem  like the oldest, though.
 I have one brother who's the  same age as me named Yuno...
 Well, well...
 You look like you're having fun, o great Magic Knight.
 Aren't you a little small to be one?
 Are you really a Magic Knight?
 If a little twerp like you got in, I could probably get in, too.
 Yeah, I'm surprised I made it in, too.
 And being out with a flashy little  thing like this? I sure envy you.
 Bet you're desperate to catch yourself  a Magic Knight, aren't ya, missy?
 Pretty sure I've seen you somewhere before.
 Oh, you're the girl who works  at the local restaurant,
 always carrying a kid on your back and working until you're drenched in sweat.
 Are all those brats yours? That must  mean your man walked out on you.
 No! That was my brother!
 Well, then, of course you'd like  to get yourself a Magic Knight
 and enjoy the easy life.
 If you want a man that much,
 come hang out with me.
 Hey! Let go of me!
 I don't know what your deal is, mister,  but don't judge people by their appearances!
 You don't know anything about her, do you?
 Ooh, scary!
 What kind of amazing magic are you  gonna show me, widdle Magic Knight?
 I can't use magic.
 What? A Magic Knight that can't use magic?
 What kind of lousy joke is that?
 But...
 Hup!
 Okay, time to go home.
 That was a waste of time.
 Let's get more drinks somewhere else.
 H-Hey, sir!
 Let's get out of here!
 H-Huh?
 Hey!
 Hey, boss! I quit!
 What?! Hey!
 Thanks, Asta. I feel so much better!
 Nah. Sorry for ruining the mixer.
 It's fine.
 He's a bit short, but he's actually...
 Hey, Asta... D-Do you have  anyone that you like?
 Yup! There's somebody  I've got my heart set on!
 What?!
 I see.
 I'm sure she's a wonderful person.
 She is! We're from the same—
 I wish you both the best.
 Thanks!
 Hey, come by my restaurant sometime.
 You can play with my siblings.
 I will!
 ""Same""?
 The same squad?! Then... could...  could that mean... mean m-m-m-me...
 No! No, no, no! And what if it is?!
 It's not like I th-think... anything... anything of...
 Sister, we spent so many  years together in Hage.
 One day, I'll become the  Wizard King and come for you!
 Please marry me then!
 Just because I'm supporting him  doesn't mean I'm going to give up.
 By the way, what's the  point of a mixer, anyway?
 What?!
 What?!
 Apparently he threw some drunkard to  the ground. Black Bulls are so violent!
 Right? Let's go home!
 She shot me down...

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Royal Capital of the Clover Kingdom
 Time passed, and the title of Wizard King  has been passed down to the present day,
 where the Wizard King still  protects this kingdom
 along with his Magic Knights.
 The Magic Knights have a total of  nine squads under the Wizard King.
 They are squads of mages trained in combat.
 The band of heroes who risk their  lives to protect the kingdom,
 the Wizard King and the Magic Knights,
 are what all citizens of the  Clover Kingdom aspire to be.

 Sister!
 Please marry me!
 Who would've thought that even Asta  would do so well as a Magic Knight?
 I guess it pays to live long.
 Fifteen years ago, Asta and Yuno were  abandoned in front of our church, and now...
 How they've grown!
 Because of the money they send us monthly,
 we were able to fix our roof,
 and we won't be short on tatoes this winter!
 Father...
 I apologize.
 Thank you.
 It's all yours.
 Really? Okay.
 Magic is everything in this world.
 Asta and Yuno that day...
 We've never had a Wizard King from this area,
 nor anyone who's actually achieved  greatness in the Magic Knights.
 I sincerely hope that one of you  will become the Wizard King someday.
 Ahem.
 Now it's time
 for the awarding... of the grimoires!
 This is my grimoire?
 Yuno received the legendary grimoire  with the four-leaf clover.
 I'm going to become the Wizard King.
 However, Asta, who had no magic...
 Um...
 My grimoire's not coming.
 Now to down some moguro leaf juice  that I haven't had in a while, since it
 supposedly increase magical powers!
 Yeah!
 What the heck?!
 That's actually amazing!
 That's way too funny!
 What is that grimoire?
 That sword!
 Just who are you?!
 You little wretch with no magical powers!
 He... nullified my magic?
 Even without magical powers...
 I'm going to become the Wizard King!
 Not giving up...
 is my magic!
 Look! Look!
 My very own grimoire!
 I don't even know how,  but I was able to get one!
 Everything turned out all right.
 Yuno, Asta... You're the  pride of this village.
 There, there...
 My Observation Diary of My Very Best Friend, Asta
 The first time I encountered Asta was  at the Magic Knights Entrance Exam.
 He shone from the moment I laid eyes on him.
 One of us is going to become the Wizard King. Our legend's beginning now, Yuno!
 I'm gonna show you just how much  I've grown in six months...
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 What the heck are these birds?!
 What's with that kid?
 Talk about a loser!
 That's pretty bad, even for  someone from the boonies.
 Get away from me, you stupid birds!
 That's...
 ...one of the captains of  the Magic Knights Squads.
 All right. The next exam  shall be the last one.
 You will engage in actual combat.
 Fighting is our duty. Show us your true abilities!
 I have to stand out by fighting  someone who looks strong.
 Bah-ha! Fight me, Asta.
 Sekke! You're willing to  fight a loser like me?
 Let's both give it our all and fight fair,  so we can achieve our goals!
 Begin!
 No holding back, all right?
 Let's do this, Asta! Bah-ha!
 Bronze Creation Magic:  Sekke Magnum Cannonball!
 There's no need to hold back. Come at me! Bah-ha!
 Sure thing.
 Here I go.
 I'm not joining
 the Magic Knights so I can have a good time and avoid working hard.
 I'm here to work my butt off  and become the Wizard King!
 ""So cool.""
 So cool.
 S-So much pressure!
 This is...
 the magical power of a  Magic Knights Squad captain?
 You said earlier that you wanted to  become the Wizard King, didn't you?
 Now that I'm standing before you, do you still have the nerve
 to say that you're going  to be the Wizard King,
 even without any magical powers?
 E-Even if I can't join the  Magic Knights today...
 No matter how many times I fall,
 no matter what anyone says to me,
 I'm still going to become  the Wizard King someday!
 You're funny, kid.
 Join my squad.
 Huh?
 I'm telling you that I'll let  you join the Black Bulls.
 I wasn't the only one who had realized  Asta's brilliance. The captain had, too.
 That's how Asta became a  member of the Black Bulls.
 And as for Asta's childhood friend, Yuno...
 All who wish to offer,  please raise your hand.
 What?
 Seriously?
 All of the captains...
 ...raised their hands?!
 Th-That's amazing.
 I-I thought that only royalty and  nobles could join the Golden Dawn.
 All of them! That's amazing!
 I'll take the best path to  becoming the Wizard King.
 Please allow me to join the Golden Dawn.
 Being Asta's childhood friend
 would also make him Asta's  best friend's childhood friend.
 That would mean Yuno  and I are also best friends.
 My Observation Diary of My Very Best Friend's Best Friend, Yuno
 Now, then...
 I guess I'll write my entry for today.
 My dearest friend Asta was  working hard again today.
 Scrubbing the floors...
 Cleaning...
 Doing laundry.
 B-But my heart belongs to Sister Lily.
 Next!
 Taking care of the beasts.
 Sit!
 There, there. Good boy.
 Here.
 What the heck are you doing, you jerk?!
 Let go of me!
 It's hot!
 This kind of heat is nothing to  a member of the Black Bulls!
 What? You're getting out already?
 N-No, not yet! I'm not done yet!
 It's hot. I want to add cold water. But...
 Hanging out naked really is great.
 Ugh, he's so stupid.
 Don't you agree, Nero?
 He's so reckless.
 He's been like that ever  since our first mission.
 When we had to hunt that wild boar.
 And when we finally got to Saussy Village,  we ended up running into those weirdos.
 Hey!
 Yes, sir?
 This is your execution.
 I won't forgive this!
 Do you think you can  protect those beasts now?
 Asta!
 Too slow!
 You have no chance of winning.  Why won't you give up?
 If I give up, who's going to protect them?
 I've realized something.
 It's not just because of our promise.
 I'm going to become the Wizard King
 so I can protect everyone!
 Wizard King, my butt!
 What does he think would've  happened to him if I wasn't there?
 Well, I mean, I guess there have  been times where I thought he
 may have actually done a good job.
 Wait, no! That's not what I meant!
 Why would I care about that  shrimpy little peasant?
 I'm a royal!
 He's so stupid.
 Even in the dungeon...
 Your opponent...
 is me!
 How's that?
 Disappear!
 What are you doing, Stupidsta?
 Noelle...
 Hurry up and
 defeat that guy, Asta!
 Yeah, leave it to me.
 I'll throw enough at him from the both of us!
 Move. I'm going to make that girl,  that weakling, disappear!
 Like hell I'll let that happen!
 I don't have any magic,
 but I've got...
 my friends!
 I don't really get it, but I did it!
 I messed up...
 Asta...
 Asta!
 I mean, at least he was okay, but...
 You saved me. Thanks.
 I'm so sorry!
 Thanks, Asta. I feel so much better!
 Nah. Sorry for ruining the mixer.
 It's fine.
 Hey, Asta... D-Do you have  anyone that you like?
 Yup! There's somebody  I've got my heart set on!
 If you've got your heart set on me, don't make me worry so much.
 Who are you worried about?
 S-S-S-S-S-Stupidsta! How long  have you been standing there?
 I just got back from training!
 What are you up to, Noelle?
 Hmph.
 Huh?
 Why?!
 Hmph!
 Tonight's mission will be a bit rough.
 I'll do my best!
 Is your body back in tip-top shape, Yuno?
 If your wounds still haven't healed—
 I'm fine.
 You're so kind, Klaus.
 Nonsense!
 Bringing along someone who's wounded would slow us down.
 It's not as though I'm  actually worried about Yuno!
 Let's go.
 You're not getting on?
 Huh? Um...
 I was just thinking it'd be nice  to ride on my broom tonight...
 There's no reason to hold back.
 It won't take that much more  magic to carry you two.
 Oh, I'm not holding back.
 The thought of not wanting to be  seen on that ship by anyone I know
 never crossed my mind.
 Not happening.
 You bastards! You dare mock my ship?!
 I didn't.
 Hey! Hold it, Yuno!
 You're not allowed to act without permission!
 If you'll excuse me, too.
 Huh?
 I don't have any time to waste.
 I need to become stronger.
 Stronger...
 But you're the one who gave me hope.
 Even if you're poor, an orphan...
 or even us...
 We can become greater than anyone  else in this world. And to prove that...
 To make Sister and everyone else happy...
 Let's see who can become the Wizard King!

 It's Not as Though I'm Actually Worried.
 Yes, he's brushing each tooth carefully,  with short strokes, ten to twenty times.
 You mustn't scrub so roughly!
 The bubbles are heading toward his eye!
 Safe!
 He's not kicking off his blanket and getting too cold, is he?
 You're so kind, it's almost creepy, Klaus.
 Not happening...
 We're off work today?
 I feel like all we ever do  lately is take time off.
 I'm going to play with Rebecca's  younger siblings, then!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 He's so strong...
 What the hell was that magic?
 So, how would you like to die?
 P-Please spare us! We'll never  attack the village again!
 I won't kill you this time.
 Huh?
 Because today is...
 Marie's birthday.
 Huh?
 Come on. Celebrate Marie's birthday with me.
 Who the heck is that?!
 Rejoice greatly, rejoice  with all your might,
 and then die.
 I'm going to die anyway?!

 Father!
 They sent money again this month.
 Great!
 Are they doing well?
 We'll be able to eat lots of tatoes again.
 Yay!

 Apparently Yuno became a first-class junior Magic Knight.
 That's awesome! It's only been  two months since he joined!
 Yuno is the hope of Hage!
 What about Asta?
 I'm sure he's trying too hard  and being a burden to everyone.
 Asta, you can come home at any time!
 Let's see... ""Hello, Sister Lily,  brats at the church, and Mayor.""
 What about me?!

 Asta's also become a  third-class junior Magic Knight?!
 What?!
 I see... I guess Asta's working hard, too.
 To think our Asta is finally...
 Both of you stay healthy, and do your best!
 The Golden Dawn's Headquarters
 Yuno.
 I heard you moved up to first-class junior Magic Knight.
 Congratulations.
 It's no big deal.
 Exactly.
 We wouldn't want you to get too cocky.
 I still far surpass you in  both rank and experience.
 Klaus?
 Take this.
 A little gift from your senior in honor of your promotion.
 You sent all of your pay  back home, didn't you?
 Klaus is so shy.
 He was so happy when he heard  you had been promoted
 that his glasses were sparkling with joy.
 It's a bit smothering.
 Black Bulls' Base
 All right, all eyes up here.
 We just got paid, so no work today.
 Yeah!
 All right! I'm gonna train real hard!
 Thanks, Mr. Yami!
 Awesome decision, sir!
 Let's drink! The night's still young.
 Time for second breakfast!
 Munchy, munchy, munchy...
 I'm gonna hit on all the girls!
 Ocean girls? Mountain girls?
 All the girls meet... me!
 By the way, Gauche, good job  handling that many guys yesterday.
 Today's my sister's birthday, so could I have  the next year off, until her next birthday?
 No.
 I'm so bored! I wonder if anyone  will attack the royal capital again.
 Hey! Maybe I'll attack it!
 That's a bigger no.
 Your luck with money goes  up if you polish gold.
 None of these guys intend to work at all...
 Cotton Creation Magic: Sheep Cooks!
 Time to eat!
 Munchy, munchy, munchy...
 You've got tatoes!
 I procured the local specialty from my  meal-saving prince's hometown, Hage Village!
 Dig in, everyone!
 Thanks! So good!
 It's so dry. Must be full of fiber.
 It's so flaky.
 It completely dried out my mouth.
 So dry...
 Munchy, munchy...
 My love for my meal-saving prince  provides the best seasoning!
 I wonder what I should get my  goddess Marie for her birthday.
 All right! I'm gonna get all the cuties—
 Hold it.
 Oh, right...
 You want to do some gambling, so you  want me to take you into town again?
 No, before that...
 Not sure if it's the fiber working,  but I'm about to hit my limit right now.
 That is the one limit you may not hit!
 Evil, begone!
 Honestly...
 How am I supposed to find anything to do  when we get a day off on such short notice?
 Magna!
 If you have some time,
 I was wondering if you could drop me off  somewhere on your super-awesome broom!
 I can't say no to my cute little underling. Where do you wanna go?
 To Nean!
 I-Isn't that...
 The place where those guys had the mixer?
 And what are you gonna do there?
 Well...
 Well?
 I'll tell you on the way!
 What the heck?!
 I-It's not like I care what he does.
 A-And I have absolutely no interest  in who he's going to see!
 Get on. Let's get going.
 Huh? Right now?
 Otherwise, we're not going.
 Let's go!
 Hold on tight!
 O-Okay, so I do want to know!
 City in the Common Realm: Nean
 To my dear, beloved little sister Marie...
 I just arrived in the city you live in.
 My job as a Magic Knight is rough, but if it's for you, it's not really rough at all.
 I can even buy you presents with my pay.
 A former convict like myself is only able to live a proper life
 for the sake of your angelic cuteness,  Marie. It's all thanks to you.
 Ah, already, my nose won't stop bleeding.
 Lord Gauche!
 We've been waiting for you!
 Come in! We've got plenty of birthday  presents for you to choose from!
 Hurry up and show me around.
 Right away!
 First up, we have these!
 All little girls love plushies,  and plushies love little girls!
 I'm sure her delight will show in her angelic smile.
 Thank you, Brother!
 I-I'll take them all...
 Thank you, sir!
 Next, we have this.
 I'm sure the little darling will enjoy  her days playing house as she fantasizes
 about living in a mansion like  this with her beloved brother.
 Brother!
 Welcome home!
 I'll take that, too.
 Thank you, sir!
 Lastly, we have this! With this outfit,  your little sister can be a real angel!
 Brother...
 I love you!
 Give me everything in the shop.
 Thank you, sir!
 What?! You're going to see a  chick you met at the mixer?!
 Yup! I promised Rebecca that I would  play with her little siblings.
 M-Man, you're already meeting  her family? Way to go!
 Don't mess this up.
 Got it!
 There it is!
 All right! I'm going to play  with all the strength I've got!
 Don't get too crazy!
 To my dear, beloved little sister Marie...
 Please forgive your brother for  being late due to his anemia.
 I bought you lots of birthday  presents. Please be happy!
 I used up all of my pay, but no  price is too high for Marie.
 I will be able to see my  little angel Marie soon...
 I'll be able to see her smile...  Oh, my beloved Marie.
 Marie... Marie... Ma—
 How do you like that, Marie?
 This is fun! You're so strong, Asta!
 Me, too!
 And me!
 All right! Are you read—
 Huh? What?
 Get away from her this instant, you trash!
 Hey, you're my senior with the sister complex who's always getting nosebleeds!
 Don't call me a guy with a sister complex  and nosebleeds, meathead runt!
 I'll stomp you to death!
 I train hard, so you'll have  to try harder than that!
 He's so annoying.
 I'm only able to see my sister, who lives at the church, once a month!
 Today is the one day that I get  to release my pent-up feelings,
 worship the heck out of my sister,  and do all kinds of things with her,
 so why are you worshiping her first, huh?!
 See? You do have a sister  complex and a nosebleed!
 So wait, she's your sister?
 Don't you dare point at my angel.
 I showed you her picture before!
 Did you?
 I was just visiting Rebecca,  and she just happened to be here.
 Hi...
 That guy is scary.
 What does he mean by ""all kinds of things""?
 Shh!
 Man, Marie sure is cute.
 Of course she is! More importantly, why  do you have your eye on my little sister?
 Stop!
 Please don't be so mean, Brother!
 I'm going to marry him!
 I'm going to marry him... I'm going to  marry him... I'm going to marry him....
 Marry him?!
 I ended up following him because I was  curious, but what the heck's going on?!
 Um... May I ask for the fare now?
 Will this do?
 That's too much!
 I'll kill you... I'll kill you... I'll kill you...
 Huh? What was that?
 I'll kill you... I'll kill you... I'll kill you...
 I'll kill you!
 Mirror Magic:
 Reflect Ray!
 Wh-What the heck's up with that spell?!
 I'll kill you!
 Brother, stop!
 It sure is noisy out here.
 Marie, it's time. We must  go back to the church.
 Sister!
 Tch.
 Oh, so you came, Gauche.
 You old hag!
 It's not ""old hag,"" it's ""Sister.""
 Marie's about to go on a date with me.
 Go back to the church by  yourself, Sister Old Hag.
 Not happening. It's time.
 You go home, you sister complex punk.
 In any case, it's not good for Marie  to spend time with a guy like you.
 Your attitude's always terrible. You have mean eyes and a filthy mouth.
 What did you say, you shitty old hag?
 See? Filthy.
 Shut up. Die.
 You've got some nerve,  saying that to an old lady
 who's not long for this world, you fool.
 Yeah, right, dumbass.  Says the old she-demon who'll
 probably live another hundred years.
 Don't talk to people like  they're monsters, you thug!
 Shut up, gangster hag!
 Gauche!
 How can you talk to your elders like that?!
 You shouldn't!
 You stay out of this!
 Anyway, go on home.
 Let's go, Marie.
 Brother, Asta! See you later!
 M-Marie!
 See ya!
 See you later!
 You okay, sister complex guy?
 M-Ma... Ma... Ma...
 What a weirdo.
 Why don't you come in and have dinner at our place while you wait for him to wake up?
 You're welcome to spend  the night... if you want.
 Really?!
 Yeah!
 Yeah, come over!
 S-S-Spend the night?!
 He's going to spend the night at the home  of a girl he just met?! Is he stupid?!
 How stupid can he be?!
 And Asta is so funny!
 That really loud boy?
 Yeah!
 S...
 So good!
 Isn't it?
 This is so good!
 Would you like some moguro fruit?
 So fast!
 All these dishes are so good  that I can't put my spoon down!
 Really? I'm glad to hear it!
 You'll be a great wife one day, Rebecca!
 It's no big deal...
 What are you talking about?! There's more to being a good wife than just being a good cook!
 Sissy, are you going to marry Asta?
 N-No, Marco!
 Of course she's not!
 You should totally jump him tonight, Sis!
 You idiot! What are you saying, Luca?!
 Goo goo.
 Y-You too, Pem?! Do you even  know what you're saying?!
 J-Jump him? No, you dummy, dummy, dummy!
 What's going on? What is this?
 It's not even winter! Why is it so cold?
 Huh?
 You should totally jump him tonight!
 Goo goo.
 Y-You too, Pem?!
 You dummy! Dummy, dummy, dummy!
 I-I would never do anything like that!
 I-I'm just going to check and see if  Luca and Marco are actually asleep...
 Asta...
 Die, Asta.
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray.
 Hot!
 G-Gauche?!
 Die, Asta.
 Why? Wait, what? What's going on?
 Huh? What?!
 I won't allow you to marry Marie. I'll make  sure it doesn't happen by killing you.
 What?!
 Kids say stuff like that all the time!
 Only cowards attack people in their sleep!
 I don't care if it's cowardly or not, as long as I can kill you.
 Mirror Magic:
 Real Double.
 Now there are two Gauches?!
 First he shoots beams out of a mirror, and now this? What's up with his magic?
 Your crime...
 is the fact that you met my little sister.
 Wouldn't that make most people criminals?!
 Shut up. Die.
 That's not even your house!
 S-Snow? When did it pile up so much?
 It's not even the season for that yet.
 I don't care about that. Just die.
 Hey! What do you two think you're doing?!
 Rebecca! I'm so sorry!
 Now's not the time for that!
 The kids are gone!
 Huh?
 Urian, where are you?

 Hey!
 Von is gone!

 I can't disappoint Marie...  I'll have to rely on my clone...

 Spin her around...
 I can't put Marie in danger.
 That's true!
 Then I'll just have to do it for her.

 I'll never let you marry my sister.
 Now's not the time for that!
 There's nothing more important  than Marie, damn it!
 I'll kill you!
 Hey, what the heck's going on in this town?
 Why is it snowing this time  of year? This is absurd!
 Noelle? What are you doing here?
 I-I just happened to be in the area. It's just a coincidence.
 Who's this, Asta?
 She's one of my Magic Knight buddies.
 And Noelle, this is my friend Rebecca.
 Friend...
 Buddy...
 Huh...
 What's wrong?
 N-Nothing...
 More importantly,
 I saw a whole bunch of kids go  up to the mountains earlier.
 What's that about?
 Do you guys have some  festival this late at night?
 That must be...
 I'm going to make you bleed.
 Stop it.
 Old hag...
 The old Sister!
 I feel magical power in this snow.
 There is magic at work here.
 Magic that can control others...
 and that only affects children  whose magic hasn't matured.
 What?
 A number of ours were taken, too.
 What do they mean to do,  taking all these children?
 Hey, old hag, what do you mean, ""taken""?
 Don't tell me Marie was, too!
 Sadly, that is what I'm saying.
 You old hag!
 Sister Theresa!
 How could you let that happen, you stupid old hag?!
 Please stop!
 So quick to resort to violence...  You really are a failure.
 If you want to hit me, go ahead.
 But that won't bring back the children. It won't bring back Marie.
 You're right.
 But I won't feel better until I do!
 Asta! Are you all right?!
 Asta, you bastard.
 Oh, come on now, Gauche.
 Just cool down a little, okay?
 A Magic Knight needs to  stay calm at all times.
 Well, listen to you.
 Calm, eh? You're right.
 So you finally understand?
 I'll calmly kill you.
 I went too far!
 That hurt, you stupid little brat!
 Wait, wait, wait!  Now's not the time for this!
 We need to find some clues!
 What? As if it'll be that easy!
 The magic mirror that I have Marie  keep with her at all times...
 I wouldn't be able to transmit  to it because of this snow,
 but if I search for the  mana in that mirror...
 I should be able to figure out where she is.
 That's it!
 All right! I may have figured that out, but I'm still killing you.
 I'll kill you while giving thanks.
 I'm going, as well. I'm going to get the  kids from the church and the town back.
 Old Sister, leave this to us.
 No. As much as it pains me to  say it, this old hag will be useful.
 Huh? She's not just an ordinary old lady?
 I'm not going to lose to  you young'uns just yet.
 Asta... Marco's an idiot and Luca's too headstrong, so I'm worried about them...
 What should I do? If something  were to happen to them...
 Get a hold of yourself, Rebecca!
 Take that!
 It'll be fine! I'll get them  back, no matter what!
 They'll laugh at you if you're  all panicky when we get back.
 Y-You're right.
 Let's go.
 Hey, I'm going, too!
 You can't fly on your own either, can you?  Do you want to dangle, like him?
 The town might be attacked again.
 Would you mind staying behind?
 And could you report back  to the Magic Knights?
 I'm counting on you, Asta!
 I have to stay behind with her?
 I'm so happy I made so many friends.
 L-Let's all get along.
 Where am I?
 This isn't the church. What am I doing here?
 Everyone seems out of it. What's wrong?
 Who is that?
 Make sure you stay good boys and  girls with the spell I'm using.
 Did he put a spell on everyone?
 Come to think of it, Brother did say that
 the mirror he gave me would  protect me from magic a little.
 Hang on to this mirror as if it were me.
 So that's why I...
 Looks like my spell on you has been broken.
 I wonder why. You bad little girl...
 We can't be friends if you won't be  a good girl and stay under my spell.
 But you're wrong. Putting someone under  a spell and making them do what you say
 doesn't make them a real friend.
 How could you say something so cruel?
 A friend would never say that!
 Neige...
 I told you not to damage the goods.
 Honestly, you're so hopeless.
 I'm sorry, Baro!
 She's the prize this time. Imagine having that much magic at her age!
 Having this many brats means a big payday!
 That brat barely has any magic.
 I told you to only bring ones  with a lot of magic, Neige!
 Sorry, Baro.
 Just gonna have to throw  trash like this away.
 Sheesh. Stop wasting my time.
 Now, then... Let's draw the magic out of you.
 We're close. The mana's getting stronger.
 Right!
 These enemies must possess  powerful magic. Be on your guard.
 Wait for me, Marie.
 Please be safe, everyone!
 Everyone, please stay calm.  We, the Magic Knights, will find all the kids.
 The Magic Knights!
 Please get my son back!
 What's going on?
 Where are Luca and Marco?
 Well...
 Don't worry. Asta and Gauche  will bring them all back soon.
 Y-Yeah! So don't you worry.
 Also...
 Why's our house broken?
 S-Stupidsta and Gauche will fix  that when they get back, too.
 We should do what we can  to fix it up for now.
 There's snow everywhere inside.
 Oh, I need to contact  the other Magic Knights.
 Magic Knights' Headquarters here, bah-ha!
 Haven't I seen you before?
 A-Are you really from headquarters?
 Bah-ha! It's not my main job, but  Captain Jack ordered me to help out here.
 I've been doing so good lately that they're  letting me take a break from all the battles.
 Or something like that, bah-ha!
 I don't care! We have an emergency!
 There's snow! There's snow in Nean!
 Snow? How romantic!
 Are you stupid?!
 Someone made this snow fall  on the town using magic
 so they could kidnap all the kids here!
 What? You should hurry up and  contact the Magic Knights.
 That's what I'm doing right now!
 R-Right!
 There's nothing to worry  about anymore! Bah-ha!
 Somehow, I'm even more worried now.
 I sense mana in there.
 A cave. That must be where  all the abducted children are!
 That's...
 Gauche, could you let me down a sec?
 Not my problem. I don't care  about anyone besides Marie.
 If you want to go, then jump off.
 Hup!
 Asta! How can you call  yourself a Magic Knight?!
 I don't care what happens to the others,  as long as I can protect Marie.
 On the day that I, a former prisoner, joined the Black Bulls, the captain told me...
 You can just protect whoever  you want to protect.
 And that's exactly what I'll be doing.
 Marco!
 Wake up.
 This is awful. He's covered in  wounds, and he's frostbitten.
 Marco?
 It's no use. He's under a spell and still unconscious.
 All right... Leave it to me!
 What are you—
 Huh? Asta... Sister...
 Are you all right, Marco?
 What was that just now? He erased the magic?
 It hurts...
 Just a second...
 Flame Recovery Magic: Sacred Healing Light.
 It's so warm...
 You're amazing, old lady!  You can even heal wounds?
 What in the world happened?
 I... don't know.
 He's so hurt.
 Marco...
 We have to go save your  sister and the other kids.
 Can you wait in that cave by yourself?
 Huh? No! I'm scared, Asta.
 Stay with me, please.
 What are you talking about?  You're a man, too, aren't you?
 Just this once, I'll let you  borrow my Black Bulls robe!
 As long as you have this on, you'll be fine!
 It's got Magic Knight  courage in it, after all!
 You can wait until we get back, right?
 Yeah!
 But don't forget! I'm only  letting you borrow it!
 You're going to give it back to me later!
 You'll give it back, right?  And don't get any snot on it!
 Y-Yup.
 All right, we have to hurry.  I'm worried about the others.
 It's like a damn maze in here.
 But the mana's getting stronger and stronger.
 Just wait a little longer, Marie.
 Good, good. More, more!
 I'm going to squeeze every last drop of magic out of you brats!
 And done.
 Now, then... Are we going  to use our prize next?
 N-No! S-Stop!
 Please! Let me go!
 You can't defy Baro.
 Just give it up. I'm gonna make  a fortune off of your magic.
 Marie!
 Brother!
 Thank goodness! You're sa—
 What did you do to Marie, you bastards?!
 I-It's an enemy, Baro! He has a Magic Knight robe on!
 Damn it! How'd they find us so quickly?
 Do something! Use your magic, Neige!
 R-Right.

 That guy's too strong. And he's scary!
 Damn it... This isn't what we were told about.
 I only accepted this job because we were told that
 it'd just be draining brats of their magic!
 What's the deal with this guy's magic?!
 What should we do, Baro?
 Shut up, you moron!
 Th-Think! There has to be some way! Something...
 Move an inch, and see what happens to her!
 You bastard!
 What's with that look?
 What are you going to do
 if I get annoyed and put a little  too much strength into my grip?
 Neige, beat him to a pulp—
 Crap!
 Marie!
 Everything's okay now!
 Thank you, Asta!
 Are you okay, Marie?
 Hey!
 Asta!
 You bastard! How dare you  throw something so dangerous?!
 What if it had hit Marie?!
 Wait, wait, wait. This was to save Marie.
 More importantly, what if you had hit Marie?!
 There's no way I'd ever hit her.
 My love for Marie is too great.
 Huh?!
 Brother, please stop!
 Stay away, Marie!
 No!
 These children have had their  magic sucked out of them.
 If left like this, they may never  be able to use magic again.
 Th-Their magic...
 That man was saying how it'd  be worth a lot of money.
 How could you do something so cruel?
 Crap. This is not good. Not good at all.
 Baro?
 We had enough on our hands  with that monster of a guy,
 but now that his friends have shown up, we don't stand a chance!
 This boy...
 What the heck? He doesn't  have any magic at all!
 Unbelievable! I've never  seen trash like you!
 Now that I take a closer look,
 you're just some peon that doesn't  even have a Magic Knight's robe!
 Neige, you take care of  that sister complex freak.
 Huh?
 I guess I'll just have to take  care of this peon myself.
 I won't...
 forgive you!

 Luca... Marco...
 It'll be okay. I'm sure Asta and the  others will bring them back safely.
 Why don't we do a quiz to lighten the mood?
 Huh?
 Then... Where is Asta from?
 H-Hage Village.
 Correct.
 I'll go next.
 How old is Asta?
 Fifteen, right?
 Then when is Asta's birthday?
 October 4th.
 What is Asta's dream?
 Becoming the Wizard King someday... I think.
 You're pretty knowledgeable.
 You, too.
 I really don't want to lose!
 Hey, everyone, bah-ha!
 Oh, I can't hear you. Ready, and... bah-ha!
 Next time, I get to be the star again!

 Black Bulls' Base
 Bah... ha!
 Jeez... The Black Bulls are supposed  to be the closest to Nean.
 So why aren't they responding?
 Bah-ha?
 But the Black Bulls are a  group of misfits, aren't they?
 Bah-ha...
 G-Good evening...
 I'm here to ask for backup.
 Bah... ha?
 Right. I should go. I-I'm not scared or anything,
 but what else can I do if no one's here?
 Actually, it looks like I scared  off the Black Bulls, bah-ha!
 Instead,
 I guess I'll just go ask at the garden of  beautiful women, the Blue Rose Knights.
 So why am I wasting any more time... here?
 The moon's beautiful, isn't it?
 Bah-ha!
 I'm Gordon,
 I'm Gordon, but you can call me Don.
 Wait...
 Stop! I'm no one suspicious!
 You're Sekke Bronzazza from
 You're Sekke Bronzazza from the Green Praying Mantises, right?
 You're Sekke Bronzazza from the Green Praying Mantises, right? Let's be friends.
 Y-Yikes...
 I haven't seen you since the Magic Knights' Entrance Exam...
 That look... He's going to kill me!
 Would you like to join me for tea?
 S-Stop! Stay back!
 Bah-ha...
 Bah-ha!
 Another freak just showed up!
 Shut up!
 Damn it. And I was sleeping so well...
 ""Bah-ha, bah-ha, ha-bah, ha-bah...""
 Do you have any idea what time it is?
 The Black Bulls' captain?
 Huh?
 Bah-ha...
 I apologize for coming by so late. I've come to ask the Black Bulls for backup—
 Who the hell are you?
 Huh? Are you here about my tab at the pub?
 Ha-bah?! N-No! I'm from the Magic Knights—
 I haven't been to any Magic Knights' pub.
 But the town of Nean is—
 I just paid off my tab in Nean!
 Bah-ha?! Let's just drop  the tabs for a second...
 You're telling me to pay them again?!
 What?!
 Would you like some sugar in your tea?
 What the hell is wrong with this squad?!
 I knew I should've asked  the Blue Rose Knights!
 Bah-ha!
 Neige! Don't just stand there! Do something!
 Go!
 You just don't give up.
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain.
 Done already?
 Then die, you wussy loser.
 No... S-Stay back!
 Snow Binding Spell: Snow Lime Rock!
 I-I did it!
 Brother...
 That's not good. His mirror's been sealed.
 Gauche! I'll save you!
 Save me? Stop trying to act cool  in front of Marie, damn it!
 What?!
 You fool! This is no time to act tough!
 Shut up! I'll take care of  him myself! We will, that is.
 Neige, behind you!
 Why... is there another one?
 Mirror Magic: Real Double!
 Real Double is a spell that summons my  other self from within the mirror world.
 I'd already activated the  spell before you caught me.
 Th-That's awesome! You're amazing, Gauche!
 That young criminal...
 He made snow fall over a wide area.  He has a tremendous amount of magic.
 But Gauche has magic equal  to his, and most importantly,
 he's excellent at fighting with magic.
 He's strong, after all.
 Though his glare and personality  are the absolute worst.
 What's Neige doing?! He's so useless!
 Damn it... My body won't move.  There has to be some way...
 I know... If I use that—
 Why did you do something so awful?!
 Stealing other people's magic...
 How would you feel if  someone did that to you?!
 Like I care, you moron!
 It doesn't matter to me if someone  else dies or loses their magic!
 You bastard!
 Stop!
 This isn't enough pain to  make up for what you did!
 You're gonna pay for this, starting now!
 That's right. This scum isn't even  worth striking with your fist.
 More importantly, we have to  do something about those kids.
 Hey, tell us how to give  them their magic back!
 At least let me go! Then I'll tell—
 Don't mess with me!
 He's rotten to the bone.
 Asta, first, undo the spell  that's on the children.
 As for you, don't try anything funny.
 Like I could right now...
 Mud Magic: Mud Men.
 Where am I?
 Mama? Papa?
 My feet hurt!
 Sister!
 There, there. Come here, all of you.
 Asta!
 Luca! Everything's going to be okay.
 Hurry up and treat Marie's wounds, you old hag.
 You don't have to tell me to  do it, you sister complex punk.
 Flame Recovery Magic: Sacred Healing Light.
 It's so warm!
 Hey, you brats in the middle.
 Make some room for Marie!  That way she'll get better faster.
 Oh, stop it, Brother!
 Bless you, Marie. You're as kind as an angel.
 Angels belong in the middle!
 The magic will work just the  same wherever she stands.
 Marie, want some dried tatoes? You'll feel better!
 Marie's not going to eat your weird food!
 Hey! It's what Hage is famous for!
 Asta, you grew up at the  church in Hage, didn't you?
 Huh? How did you know that?
 Sister Lily came to our church to train once.
 She told me about you then.
 Heavens me! You know Sister Lily?
 She was a fine young woman.
 Isn't she?!
 Wait, so Sister was talking  about me? What did she say?!
 That you were a small and noisy child.
 But she also said this...
 After I finish this, all I  have left are the windows.
 Hey, you're not going to last if you  work this hard from day one.
 This is nothing at all. I know someone  who works even harder than this.
 He can't use magic at all,
 but he says he's going to be the Wizard King  someday and trains every single day.
 The Wizard King? If he  doesn't have any magic,
 he probably won't even be  able to join the Magic Knights.
 Yes, you're right. But still, he always  says, ""Not yet! I'm not done yet!""
 He works really hard.
 Which is why... Not yet! I'm not done yet!
 She said you were a hard  worker with a strong heart
 who wouldn't give up in the face of adversity,  and that she was very proud of you.
 Looks like all of your hard work paid off.
 But I've still got a long way to go!
 I'm going to become the  Wizard King, no matter what!
 I'm not so sure about that.
 I will not give up!
 Sister, I'm never, never, never, never,  ever going to give up on you, either!
 Marie told me that you  were the one who hit her.
 The only way to atone for that is death.
 Stop that, Gauche!
 Brother! I'm okay!
 My injuries are all healed now, so let him go!
 No, I can't.
 I will eliminate anyone who might hurt Marie  now, before they have the chance!
 Asking them how to return the  children's magic is more important.
 You two. Why did you do this?
 These children are the  future of this kingdom.
 They're the three-leaf sprouts  that grace this nation!
 I just wanted friends...
 It hurts... What should I do, Baro?
 Stop your whining, you useless little brat!
 It hurts, damn it! Why is this happening to me?!
 It's her. It's all her fault. She tricked me.
 I thought it was a good way to make money!
 Hurry up and get back here, you moron!
 Wow!
 That's...
 There she is.
 Took you long enough, for someone who travels with spatial magic!
 They got in the way of our  magic collecting! Help us!
 Jeez, you're so whiny. But you  get a pat on the back this time.
 Asta!
 She's from the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 I'm so happy we get to see  each other again so soon!
 It's that crazy lady!
 What? There was an incident in Nean?
 You should've mentioned  that earlier, you dumbass!
 But I've been saying that from the start!
 Quit making excuses!
 What?!
 You're asking me for reinforcements, but...
 Nean, huh... I've always wanted to go there once. But now's not the time for that.
 I dunno what's going through  these guys' heads,
 and I sure can't be bothered, so I don't know what to tell you.
 My friend's in trouble. I want to  save him with my curse magic...
 Are these guys really Magic Knights?!
 Everyone, stay calm.  Please get inside the church.
 Marco...
 Luca...
 I-It's okay. They'll be home soon.
 Despite how they look, Asta and Gauche are Magic Knights.
 And we'll be getting reinforcements  from headquarters soon.
 Wow!
 Really?
 I think I'll make some dinner  while we wait. Help me out.
 Okay!
 Reinforcements are coming, right?
 Hey...
 I came here because you called me  with the magic transmission item,
 but you haven't gathered that much magic yet.
 It's all their fault!
 Well, it's not like I care.
 All of you stay right here. You hear me?
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun... The terrorist  group that attacked the capital?
 That's them!
 So basically, you're the one who  put Marie through all this.
 I'll kill you!
 Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!
 Could you not interrupt our moving reunion?
 While I'm at it, maybe I'll dissect you all!
 What is that ominous magic?
 Be careful, Gauche, Granny!
 I heard she blocked the  Silver captain's attack, too!
 Here I come!
 Incoming!
 Not yet! I'm not done yet!
 Anti-magic is no problem  at all if it can't hit me!
 Impudent pest!
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!
 She deflected all of it!
 That's some fine magic,
 but it gets refracted inside Salaman,  so there's really no point.
 Things might be a bit different  if you have something stronger!
 Gauche!
 Here you go, Asta!
 This is nothing!
 Gotcha!
 I can't move...
 You look just like a normal human.
 I want to know all about you!
 Rawr!
 Ow! That hurt! And you're scary!
 Well, your blood's normal.
 Next, I'm just going to take your pinky nail.
 Stop it!
 Flame Magic: Brilliant Flame Cross!
 Aw. You melted my little Salaman.
 That's enough of that! I won't let you have this boy!
 Hey, don't get in the way.
 Th-That's amazing...
 Thanks, Granny! You're super strong!
 I may be old, but I'm a former Magic Knight!
 I'm Theresa the Crimson She-Leopard!
 Former Magic Knight
 Theresa the Crimson She-Leopard
 Huh?!
 She's suddenly all pumped up?!
 Wait... Former Magic Knight?!
 Crimson... Then do you  know Captain Fuegoleon?
 Oh, Fueggy? Sure.
 ""Fueggy""?!
 When I served at the palace,  I was his tutor.
 Fueggy, your mana's getting unsteady.
 Y-Yes, ma'am!
 Your enemies won't wait for you in battle.
 Concentrate! And remain calm at all times!
 Yes, ma'am!
 He was such a snot-nosed brat,  but he grew up quite well.
 I seriously can't picture that.
 But Granny, Captain Fuegoleon was...
 By them.
 Yeah, I know.
 We'll catch this one, no matter what.
 Do something about this, you old hag!
 What are you doing over there, you sister complex failure?
 You stupid old hag...
 Three against one, huh?
 That doesn't look so good.
 Hey, you.
 I'll back you up with my mud magic.  Just fix my body so I can move.
 You can do that, right?
 Well... There is a way, but are you sure?
 Of course I am! Anything's fine, just do it!
 Okay, I'll do it, then. But are you sure?
 Yeah!
 Are you really sure?
 I told you, I'm sure! Just shut up and do it!
 Hey! What are you two whispering about?!
 H-Hurry up and heal me!  And give me some money!
 Then I'll help you out.
 Yeah, right. Once I'm freed and paid,  I'm getting the hell outta here!
 Okay. In that case... Hup!
 What is she...
 Baro?!
 What the heck?!
 What is that?! His magic is swelling!
 Whoopsie! Looks like I messed up a little.
 He can move now, and his magic's recharged,
 but looks like his personality  wandered off somewhere.
 Protect the children, Gauche! Asta!
 Right!
 Let's go, Marie.
 B-Brother?
 Go? But what about everyone else?
 It doesn't matter! It's too dangerous  for you to be around that monster!
 What?!
 That fool.
 I'm going to take you home  for sure this time, Asta!

 What the heck's going on?!
 We can't handle something that big!
 First of all, we have to  get the kids out of here.
 Kids, take turns riding out of here on that!
 Okay!
 This is cool!
 It's so warm!
 It'll take at least ten or twenty  minutes to get them all out of here.
 We have to hold this thing back until then.
 I won't let you get near them!

 B-Baro? What's wrong?
 Y-You don't know who I am?
 Why... did you save me?
 You haven't taken responsibility  for any of this yet!
 I'm not letting you die until you do!
 Also, what's your problem?  You're trying to kill your own brother?!
 You moron!
 Looks like my sword's working,  so I'm just gonna quickly take care of—
 Now your anti-magic won't be  able to defeat him so easily!
 The dark magic item I just injected  him with eats the subject's life force
 and produces an explosion of magical power!
 How could you do that?!
 There's no end to this!
 You're wide open, Asta!
 Take that!
 No!
 Granny?
 Aw, you got in the way again!  Quit butting in, would ya?
 I'm not interested in an old  lady whose magic's all dried up.
 Looks like you've got a mouth  on you, whippersnapper.
 It's true that as you get older, the magic  you can generate internally weakens.
 But the power to work with  the mana that dwells
 in nature can be increased at any age.
 I have years of experience and technique.  I won't lose to a youngster like you!
 Don't you dare underestimate us old hags!
 Jeez, you're an annoying  old lady, aren't you?
 Don't blame me if you kick the bucket today.
 Go ahead and try it!
 That being said,
 I can't fight well while protecting  the kids as they escape.
 Damn it. This is only going to get worse.
 Curse that Gauche! How could  he run off like that?!
 That fool!
 Brother, go back!
 No! I'm taking you back into town.
 Please, go back!
 No! Not only does my magic  not work on that woman,
 but an insanely powerful  magical monster appeared, too.
 You'll be in danger if I fight that thing!
 But everyone else...
 I don't care what happens to the others,  as long as you're all right.
 Yeah... Who cares about anyone else?
 The House of Adlai is a distinguished  noble family that anyone would envy.
 Little Gauche looks as  dignified as his father!
 And little Marie is as  beautiful as her mother!
 So, about you helping me with my business...
 What? Mother and Father are dead?
 Yes. They were attacked by some  robbers after leaving my office.
 It's written in their will that they left
 their fortune and everything  they owned to me.
 Every last thing.
 You're lying!
 Wait, did you guys—
 Silence!
 What's that look for?
 What an impudent brat.
 Get out.
 Bubby...
 Don't worry, Marie.
 I'll protect Marie, no matter what it takes!
 So as I was saying...
 Hey! You again?!
 Marie is everything to me!
 Is it good?
 Yup!
 As long as Marie is smiling, I don't need anything else.
 Give me all the cash you have.
 I-I'm a noble!
 And? Nobles should help out the needy.
 Only Marie...
 Stop right there!
 You'll be paying for all of your crimes!
 You think I care?!
 You punk!
 Marie...
 Like I care about other people!
 Hi-yah!
 I hate having a big brother who's so pathetic!
 D'oh!
 It's true that a lot of people  did some awful things to us.
 But Sister and the kids at  the church are different!
 The only reason I wasn't lonely when you  weren't with me was because of them!
 That's how you became a Magic Knight, too!
 Everyone's lives are connected!
 We're who we are because they're here!
 Brother!
 Besides, it's your job as a  Magic Knight to protect everyone.
 I'm really proud that you're a Magic Knight!
 Please just be the cool  big brother I'm proud of!
 Marie...
 Hey! Over here!
 Marco!
 Thank goodness! You're okay!
 Sister and Asta saved me.
 That's so like them!
 Brat, that robe...
 Asta lent it to me so I wouldn't feel lonely  while he went to go save everyone else.
 He said it had the courage  of a Magic Knight in it.
 Brother, I'll wait here with Marco. Please go save everyone else!
 I'll protect Marie! Leave it to me!
 You'd better mean that, you stupid little brat.
 I'll make you pay if anything happens to Marie.
 Um...
 Brother!
 Marco!
 Marie!
 Everyone!
 I'm so glad you're safe!
 Yeah!
 We managed to get away with Sister's magic.
 Asta protected us, but that  monster's really strong!
 It'll be okay! My brother's  going to fight with them.
 My brother's a Magic Knight  just like Asta, after all.
 Just like Asta?
 So he must be really strong!
 Yeah!
 Marie, make sure you stay hidden.
 Yup!
 Brother, do your best!
 Do your best!
 Asta this, Asta that...
 What's so great about that shrimp, anyway?
 The captain and the other squad  members wouldn't shut up about him,
 but he immediately got caught by that woman!
 Whatever. I'm sure he and that  old hag gave up and ran away.
 When you get down to it, people only care about themselves!
 Not yet... I'm not done yet!
 Jeez, you're so stubborn.
 Why don't you stop protecting them  and let me catch you already?
 Stop protecting them? I'm a Magic Knight!
 Not a chance! Even if it kills me!
 Is he... actually that stupid?
 Stop protecting them? I'm a Magic Knight!
 Not a chance! Even if it kills me!
 And I'm not going to die until  I become the Wizard King!
 Asta! On your right!
 Crap!
 You yelled something stupid  like ""I'm not going to die,""
 and then you actually almost died.
 Gauche! Why'd you run off like that?
 Shut up!
 I didn't run. I only helped Marie escape.
 He finally came back, that fool.
 I'll deal with you myself!
 Wait!
 You joining in isn't going to help!
 Whatever. I'm going to fight...  for the sake of Marie's love!
 And so she'll say I'm cool!
 Real Double!
 Double Refrain!
 Whoa, cool!
 This monster... Magic keeps bubbling up  from it, and it regenerates immediately.
 It's no use!
 My magic isn't even touching that woman.
 I haven't been this incompatible  with an opponent since the captain.
 Should I use my trump card?
 No... No matter how strong my  mirror magic becomes, it won't help.
 Gauche!
 How lame...
 I thought you came to help! What are you doing charging in all by yourself?!
 We're supposed to be a team!
 I protect you! You protect me!
 Then we'll be able to fight forever!
 An epic strategy, if I do say so myself!
 What kind of half-baked strategy is that?
 This guy really is an idiot.
 Come to think of it, he was  pretty half-baked, too.
 You really want to keep going?  You're not gonna be able to run.
 My sister's waiting for me...
 Oh, yeah?
 Well, if she's that important,  join my squad and support her.
 What are you talking about?
 I'm an escaped convict!
 Yeah? And?
 And? I don't trust others,  and I only think about my sister.
 That's fine.
 You just protect what you want to protect.
 Someday, that'll help somebody out.
 Captain, did you know this  would happen someday?
 Take that!
 Granny, how many kids are left?
 Just a few more!
 I guess I don't have a choice.
 Marie will be sad if you all die.
 I'll protect you.
 Did Gauche just...
 What are you acting all tough for?
 We're teammates! What else would we do?
 You stupid little brat! You need to  learn how to talk to your seniors!
 And something's shining over there.
 Huh?
 This is...
 Just like that one time!
 There it is!
 Aw, man! Even that didn't work?
 Wait, what was that? A flying  anti-magic slash attack?
 How did you do it? How did you do it?
 The only way to defeat that monster
 is to hit it with so many attacks at once that it doesn't have time to regenerate.
 The most effective strike was  the slash Asta just hit it with,
 but he can't launch enough of them.
 What would happen if I used my magic on someone else?
 Because Gauche had always preferred  to act alone and didn't trust others,
 he'd never thought of using his  magic to support someone else.
 But due to his past failures and his  reluctant acknowledgment of Asta,
 he was able to create a spell that was
 fundamentally similar,  yet completely different,
 and engraved a new page in his grimoire.
 But I won't be able to activate this  spell with the magic I have now.
 Hey, old hag!
 Buy me a little time!
 Please!
 You need to learn how to treat old hags.
 I'll only last a minute, so make it fast!
 Leftover magic like that  isn't going to work at all.
 Anyway, Asta! Do that thing again!
 You don't have to tell me!  If I could, I would!
 Aw. How boring.
 I have no choice. I've been hiding  this, but I'll have to use it now.
 Asta!
 Yes?
 Look at me!
 I'll use the magic accumulated in  the mirror magic item in my left eye
 to activate the new spell.

 Baro...
 Jeez, you're so annoying.
 How long are you gonna keep crying, Neige?
 Here, you can have this.
 Thanks, Baro.
 Baro, I won't forgive her for  turning you into this monster.
 But the one I can't forgive most of all
 is myself for leaving everything to  him and just doing what he said!
 Just as you said, I haven't taken  responsibility for anything.
 So I'm going to pay for both of our crimes.
 Yeah. And when you're done  with that, let's be buddies.
 You can use really cool magic,  so you'd be really popular!
 Thank—
 That light...
 What is this immense magic?
 I've never felt something this huge—
 I didn't... see a thing...

 A new enemy? Are they attacking  everything in sight?

 They got what they deserved.

 Leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun Licht
 Licht.
 No way...
 A four-leaf clover grimoire...  Just like Yuno's?
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Marie's in Danger
 Marie's in Danger.
 All right, one, two, three!
 Marie! Are you an angel?!
 I can do anything when Marie's around!
 But there are times where I must steel  my heart and decline Marie's wishes.
 For example!
 Brother, go back and save  Asta and the others!
 No! Going back would put you in danger!
 Brother! I want to eat some  hot, extra-cheesy doria!
 No! Eating that would put  your tongue in danger!
 You'll burn it.
 Brother, doesn't lying  out in the sun feel nice?
 No! If you're in the sun too long,  your skin will be in danger!
 UV rays are a fearsome enemy!
 Brother, show me a really cool spell!
 No... Just kidding.
 Marie, look at me.
 Mirage Brigade!
 You're amazing, Brother!
 No... Now I'm... in danger.
 Brother? Brother? Brother?
 That's the guy who was at the  Eye of the Midnight Sun hideout!
 You're the one who attacked the Clover  Kingdom and did that to Captain Fuegoleon...
 I'll make you regret that!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Granny! Get a grip!
 Don't you dare die, you old hag!
 You're going to make Marie sad if you die!
 I wouldn't like it very much, either!
 T-Take care of the children for me...
 In any battlefield... the victims  were... always the weak.
 It was always the innocent children.
 It's because I wanted to protect the children
 that I left the battlefield  and became a sister.
 Granny!
 What are you talking about?
 All of you were born sinners.
 What?!
 You poor thing... Sally, look at how much they've hurt you.
 Master Licht...
 Rest, my child.
 Valtos.
 Yes, sir.
 See you later, Asta.
 You belong to me.
 I never want to see her again!
 Forgive me, my lord. All this  because I let her go alone...
 I never imagined all of this would happen.
 There's no need for you to feel responsible.
 I'm sure they used some underhanded methods.
 Who are you calling underhanded?!
 Look at what you did to all  those innocent children!
 She mentioned earlier that the victims  on the battlefield are always the weak.
 That is incorrect.
 The victims are the strong.
 Envied, feared, discriminated  against, persecuted, and...
 stolen from.
 What is he talking about?
 That is why we will not  forgive the Clover Kingdom.
 This time, we will destroy you  and create our own kingdom.
 What the hell are you even talking about?!
 You're the ones who attacked first, you jerk!
 Shut your filthy mouth.
 You're an eyesore.
 Why does someone like you have that grimoire?
 Grimoire?
 Damn it... I can't see his attacks at all!
 They hit me straight-on  at an incredible speed!
 What do I...
 This is the only way.
 If I use my sword as a shield and charge  at him, I can avoid a fatal injury!
 I'm not done yet!
 That won't work.
 I'll be taking that grimoire back.
 I'm gonna...
 di—
 Seriously?
 Captain Yami! What are you doing here?
 Why am I here? Well, obviously...
 I'm a little lost. Give me  some directions, damn it.
 Light Magic vs. Dark Magic
 Captain, you were lost?!
 Of course not, you moron.
 I was joking, dumbass.
 What?!
 We're Magic Knights. Of course  we're going to show up.
 Everyone back at the base was useless,  so I decided to come myself.
 I'll kill them all later.
 What the heck are they doing when  we're in this much trouble?!
 He dragged me out of bed,  and now we're in this mess!
 By the way, didn't I tell  you to take the day off?
 Want me to give you a permanent vacation?
 Ow, ow, ow, ow!
 So, what's his deal?
 Apparently he's the leader of  the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Th-The Eye of the Midnight Sun?!
 Oh?
 I thought he'd be some big, burly guy who could eat a cow in a single gulp,
 but he's just a scrawny-ass beanpole.
 Um, I'm pretty sure muscles  don't really matter.
 What's with that guy's creepy,  infinite amount of magic?!
 Not to mention, he uses light magic?
 That's a super rare magic  that only a few people
 throughout the history of the  Clover Kingdom have ever used!
 Without a doubt, he's super  dangerous! I wanna go home!
 That's the Black Bulls' captain.
 Shall I summon the Third Eye?
 There's no need.
 I've always wanted to fight him, since he uses dark magic.
 Finral, please get the kids and  everyone else back to town.
 Sure, leave it to me!
 What are you going to do?
 I can still fight!
 I finally get a chance to see Captain Yami  in action! There's no way I'm leaving!
 Gauche and, uh... you there! Can you walk?
 More importantly, get to  the old hag! Hurry up!
 Got it!
 I've been around longer than you, y'know...
 All right, Yami. I'm leaving the rest to you.
 Hey. You better come back.
 Gulp...
 I was planning to just  stay out of harm's way.
 You know, I think I'm running low on magic...
 Like, for real!
 What do you mean? I'm for real, too.
 Of course you are...
 Huh?
 The hell do you think  you're doing to my ride?
 Ride?!
 Yeesh! I don't have enough  lives to stick around here!
 Well, see you, Yami!
 You better come back, damn it!
 So cool! How'd you stop that?
 What's up with that sword?!
 Shut up, brat.
 This is a weapon called a ""katana""  from my homeland, the Land of the Sun.
 And that was—
 Like I have time to explain all this  right now. Besides, it's a pain.
 Just watch!
 Light Magic: Light Swords of Conviction.
 Awesome!
 He's boosting his physical abilities  with reinforcing magic
 and cutting my light magic with  a sword cloaked in dark magic.
 But that's not all.
 How about this, then?
 So this is the power of the  great Magic Knight heretic.
 Huh?
 Hey, have I met you somewhere before?
 I'm pretty sure I don't know  anyone who uses light magic.
 Who the hell are you?
 And what's so fun about all of this?
 Let me tell you a fable.
 Long ago, in a certain village, there lived a people with very strong magic.
 They were loved by mana.
 They changed the weather  and manipulated ley lines.
 They had power to rival the gods.
 The humans from outside the  village worshipped them as such.
 However, gradually, the humans  grew to fear their power.
 They envied it and wanted it.
 They tricked them, massacred them, and stole their powers.
 What kind of story was that?
 What's that got to do with you?
 Planning to become a bard or something?
 All right, I've got a little story, too.
 In a certain place, there was a pure young man.
 His folks were fishermen, and they started  sending him out to fish from a young age.
 And then he got shipwrecked...
 Augh!
 Seriously?
 ...and washed ashore in a strange country.
 Who the hell is this?
 He's wearing grass sandals.
 You can't be serious!
 Since his race and culture were different,  he went through some nasty stuff there.
 But...
 He kicked all their asses and  became the boss of a group.
 The end!
 Well? What'd you think of my response fable?
 Well, it's half of my life, actually.
 You bastard! You dare mock Master Licht?!
 Shut up! Your face is scary!
 Why are there lines on your face?!
 You're bringing that up now?!
 He got faster.
 As a foreigner, I suppose my  story had nothing to do with you.
 Would you mind stepping off the stage, then?
 Captain Yami!
 I wonder how long you can  avoid a fatal blow?
 Are you the guy who took out Fuegoleon?
 I am.
 Although I laid my plans carefully  and had him walk into a trap.
 Yeah, I figured.
 You'd never take down that King  of Hardnoses with stuff like this.
 Dark Magic:
 Dark Cloaked
 Lightless Slash!
 Master Licht!
 A-Amazing... He's so frickin' cool!
 Trap, eh? I'm sure you wouldn't  have been able to win
 without doing something underhanded.
 How dare you?!
 This time, come right at me.
 I'll show you the true power  of a Magic Knight Captain!
 Hey, brat. Were you watching that?
 Y-Yes, sir!
 Good. Now try the same thing.
 Yes, sir!
 Wait... Like I could actually do that!
 Of course I can't!
 Oh? Who do you think you're talking to?
 Huh?
 I told you to do it, so do it.
 Ow, ow, ow, that really hurts! Ow, ow, ow!
 That'll make you a bigger man.
 Not only did he manage to stop  all of Master Licht's attacks,
 he even managed to counter.
 The Black Bulls' captain...
 Does his strength actually  rival the Wizard King's?!
 I see... So this is dark magic.
 Light Recovery Magic:  Healing Light Particles.
 He can use recovery magic, too?
 I haven't seen it in person much,
 but apparently, guys loved by  mana can use all sorts of magic.
 It's especially rare for an  attack-type to also be able to heal.
 Anyway, get ready.
 He was actually serious!
 No, really! I can't!
 Not in the middle of fighting!
 Not to mention, I don't have any magic!
 I don't mean the last attack I did.
 I'm saying do the thing before that, idiot.
 And I can't block attacks that I can't see!
 You're hopeless.
 I'll explain it just this once. You'll have to pay me 500 yuls later.
 He's charging?!
 The reason I've been able  to react to the attacks
 is because of something called ""ki""  from back in my homeland.
 Ki? Not mana?
 Yeah.
 Ki
 People looking at you, the sound of their breathing,
 their smell, the motions of their muscles,
 the vague sense that they're there...
 Ki is the blanket term for all of the  different types of life energy
 the human body emits.
 I read that ki and predicted  his next move, then made mine.
 You've done that before, haven't you?
 Come to think of it...
 When I do it, I combine it with  magic and muscle, and fight that way.
 I guess it's like being a magic  swordsman or something.
 Muscles! So that's why your neck's  so thick, Captain Yami!
 Like you can talk, kid.
 He has the nerve to converse during a battle.
 The insolence...
 He's just full of surprises.
 To think he could keep up  with this speed, as well.
 I cannot allow him to trouble  you any further, Master Licht.
 I know this is impertinent of me, but would you allow me to assist you?
 Thank you, Valtos. You're always so helpful.
 In that case, that boy...  Would you capture him?
 You may injure him slightly if need be.
 An easy task.
 Huh?
 That was close!
 Perfect timing. Practice on that  scrawny dude with the slanty eyes.
 Huh?! On the scrawny dude  with the slanty eyes?
 That's too sudden! Of course I can't!
 Where I come from, we've got this saying...
 ""A warrior never goes back on his word.""
 You said you were going to  become the Wizard King, didn't you?
 Surpass your limits. Right here, right now.
 There's no other way.
 Yes, sir!
 I don't get it at all, but...
 For starters, concentrate... Concentrate!
 Someone with no magic like you  could never stop my attacks.
 You're there!
 I didn't stop all of it.
 Wrong.
 You can't fool me, kid.
 You just reacted to your ears that time.
 That ain't ki.
 Use all five senses, and sense it  with your whole body, you moron!
 With my whole body?
 Yeah. You can't just rely  on your ears or your eyes.
 Visualize something halfway between  instinct and a prediction.
 If you don't do it right, I'll kill you!
 That's insane.
 But I think I kinda get it.
 Not just my ears, not just my eyes...
 Then... I'm just going to reset everything.
 Concentrate...
 You're there!
 Wha—
 I did it!
 I did it, Captain Yami!
 Wow, you actually managed to do it? Talk about creepy, you weirdo.
 What?!
 Valtos...
 How dare you... harm Valtos?!
 I cannot allow people like  you to harm my comrades
 ever again!
 What's your deal? You're the ones who started this!
 The path this spell traces  resembles the motions of a whip.
 Can you predict its movements?
 It's said that whips were used to  punish criminals, once upon a time.
 That makes it a perfect fit for you two!
 Light Creation Magic: Light Whip of Judgment!
 It's useless to struggle!
 The cave!
 That nutcase has gone ballistic!
 Oh, dear... I held back most of my magic,
 but it's all really too fragile...
 Both this world and you fools.
 You're amazing, Master Licht! Your strength is practically divine!
 If you felt like it, Master Licht, the Magic  Knights would be no more than infants!
 What?!
 The leader of the Eye of the  Midnight Sun... Licht, was it?
 Talk about a huge forehead.
 I guess you'd expect that  from a light magic user.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The leader of the Eye of  the Midnight Sun, Licht.
 Asta was no match for his  overwhelming magical powers.
 The one who came to Asta's rescue
 was none other than the captain  of the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.
 In a breathless battle between  light magic and dark magic,
 Asta went beyond his limits and  closed in for his counterattack.
 But...
 How dare you... harm Valtos?!
 I cannot allow people like  you to harm my comrades

 The Light of Judgment
 If you concentrate like that, you can  sense the ki of natural objects, too.
 That way, you'll never get killed by stuff like falling rocks.
 Ki is awesome! Hooray for ki!
 Ki is the best!
 Who do you think you are?
 All right!
 Now take it up a notch and go after the  white-haired dude with the round eyebrows!
 What?!
 Actually, I think I could do that right now.
 All right! Because of my ki, I'm enthusiastic, energetic, and confident!
 Hope you're ready, Round Brows!
 Actually, scratch that.
 What?!
 I told him that I'd show him the  power of a captain, so I'll do it.
 Plus, if you did it, you'd die.
 But then what am I supposed to  do with all this extra energy?!
 Not my problem.
 You can tackle that scrawny line-faced dude.
 Now, then...
 It's been a while since I've let loose.
 Dark Magic:
 Dark Cloaked
 Lightless Slash!
 As I thought...
 My magic is being drawn in.
 So this is the power of dark magic.
 But...
 Now that I know that, it'll be  impossible for you to get me.
 Hey, you were in the middle  of some weird story,
 but that wasn't the end of it, was it?
 That grimoire means you're a citizen  of the Clover Kingdom, right?
 Why attack your own country?
 You're wide open.
 He left himself wide open  so I'd let my guard down...
 Yami Sukehiro.
 You are a worthy foe.
 Answer me. What's your real goal here?
 Since you're a foreigner, I'm sure  you've noticed them, too.
 The distortions in this country.
 Some are on the brink of  death from starvation,
 but others have so much excess  food that they throw it away.
 People are ranked by how much  or how little magic they have,
 but some have great magic, yet are  discriminated against for reasons of birth.
 Some are hurt in the name of justice  because they were born in another country.
 We were born from these distortions...
 In order to correct them.
 I'm not seeing the point here.
 Aren't you trying to do the same  thing these distorted people do?
 Are you sane?
 Perfectly sane.
 Let me answer your sins with sin.
 So you're gonna have it  your way, no matter what.
 I like guys like that.
 But...
 I hate your guts!
 Wh-What's with this battle?
 So this is the captain's
 full power...
 I don't have any magic. Can I  surpass them, even if I train?
 This guy, Yuno, and the Wizard King...
 To think that he has enough power to  go head to head with Master Licht...
 Master Licht! Please allow me to assist you!
 Hey, brat.
 That was close!
 Why are you wimping out, you dumbass?
 I left that scrawny guy to you.
 I don't give guys jobs they can't do.
 Do something about him in your own way.
 Yes, sir!
 That's right... I'm going to become  the Wizard King, no matter what.
 I don't have time to get depressed.
 All right, let's do this!
 First, I'll become the guy who beats you!
 You won't get me twice.
 Spatial Magic: Myriad Black.
 You may be able to see what's coming,  but can you block all of these?
 One of them got through...
 This will go on forever...
 Until you can't move anymore!
 You dared defy Master Licht  despite having no magic.
 You will pay with your life!
 Damn it... I don't think I'm going  to last until he runs out of magic.
 Even if I manage to repel his attacks,  at this rate, he's going to beat me.
 Calm down and think... Do this my own way...
 You threw away your only weapons?
 Have you lost your mind?!
 In that case, I'll take you  out with an extra-big one!
 He jumped into my space?!
 You just punched him in the face! You're hilarious, kid!
 You let your guard down again.
 That'd be you.
 My attack was absorbed?
 And I can't move...
 Dark Magic: Black Hole, and then...
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked
 Black Blade!
 Captain Yami!
 Well done, brat!
 You got me.
 It's probably within five meters.  The range is definitely limited,
 but to think there was a magic
 that could absorb my own magic  and stop me from moving...
 Dark magic is amazing.
 The one attribute that's the  natural enemy of my light magic.
 However, dark magic is extremely slow.
 Light has absolute speed, making them polar opposites there, as well.
 That's why you cloaked  your weapon in darkness
 and created a combat style that uses  reinforcement magic to compensate.
 Correct!
 Why does it sound like he's bragging?!
 By the way, what's up? You can  use recovery magic, can't you?
 So hurry up and heal.
 But while you're healing yourself,  I'm going to get real close
 and chop you up even more.
 I'll admit it. You're the second person  I've met with the power to defeat me.
 But I sadly cannot waste my time with you.
 Huh? What was that, punk?
 And whaddaya mean, the second?
 I still have an ultimate enemy left who  inflicted this unhealable wound on me,
 the Wizard King, Julius Novachrono.
 This is currently my greatest magic.
 Speed you cannot avoid...
 A spell with such a wide range and  high output that pulling it in
 with that spell you used won't do any good.
 You will meet your end the moment I  release this, Captain of the Black Bulls.
 Like hell he will!
 Quit underestimating Captain Yami!
 Your face is stupid!
 Yeah, that's not good.  That's some insane magic.
 What?!
 Boy. You will also be punished for hurting Valtos, and return that grimoire.
 That's definitely a four-leaf for you...  His magical abilities are off the charts.
 Unless I catch him by surprise,  he'll just dodge any slash at light speed.
 What should I do?
 I'll leave that up to the me  of five seconds from now!
 Papa!
 Mama!
 I was so scared!
 There, there...
 Are you hurt?
 That should be everybody.
 Don't you dare die, you old hag!
 Hey, wake up, old hag!
 You're supposed to be some  immortal monster hag!
 Sister!
 N-No... Why?
 Gauche, you're hurt really badly, too,  so you should worry about your own—
 Shut up!
 Uh... I'm the one with seniority here, you know!
 Gauche's treatments will be done soon.
 Huh?
 Well, all of his wounds just  barely missed his vital points.
 So he was lucky?
 I'm not sure. That just seems...
 Then hurry up and treat the old hag, not me!
 O-Of course.
 Old hag! Wake up already! Old hag—
 Tone it down...
 I can hear you, idiot.
 Old hag!
 Sister!
 Take my magic...
 You're going to save them, aren't you?
 Asta and the others...
 I never said I'd...
 You changed... after meeting him.
 I'm counting on you, Gauche.
 Old hag!
 You're joking, right?
 You said you could die?
 Bring her back to life!
 B-But...
 Do something!
 But...
 Marie's going to be sad, damn it!
 She's alive.
 Huh?
 She's not dead.
 You old hag! Stop being so misleading!
 I'm a monster hag, remember?
 I won't kick the bucket so easily.
 Relax and get over there,  you sister complex freak.
 Take my magic, too!
 Mine, too!
 Mine, too!
 Please save Asta!
 Please use my magic, too.
 You...
 I'm very sorry for being  violent toward your sister.
 I wouldn't be of any help if I went.
 Please take care of Asta.
 Brother.
 See? Everyone lives by supporting each other.
 Marie...
 You just protect what you want to protect.
 Someday, that'll help somebody out.
 I know what I have to do now.
 Finral!
 Erk...
 Take me back to that cave!
 S-Seriously?
 And I'm your senior, damn it!
 Actually, even if we go back,
 are you going to be able to do anything  about that blinding magic guy?
 You didn't stand a chance earlier,
 so it's probably better to wait for reinforcements.
 I thought of something.
 Huh?
 Unless I'm wrong...
 We've got a chance!
 We won't be able to surprise  attack him with my spatial magic.
 People with powerful magic have force  fields of magic that appear around them.
 I won't be able to get that close.
 Not to mention, I moved way too  many people really far today.
 I may only be able to use  my magic one more time.
 That's fine.
 Huh?
 Finral...
 Please!
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 This is the end.
 Dark Magic:
 Black Cocoon.
 This magic...
 I've gone into defensive mode, but...
 It's hopeless. He's gonna kill us.
 What?! How are you so calm?!
 Okay, then! I'll just deflect it!
 Nah. The swords will probably  be all that's left of you.
 No!
 Then what should we do?!
 Uh... Not give up until the end?
 Now you're just trying to act cool!
 To be completely honest, there's nothing we can do right now.
 Grit your teeth and stand firm. That's all we can do right now.
 Farewell, Yami Sukehiro.
 Whoa, what the hell?!  Did we come to the wrong place?
 Look!
 That's Yami's magic!
 Gah! This has gotten way out of hand!
 Light Magic: Ray of Divine Punishment.

 He's...
 Mirror Magic: Full Reflection!
 No matter how big or strong it is...
 Mirrors reflect light!
 To think someone could wound Sally this badly.
 I hate them. This is unforgivable.
 This is annoying, but it looks like it's our turn.

 M-Marie's coughing?!
 Did you catch a cold?
 It was pretty cold in the cave!  Are you all right, Marie?
 Yeah, my throat's just a little sore.
 Huh?
 My voice sounds strange.
 M-My angel Marie's voice  sounds like Captain Yami's!
 More importantly, Brother,  go save Asta and the others!
 Take my magic.
 The old hag's voice is weird, too?
 I may only be able to use  my magic one more time.
 You, too, Finral?!
 Wait, now my throat is...
 Your voice is cute!
 I did it, Marie! Your big  brother defeated the enemy!
 I need to hurry back to Marie...  Who the hell are you guys?
 No one said anything about reinforcements!

 I see. So I guess it's basically my glory.

 Don't make Marie wait!
 Honestly... You're so useless.
 You're too cruel!
 Looks like his own ultimate  spell did a number on him, too.
 Guess he had another archenemy  besides me. Don't worry 'bout it.
 I couldn't...
 risk hurting you...
 What are you talking about?
 What? You know him?  Sorry I beat the crap out of him.
 Of course I don't know this bastard.
 You'll understand eventually...
 Yeah, I don't get it at all,
 but we're going to take you back  to Magic Knights Headquarters.
 You'll spill everything there is to know about the Eye of the Midnight Sun there.
 Now that Hot-Blooded King of  Hardnoses has been avenged.
 May he rest in peace.
 But he's not dead yet!
 Oh, quit sweatin' the minor details.
 Minor?!
 Now, then. Let's see, Dark Binding Magic...
 Where was it again?
 Oh, there it is.
 Dark Restraints.
 Hey, when are those  reinforcements getting here?
 Where are the Magic Knights?
 Bah-ha! Black Bulls girl, I already  contacted your captain quite a while ago.
 Captain Yami?
 And what a bah-hassle it was. He wouldn't listen to a word I said.
 So where's Captain Yami?
 He should've left a while bah-hack. Bah-ha!
 What? Where'd he go?
 He hasn't come here!
 Bah-ha?
 Luca, Marco...
 Bah-ha... My shift's about over.
 Guess I'll head home and go to bed.
 I wonder if my captain's awake yet.  Guess I should report this to him.
 ""Why didn't you report this to me?  Do you want to get sliced in half? Skree!""
 Yeah, I definitely don't want that.
 Man, talk about scary.
 Mama!
 Thank goodness!
 I was so scared!
 Are you hurt? Do you feel okay?
 Uh-huh. I'm fine.
 There, there. You're safe now.
 The kids from the town!
 They're all safe.
 The Magic Knights came to save us!
 Thank you! We owe you everything!
 Y-Yes, we just fulfilled our  duty as Magic Knights.
 I mean, all I did was contact them, but...
 But why did he go straight over  there without stopping here first?
 I got left behind.
 Sister Theresa also used these  amazing spells and saved us!
 There was a really scary man.  He was covered in mud.
 Where are Luca and Marco? They're not here.
 Asta, Gauche... Say, what  happened to the Magic Knights?
 Asta?!
 Luca! Marco!
 Rebecca!
 Thank goodness. You're safe.
 I was so scared!
 There, there...
 Sister Theresa... A-Are you all right?
 Don't worry about me. I've still  got at least a hundred years to go.
 Thank you so much for saving these kids!
 It wasn't just me. Those brats...
 Sister, please don't talk any more.
 That robe...
 Asta lent it to me. He said I  wouldn't be scared if I wore it.
 And he was right! I felt so much braver. I didn't cry at all!
 Well done, Marco.
 Wait, where's Asta? What happened to Asta?
 He's still in the cave.
 Huh?
 Well... The battle's not over.
 Reinforcements showed up.
 Sister!
 Reinforcements?
 The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun. He called himself Licht.
 So Asta's fighting him?
 Along with some captain named Yami and...
 My brother went to help them, along  with someone who uses spatial magic.
 I'm sure everything will be okay! I believe in my brother!
 Yes, you're right. Everything will be okay.
 They won't lose. I'm sure  they'll come back victorious.
 Uh-huh!
 Finral and Gauche
 should've taken me with them if they  came all the way back to town.
 No, that's not it! It's not  that I'm worried about Asta!
 Magic Knights! It's because  I'm one of the Magic Knights!
 Oh, jeez. Anyway...
 Who are you?
 U-Um, well.. It's a long story.
 Hey, you ready yet?
 Please wait a little longer.
 I used a lot of magic. It's not  going to recover that quickly.
 Tch...
 You did it again!
 Tch, tch, tch, tch! Don't let it bother you.
 Of course it does!
 Stop making Marie wait.
 I didn't get any extra magic, unlike you!
 Hang on... The longer we wait, the happier she might be to see me.
 I guess I wouldn't mind that, either.
 Wouldn't mind what?
 I'm not telling you a single thing about Marie!
 Why?!
 Anyone who gets close to Marie is my enemy!
 Enemy?!
 Man, I'm starving.
 Can't you at least bring me some  breakfast with your spatial magic?
 I'm not a delivery service.
 Tch...
 What's the matter?
 This mana...
 Who the heck are those guys?
 Looks like reinforcements.
 Spatial magic?
 But that guy's passed out... So why?
 Well, this definitely doesn't look good.
 Looks like Licht and Val  are in a bit of trouble.
 I'm usually pretty lazy, but...
 I gotta save my friends.
 Hey, that's a unique design.
 Not that it really matters...
 Tch! He can move at light speed, too!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!
 Ow! Man, you're annoying.
 But this should be easy to fix, so whatever.
 Light Magic: Healing Light Particles.
 That magic... It's the  same as Round Eyebrows's!
 You came...
 I apologize. My strength alone wasn't enough.
 Licht, does it hurt?
 Fana, now that you're here...
 It's okay now.
 Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.
 I have nothing to worry about, now that you're here.
 Huh? Who do you think you are?
 Licht... It's a pain in the butt if you  try to shoulder everything yourself.
 How dare you insects do  that to my comrades?
 Unforgivable!
 I'll stomp you like ants and rip you apart,  like I'm ripping the wings off a butterfly!
 I hate those who have hurt Licht.
 Who are these guys?
 Allow me to introduce them.
 They are the strongest three  in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 The strongest?
 Yes... In combat, they surpass me.
 Third Eye
 The Third Eye!
 They're more powerful than you?
 Third Eye, eh?
 He has to be bluffing when he says  they're stronger than him.
 It's too much trouble to bluff.
 Just as the name suggests, your kingdom takes the clover as its symbol.
 Within the clover's leaves are  pleasant words that do not suit you.
 Namely: faith, hope, and love.
 I've given them names that  mean the opposite of those.
 With a name meaning the opposite of faith, Raia the Disloyal.
 Raia the Disloyal
 With a name meaning the opposite of hope, Vetto the Despair.
 Vetto the Despair
 And with a name meaning the opposite of love, Fana the Hateful.
 Fana the Hateful
 I will kill those who have  hurt Licht. I will kill you.
 ""Disloyal,"" ""Despair,"" and ""Hateful.""
 Those names sound grand and all,
 but your names aren't enough  to tell us how strong you are.
 Well, I guess we'll just  have to prove it to you,
 even though it's a pain in the butt.
 Wha—
 That's...
 The same as Captain Yami's!
 Copy Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash.
 Raia the Disloyal, was it?
 Don't go ripping off people's magic!
 I'm gonna sue you for copyright infringement!
 Yami!
 Pay attention!
 Beast Magic: Bear Claw!
 Damn it. My magic hasn't recovered yet.
 Stupid mosquitoes and dragonflies!
 He dodged!
 The jerk read my ki?!
 Beast Magic: Bear Claw!
 Now... Let me see the despair  in your faces, little mice.
 That makes you taste best!
 You bastard! This katana was  custom-made and crazy expensive!
 You better pay for that!
 Yami...
 Tch... I haven't even finished  paying this thing off.
 I hate you... I'll never forgive you.
 I'll kill you.
 Salamander... That must be spirit magic.
 Spirit magic?
 The same as... Yuno?
 Fana the Hateful, was it? Nobody likes  hysterical chicks, you know.
 Looks like it's not fully  developed yet, but...
 The fire spirit, one of  the four great attributes?
 You can't be serious.
 Now, then...
 Hope you're ready.
 I'll return Licht's pain  hundreds of times over.
 You guys stay put.
 C-Captain Yami?
 Here we go.
 Now... Burn them to death.
 Well, aren't you working hard? I wonder how long you can keep it up, though.
 It's futile!
 Captain!
 Not good. Because we're here, Yami is...
 But I haven't recovered enough  to use my spatial magic.
 They're on a completely different level!
 Captain Yami, I'll—
 I told you to stay put!
 What? Are you worried about me?
 You're thousands... No, a million  years too early for that!
 Just sit tight and watch!
 Watch me surpass my limits,  right here and now!
 As expected, you won't go down easily.
 But you're wasting your time.
 Each of them is stronger  than a Magic Knight Captain.
 I think it's about time we end this.
 Die.
 Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.
 Captain!
 What just...
 Looks like you're having fun, Yami.
 Let us play, too.
 Stronger than a Magic Knight Captain?
 Why don't we test out that theory?
 Aw, man... Another second or two,  and something would've awakened in me.
 What're you gonna do about this, you lousy so-called friends?
 I'm amazed you can even say those  words when you look like that.
 I'm going to execute you myself someday,  so be ready and wait, foreigner.
 Look who's talking. You and your stupid haircut.
 Honestly, how pathetic are you that  you actually have to rely on us?
 Man, harsh as always, I see.
 It can't be...
 Who are those guys?
 What?! They're Magic Knight Captains!
 Oh...
 You need to show more interest  if you're a Magic Knight!
 I only care about Marie.
 I'm surprised you even know my name, then.
 Captain of the Green Praying Mantises Jack the Ripper
 The captain of the Green Praying Mantises,  Jack the Ripper, who uses severing magic.
 He's super sadistic, has a destruction fetish,
 and likes to brag whenever he  cuts anything and everything.
 Apparently he cut down a mountain  after a squabble with Yami.
 Oh.
 Captain of the Silver Eagles Nozel Silva
 The warhorse, the royal captain  of the Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva.
 Just look at his sparkly aura.  Man, is he hot!
 Oh.
 Captain of the Blue Rose Knights Charlotte Roselei
 The captain of the Blue Rose Knights, the cool and beautiful Charlotte Roselei!
 You're excited all of a sudden?!
 She's so beautiful! I want  to get closer to her!
 So, three Magic Knight Captains...
 Hmph. It doesn't matter how many people... no, vermin show up. They're no match for us.
 I will kill those who  harm Licht... All of them.
 Now, then, let's get things started.  I'll chop you all up.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 We have plenty of questions for you.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 So Tired
 So Tired.
 So tired. Spring is nice and warm,  and I can sleep well.
 Sleeping on the beach  in summer is the best.
 Autumn is for food, autumn is for art...
 And winter is for hibernation.
 He's just sleeping all year round.
 I have trouble falling asleep, so I  hate everyone who can sleep so easily.
 Just wish these voices would shut up...
 Man, I'm tired.
 But I'm slightly awake now.
 Three Magic Knight Captains showed up, after all.

37,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Looks like his own ultimate  spell did a number on him, too.
 Asta and the others were  able to defeat the leader
 of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.
 But it was then that the strongest  three in the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 the Third Eye, showed up.
 Well, this definitely doesn't look good.
 How dare you insects do  that to my comrades?
 I hate those who have hurt Licht.
 Raia the Disloyal, Vetto the Despair, and Fana the Hateful.
 I have nothing to worry about, now that you're here.
 Faced with the trio's far superior strength,  the situation looked dire.
 I think it's about time we end this.
 Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.
 But then, the captain of the Green  Praying Mantises, Jack the Ripper;
 the captain of the Blue Rose  Knights, Charlotte Roselei;
 and the captain of the Silver  Eagles, Nozel Silva, arrived.
 Looks like you're having fun, Yami.
 The One With No Magic
 I'm so glad you're safe.
 And then Baro turned into mud.
 So in the end, you two were being used  by the Eye of the Midnight Sun, too?
 But it's true that my brother and I  kidnapped the children and stole their magic.
 So I plan to atone for both  my sins and my brother's.
 I'll turn myself in to the Magic Knights.
 Then Asta...
 He told me...
 Yeah. And when you're done  with that, let's be buddies.
 You can use really cool magic,  so you'd be really popular!
 Just like that.
 I'm very sorry.
 There's no point in apologizing to me.
 You're going to be his friend
 as soon as you atone for your crimes, right?
 Then you also need to pray  for Asta's safe return.
 Right.
 Asta, what are you doing?
 Hurry up and come back.
 Asta, please be safe.
 I-It's not like I care what  happens to Stupidsta.
 I don't care at all!
 Why does this keep happening lately?!
 Also, who am I making excuses to?!
 I see. So she also...
 I wonder if she's the one  Asta gave his heart to.
 There's no way he'd give me the time  of day with someone like her around.
 No, I shouldn't be thinking  about that right now.
 I have to do everything I can for  when Asta and the others come back.
 Okay!
 Reinforcements, eh?
 Hey, no fair, Yami. You were hogging these  fun-looking enemies all to yourself.
 Well? Are they worth slicing up?
 Nope, not at all.
 They're pretty much like paper.
 I was just about to finish them  off when you butted in, you jerk.
 Yeah, right. Look how beat up you are.
 Beat up? Who are you talking about?
 Actually, why don't I use this  opportunity to slice you up, too?
 Vent all of my past grudges.
 And there he goes. What an idiot.
 I'm sorry. Please spare me.
 You moron. Like I actually would.
 I'll only do it when you're in tip-top shape.
 Otherwise, there's no point.
 How long are you just going to sit there?
 You're so pathetic for a man.
 You idiot. The ground just loves me  so much, it won't let my ass go.
 You're the idiot.
 There's no way the ground  would love an outlaw like you.
 Talk about harsh. You're never going to find a guy who'll marry you with that attitude.
 Yikes.
 I don't need to marry anyone!
 The battlefield is my partner!
 The battlefield's your partner? That's sad.
 Why did I insult him again?
 More importantly, how did I  fall for someone like that?
 Even so, I just can't get him out of my head.
 I can't just come out and  say that I l-like him now.
 Besides, what would my  knights say about that?
 Are you serious, Sis?!
 He's a man! Seriously?!
 What am I thinking?  Now's not the time for this.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 Its leader and top brass...
 The top brass of the traitors who  attacked our country are all in a row.
 What a perfect opportunity.
 I'll bury them with my own hands.
 Wow, you're so cool.
 Begone from my sight, foreigner.
 Thanks for your consideration,  Mr. Ball o' Pride.
 Hey, I wonder how he gets his hair like that.
 Huh? Doesn't he just get one of his  servants to do it, since he's royalty?
 I'm sure he's got his own hair stylist.
 He actually has someone do  it for him? But it's so lame!
 Wait, so he does that braid himself?
 That's pretty gross, too.
 Shall I bury you lot first?
 Nah, don't waste your magic on a foreigner.
 I shall not hold back.
 I'm getting fired up!
 I can still fight, too!
 Stay out of this, pond scum.
 When the captains are on the battlefield,
 mediocre combatants will only slow us down.
 Especially a lowly peasant  with no magic like yourself.
 Very well! True despair lies at  the end of an endless battle!
 And the despair of the strongest  fighters is the ultimate spice!
 What the hell is he talking about?
 We're hunting some rats. Let's go.
 You seem pretty excited, Vetto. What a pain.
 Well, whatever.
 I guess I'll do my best for Licht.
 Right, so I call dibs on that pretty lady!
 If I win, we're going drinking together!
 If you win?
 In that case, we'll never  raise glasses together.
 Briar Creation Magic:  Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees!
 There!
 Whoa!
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe!
 You get to fight me, big guy!
 Oh? The Praying Mantis knight.
 You dare fight me, insect?
 Don't underestimate insects!
 You're just a praying mantis!
 I'll tear off your limbs and  wings while you're still alive!
 Bear Claw!
 The one I have business with is you.
 Mercury Magic: Silver Spears!
 You want to hurt Licht, too?
 I hate you. Die.
 Her flames melted your mercury!
 Want me to switch with you, Sparkles?
 Shut your mouth.
 As if flames like those could hurt me.
 Just who do you think I  spent years competing with?!
 What?!
 What is this?
 They're practically a natural disaster!
 I can't see through all this dust!
 Wow, they're working hard.
 Hey, that's cutting it a little close, Jack.
 Not bad, Charlotte.
 I'm surprised Nozel's braid stays in place.
 You can see them?
 I'm using ki. Try it,  even if you can't see them.
 Hey, Finral.
 Yes, sir?
 You've recovered enough spatial magic for one trip, haven't you?
 We're going home? Yes, let's!
 Let's let them handle this and—
 True, Magic Knights captains are strong.
 But they cannot defeat the Third Eye...
 Because we are loved by mana.
 So...
 This must be some kind of mistake.
 For that mere human with no magical  powers, who isn't loved by mana,
 to have that grimoire...
 I must hurry and retrieve it.
 I finally weakened him this much.  There's no way I'm letting him go!
 I figured you'd try that!
 He's countering? Not good!
 Yami!
 Oh, dear. Looks like you  underestimated our boss too much.
 Farewell.
 Licht...
 You're after the leader's head, too, right?
 Go on. Go!
 Wha—
 What's he doing there?!
 How did he get through the  smoke from this melee?
 If you can read ki, it ain't impossible.
 We didn't notice. None of us did.
 We couldn't sense him.
 Because he has... no magic!
 Not giving up...
 Thanks for believing I'd take a shot at you.
 I believed in our no-magic idiot!
 ...is my magic!
 How'd you like that? No magic in that attack!
 Same with my attack.
 Captain!
 You surpassed your limits, kid.
 Right!
 Licht!
 Licht!
 You've got some nerve, looking away!
 That shrimp got us.
 He totally stole the glory!
 We cannot fall behind.
 Let's finish off the rest of them!
 Yami!
 There won't be any other  reinforcements, will there?
 Badump, badump.
 What? No way!
 Let's finish him off while  the others are being held up!
 Yeah.
 What...
 What is that?
 Crap!
 Because of that brat's anti-magic attack,
 the sealing magic on Licht has been broken!
 Crap.
 That power's being held back  for the day that's to come...
 Why?
 Why do you have that grimoire?
 Why do you...
 have the Demon-Slayer Sword  and the Demon-Dweller Sword?
 What's he talking about?
 Those swords belong to the master!
 ""The master""?
 According to our intel,
 ""the master"" should refer to the leader  of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Does this mean it's not him?
 All this about getting something back, or something belonging to the master...
 What the heck are you even talking about?
 This crappy grimoire and these  crappy swords belong to me!
 Stop making false accusations,  you crazy bastard!
 No... Give them back.
 That grimoire is...
 Our master's grimoire and swords...
 What?!
 Captain!
 A human like you shouldn't have them.
 Well, this isn't good.
 Bring it on!
 Death Scythe!
 Why? I need to get them back.
 It swallowed up my severing magic!
 Such an incredible concentration of magic!
 If he actually releases that...
 He'll blow this whole area away!
 Even we won't be able to stop that!
 What is this magic?
 We're finished. His power was  actually restricted before?
 I knew I shouldn't have come!
 Actually, I wish I'd never  even joined this squad!
 Hey, quit your complaining.
 This is actually our chance.
 If we defeat him and this power,  we'll leave our limits in the dust!
 All right!
 No way! You guys are nuts!
 Hey! Don't you dare give up, Finral!
 I have seniority here!
 I'm not completely recovered yet.
 Can I reflect it with my remaining magic?
 Sorry, pretty lady.
 We'll have to finish this next time.
 If this keeps up, you won't last, Licht!
 Trinity Sealing Magic!
 They're actually trying to seal that?
 That magic...
 Damn...
 You worked a little too hard there, Licht.
 Get some rest.
 He's okay.
 Damn it.
 Let's go, Vallie.
 Our boss isn't feeling too good,  so we're gonna head home for today.
 We lost this time. But the next time we  meet, I'll show you what true despair is!
 Rodents will fall prey to the carnivores.
 And that will be the end of you.
 We, the Eye of the Midnight Sun, are always watching you.
 Such an unbelievable amount of magic...  and they were easily able to seal it.
 They weren't giving their all.
 Not only do they all possess  a great amount of mana,
 but their control of natural  mana was on another level.
 Looks like they're loved by mana.
 They're definitely worth slicing up.
 They got away.
 But I will be the one to avenge you.
 No matter what!
 D-Did we win?
 I'm not sure if we actually won or  if it's more like they ran away.
 Pretty sure we can say  we won if they ran away.
 They did say they lost.
 A-All right!
 We did it, Finral! Gauche!
 Yeah! We did it!
 You didn't do a thing.
 Hey!
 All right! We did it! We did it!
 So, Yami... Don't you have something to say?
 Man, I'm starving.
 Not that. How about thanking us, huh?
 What would've happened if we hadn't shown up?
 I wouldn't have let them escape like you  did, and I would've defeated them all.
 And I told you, that's not possible.
 What a pathetic man you are.
 I can't believe that lot  gave you so much trouble.
 Jeez. Harsh as usual.
 Amazing... I can't believe he was  actually fighting those three alone.
 I guess it's no wonder  that I f-fell for him.
 If you don't learn to be a little nicer,  you're going to be single forever.
 I told you, I don't care!
 My partner is the battlefield!
 You should just worry about your partner!
 If we're both still single when we're old, wanna take care of each other?
 Wha—You can't be serious!  I wouldn't be caught dead with you!
 Why can't I ever just be honest?!
 Asta!
 Yeah, I'm not surprised he hit his limit.
 Oh, well. Go get him fixed up, Finral.
 Me?!
 You need to be of some use.
 I'm pretty sure I've been  useful this whole time!
 Tch.
 Really?!
 The Black Bulls... Asta, eh?
 Licht pushed himself a  little too far this time.
 Well, he can rest now.
 Licht...
 What the hell? You're shaming  the name of the Third Eye.
 What did you say?
 Er... So what do we do now?
 Now that Licht's identity is known,
 the Wizard King's bound to put  everything into this investigation.
 Geork and Catherine are still  being held captive, too.
 If they get anything out  of them, this place...
 and Licht's true identity will...
 Well, Rades is right.
 It's a bit early.
 It wouldn't be good if they  found things out this early.
 Hmm... What to do?
 Oh, well. I'd rather not go,  but I don't think I have a choice.

 Sis Is Being Weird
 Sis Is Being Weird.
 Honestly, why have I fallen  for that overbearing,
 crude man who doesn't even  look like he's twenty-eight?!
 I want to embrace him... with my briars.
 Yami!
 What was that about Captain Yami, Sis?
 N-Nothing at all!
 Don't call me ""Captain""! Call me ""Sis""!
 Wait, that's backwards.
 I thought I heard something about briars.
 Briars? Yes, briars!
 I was thinking about how I wanted  to bind that Yami tightly with my briars!
 Oh, I see! You want to torment him, right?
 Man, you must really hate Captain Yami, Sis!
 Y-Yes! I absolutely despise that man!
 Well, he is a man! Who'd want to even see his face?
 Yes... I don't want to see his face.
 I want to beat him with my briar whip!
 Why can't I be more honest?!
 I hate you. How could you hurt Licht?
 I will not forgive you, Magic Knights.

 It's so pretty.
 Where am I?
 It can't be... Is this heaven?!

 I'm so sorry!
 Asta...
 What are you talking about?
 There's not a chance you'd actually die.
 Yuno! Noelle and Mimosa...
 And Mr. Glasses!
 I was worried about you.
 Thank goodness! I don't know what  I'd do if you hadn't woken up!
 How long are you going to  hold on to each other?!
 I'm injured here!
 Hmph!
 The Magic Knights Captain Conference
 What?! I was asleep for a whole day?!
 Yes. You were even snoring.
 Must've been a nice nap.
 That just means he was able to use  all of his strength to fight.
 We wanted to fight with you, but by the time we got there,
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun had escaped.
 You guys contacted us too late.
 That's why we were caring for you after  you were brought to the church, Asta.
 Thanks for the recovery magic, Mimosa.
 Oh, it's nothing at all, really.
 The one who worked the hardest to  make sure you were okay is Klaus.
 A-Ahem...
 More importantly,  thanks to you and the others,
 it appears that all of the  kidnapped children are safe.
 Also, regarding the perpetrator Neige,
 they're interrogating him  back at headquarters.
 I'm assuming he knows nothing  about the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 They're taking into consideration
 his deep regret and the fact  that he meant no harm.
 I think he's going to be  doing volunteer work
 here at this church to pay for his crimes.
 I see. That's perfect for him!
 Anyway, it sounds like you  did a great job again—
 If I were there, I wouldn't have let  the Eye of the Midnight Sun escape.
 I'll get them for sure next time!
 Yuno! I'm never going to lose to you!
 I'm still going to keep getting  stronger and stronger!
 And I'll continue to get  even stronger than you.
 Then I'm going to keep trying  more, more, and even more!
 And then one day...
 ...I'll become the Wizard King!
 Oh, you two get along so well!
 Huh?
 Not a chance.
 We should probably take our leave.
 Yes.
 Oh, yes!
 Sister Theresa also just  woke up not too long ago.
 Huh?
 Gauche should be with her right now.
 Hey, I came to see you, old hag who doesn't know when to die.
 Is that how you talk to an injured person?
 Get the hell out, you sister complex punk.
 What? Should I just finish you off,  since you don't know when to die?
 Go ahead and try. Then you'll  go right back to the slammer,
 you sister complex punk  with a criminal record.
 Don't fight with her, Brother!
 Well, if that's what you want, Marie.
 And... I guess I'm at least grateful that  you took care of Marie, you stupid old hag.
 Hmph. I guess you've grown, if you can actually thank people.
 Also...
 I'm glad you're alive.
 I see.
 Now, my beloved angel Marie,  praise your big brother for not arguing!
 Pardon me!
 It's Asta!
 Yay!
 I was worried about you!
 I won't die!
 I'm going to kill you after all.
 He's still got a long way to go.
 How are you feeling, Granny?
 Who do you think I am?
 More importantly,  when I tell your Sister Lily
 about all of your heroic deeds  this time, I'm sure she'll be pleased.
 True!
 Sister Lily! Soon I'll become the  Wizard King and come for you!
 Asta, we have to head back soon.
 Wait, there's one place  we have to visit first.
 It's so good!
 This is so frickin' good!
 R-Really? I was cooking so you'd have  plenty to eat when you woke up,
 but I guess I made a little too much.
 What is this? This is really good.
 So good!
 I'll kill him. I'll kill him.
 Oh, come on, Brother!
 I'm not done eating yet!
 I'll kill him... I'll kill him... I'll kill him...
 I wonder if guys prefer girls  who can cook, after all.
 Asta! Thanks for lending me your robe!
 Sure. Looks like you kept it clean,  just like you promised.
 Yup!
 Your robe may be fine, but look how beaten up you got!
 It looks like you're hopeless without me.
 I'm pretty sure I get beat up  even when you're around, Noelle.
 Someone he can fight alongside, huh?
 Oh, shut up, Stupidsta!
 I know I can't use recovery  magic like Mimosa!
 True.
 Asta...
 Sorry, but I'm getting the first kiss.
 Thank you for saving Luca and Marco, Asta!
 Huh? Huh?
 Y-Yeah! You're welcome!
 H-H-Hey... Wh-Wh-What?!
 Shrimpsta! Did you burn off your lunch?!
 Yes, sir!
 All right! We're gonna have a traditional  Black Bulls eating contest
 to commemorate your full recovery!
 This time, we're having tato pies!
 Thanks!
 I'm starving!
 Have we done something like this before?
 Nope!
 More importantly, you should fight me!
 I wish I could've fought the Third Eye!
 Marie, we've already been apart half a day...
 I want to give Asta a surprise party, too.
 Yeah, I'm going to pass.
 If I ate this much, I'd just get  a stomachache and end up in bed.
 I'm also going to pass. What are you  trying to make a royal like me do?
 Shut yer traps!
 All of you are participating,  whether you like it or not.
 All right, Mr. Yami! Please do  us the honor of being the judge!
 All right, if you're all  done complaining now...
 Ready... go!
 So good!
 It's instantly dehydrating me...
 Hey, I haven't even eaten,  but I'm already full!
 Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
 Finral, you bastard.
 Stop using your spatial magic to  dump all this into Luck's stomach.
 You caught me.
 Aw, but I can't eat these if I don't  have some pretty lady feeding me.
 You're out.
 Flame Magic: Explosive Reheating!
 I thought they'd taste better if I baked  them a little more, but I overcooked them.
 You're out.
 I've still got plenty of room for seconds!
 Hi.
 Gordon?! What are you doing there?!
 You can keep eating. Here, say, ""Ah.""
 You're being creepy, so you're out.
 I'd rather devour Marie than  do something this stupid.
 You're both out since you  haven't eaten a damn thing!
 Hydration... Hydration...
 They were both done a long time ago.
 The only ones left are...
 Asta and Charmy are head-to-head!
 All right! I'll show you I can  win this without using magic!
 Results
 As for the results,
 Charmy won without using magic.
 Victor: Charmy Pappitson
 You've still got a lot to learn, kid.
 My identity!
 No one's surprised.
 That crest...
 That's a letter from the  royal capital, isn't it?
 Is there an incident?  Do we need to take action?!
 Shut up and rest.
 Or so I'd like to say... but it looks  like the Wizard King wants to see you.
 The Wizard King?!
 The other captains and I have a conference  tomorrow, so he says to bring you along.
 I wonder what he wants!
 Like I know.
 You'll find out when you get there.
 Wizard King,
 I have sent a message to all of
 the Magic Knights Captains  regarding tomorrow's conference.
 Thanks, Marx.
 I don't want to believe it,
 but it's clear that there's  a traitor among us
 who's connected to the  Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 And I'll find out who it is tomorrow.
 But...
 Are you sure this is going to work?
 It'll all depend on Asta.
 We've been waiting for you,
 Captain of the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro, and
 Asta.
 Um... Who are you again?
 I guess this is the first time we've  really spoken to one another.
 I'm...
 Mushroom Head.
 Yes, Mushroom Head.
 Hey! Please don't be so rude!
 Wizard King's Advisor Marx Francois
 My name is Marx. I'm the Wizard King's advisor.
 The Wizard King's?! You're awesome, Mushroom Head!
 Well, it's definitely a lot of work.
 Also, my name's Marx, not Mushroom Head.
 So, where's the conference  being held, Mushroom Head?
 It's M-a-r-x!
 It'll take a bit more time to finish  preparing for the conference,
 so please wait with the other captains.
 Would you come with me, Asta?
 I heard you fought splendidly  the other day, Asta.
 I'm sure you'll receive at least another  ten stars from the Wizard King.
 Seriously?! All right!
 Wait... Where are we?
 We're headed to an underground prison that  very few in the royal capital know of.
 We keep important prisoners down here.
 Important prisoners?
 You know that we've captured members of the
 Eye of the Midnight Sun who were involved  in the attack against the capital, right?
 Then the ones in the underground prison...
 Yes. They have a spell on them  that protects their memories,
 so we haven't been able to get any info about the Eye of the Midnight Sun yet.
 But the Wizard King thought  that your anti-magic sword
 could possibly undo the protection.
 When they attacked the capital, they were always one step ahead of us.
 That would've been impossible unless  they had help from the inside.
 We're pretty certain there's  a traitor among us,
 and it's someone rather high up.
 On the level of a Magic Knights Captain.
 N-No way!
 We'd rather not believe that, either.  That's why we want to clear things up.
 We're here.
 Right...
 Hello?
 Hey, Asta. Great work again.
 Th-The Wizard King! It's great to see you!
 Sorry to bring you here  when you're probably tired,
 but you're the only one who  can use the anti-magic sword.
 By the way, I heard you fought with the  higher-ups of the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 What kinds of magic did they use?
 Wh-What kinds?
 Say what?! Copy magic?
 They can copy other people's magic?
 That's amazing!
 Beast magic?! I've never  heard of that before!
 What?! Spirit magic?!
 Fire? So, the Salamander?!
 I would've loved to see all of that!
 Um...
 Wizard King!
 Oh, sorry about that.
 All right, Asta. Could you give it a try?
 Do you think you can do it?
 I believe so! As you wish, Wizard King!
 What's the deal with that brat?
 This isn't good.
 That's the brat who uses anti-magic.
 He's planning on breaking the protection  spell that's on our memories.
 Don't... Don't touch me, you stupid brat!
 Hi-yah!
 Now, Marx.
 Yes, sir.
 Memory Exchange Magic: Mémoire Absolue!
 Wh-What is this?
 I've made a connection  directly into their heads,
 and this spell allows me to get answers  from their true memories.
 Now they won't be able  to hide anything anymore.
 That's so cool...
 I know, right?! It's such an awesome spell!
 Isn't it cool?!
 Yeah!
 Silence! I need quiet, please!
 Yes, sir...
 I will ask you both a number of questions.
 Answer me honestly.
 Understood?
 Yes.
 Captain of the Purple Orcas Gueldre Poizot
 I heard about your work at Nean.
 To think that four Magic Knights Captains  would actually let the terrorists escape.
 Captain of the Green Praying Mantises Jack the Ripper
 They're nothing like the weaklings  you guys were dealing with
 from the Diamond Kingdom  and the Spade Kingdom!
 Says the captain of a squad  with fewer stars than mine.
 You sure you're not doing anything  underhanded to get those stars?
 Captain of the Black Bulls Yami Sukehiro
 Man, the gleam on a new  katana is something else.
 Sucks that I'll be making payments  on it for ten years, though.
 Anyway, calm down, Original  Scrawny Line-Face Guy.
 What Garbledre is saying is the truth.
 It's Gueldre.
 You're the last person I want  to hear that from, No-Stars Yami.
 Captain of the Coral Peacocks Dorothy Unsworth
 Whatever. I've got plenty of black stars.
 Those are negative stars!  Why are you proud of that?
 Captain of the Silver Eagles Nozel Silva
 Silence, you foreigner and former peasant.
 You're annoying.
 What was that, Mister Royalty?  Do you want to join in?
 Captain of the Blue Rose Knights Charlotte Roselei
 How stupid. We're getting nowhere  because of you noisy men.
 Why am I next to Yami?!
 Calm down, Charlotte. Stay calm... Calm...
 Captain of the Aqua Deer Rill Boismortier
 I guess they haven't decided on a temporary  captain for the Crimson Lion Kings yet.
 If Fuegoleon was here, he'd pull  things together really well, but...
 Did the air just get really heavy?!
 I'm the youngest, so I  need to lighten the mood!
 Look!
 This is my Fuegoleon impression!
 What do you think you're doing?
 Don't let the fact that you're the  youngest captain ever go to your head.
 Huh?!
 You're a funny guy!
 Sorry to keep you all waiting.
 Captain of the Golden Dawn William Vangeance
 I apologize for being late.
 What were you doing, Vangeance?
 Oh, there was some business  I couldn't get out of.
 I expect you're busy.
 You are the charismatic captain of the squad  with the most stars this term, after all.
 I'd love to know your secret.
 How did you claw your way up to become  the strongest squad so very fast?
 I hear those who join your squad will  develop powers beyond all expectations.
 Do you have magic that  can see people's futures?
 I have no power that impressive.
 My knights work hard, that's all.
 Really, I'd like to ask you, a wealthy merchant,  the trick to making so much money.
 That's a company secret.
 I've been thinking this for a while,  but the way you laugh is creepy.
 Why would you bring that up now?
 Also, you resemble a boneless ham.
 Vangeance...
 Where were you during the  distinguished service ceremony?
 It's customary for a captain  to accompany members
 of his squad when they attend the ceremony.
 Business you couldn't get out of again?
 I was out gambling. I lost all my money.
 Sorry.
 No one asked you.
 The air got heavy again!
 This time, I'll do it right!
 And you, if you're attempting to do an  impression of me, you'd better be prepared.
 You're right!
 It's not easy to do that braid over your face!
 Man, you're hilarious.
 Come on, don't pick on Goldy.
 I mean, you don't use light magic, do you?
 Indeed.
 And there it goes again!
 Look, everyone!
 This is my Yami impression!
 Keep your mouth shut, Fluffy!
 Huh?!
 You must've been really  spoiled growing up, rich kid.
 Well, don't expect the same  treatment from me, loser.
 He was laughing before, but suddenly snapped?!
 And you! Quit sleeping!
 Oh, can you talk in snores?
 I have no idea what you're saying, though!
 Not to mention, Julius was the one who  called us all here, so where is he?!
 That old guy better not have forgotten  us and wandered off somewhere!
 That's very possible.
 I apologize for keeping you waiting.
 Everything is ready,
 so if you'd hold the conference in another room—
 Huh?!
 You come here!
 Huh?! He's snapped?!
 Hey, kid. Working hard?
 Y-Yes, sir. Great work, sir.
 Does he need to take a dump or something?
 What did you need, Wizard King?
 Those two are from the  Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 Did you learn something from them?
 Yes. Several things, thanks to Marx and Asta.
 I suppose this is the biggest one.
 I've learned that there  is a traitor among you
 who is working with the  Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Memory Exchange Magic!!
 Memory Exchange Magic.
 Mémoire Absolue!
 I will ask you a series of questions.  Answer me honestly.
 Okay.
 If you were asked to choose  between being the Wizard King
 and your obsession with magic...
 Obsession with magic.
 I knew it!
 I-In that case...
 What do you think about me?
 You can be a bit naggy, but you're  a hard worker. I'm always grateful.
 I see...
 Because of that, I can concentrate  more on my obsession with magic,
 rather than being the Wizard King.
 What?!
 There's a traitor in this dungeon?
 The Magic Knights are
 supposed to be people everyone  in the Clover Kingdom can look up to!
 I'm gonna teach you a lesson!
 Black Clover, Page 39: ""Three-Leaf Salute.""

 I won't forgive the traitor!

39,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun  is led by a man named Licht,
 who owns a four-leaf grimoire.
 They are a terrorist group he formed  six years ago, and they hold
 a grudge against the Clover Kingdom.
 They have about fifty mages who are members.
 Among them are their leader, Licht,
 as well as the three they call the  Third Eye: Raia, Vetto, and Fana.
 They are much stronger  than the other members.
 They all hold a strong grudge  against the Clover Kingdom,
 and they use that to justify  their terrorist attacks.
 Their endgame is to have an  independent country of their own.
 That about covers everything, doesn't it?
 Yes.
 And this is the most important  bit of information...
 I've learned that there  is a traitor among you
 who is working with the  Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 What?! Among the c-c-captains?!
 I knew it.
 Who could it be?
 Because of you, Captain Fuegoleon was...
 Why?! Why would you betray us?!
 Three-Leaf Salute
 Now, would you kindly tell me
 which one of these captains is the traitor  who aided the Eye of the Midnight Sun?
 Tell me their name.
 It's...
 The captain of the Purple Orcas,
 Gueldre Poizot.
 Impossible! What are you talking about?
 Th-They're terrorists that  attacked our beloved nation!
 You'd actually believe what they're saying?
 As if I would ever betray the Clover Kingdom!
 I'd rather not say this,
 but I've heard a few dark rumors about you.
 It's not just a few. We've heard many.
 Wh-What? Really?
 Come to think of it, I've heard  plenty of rumors like that.
 Apparently, they weren't all false.
 I knew you were probably up to  something sketchy, but this is just...
 Don't be ridiculous! Th-This  must be some kind of mistake!
 I know! They're trying  to frame me as a traitor!
 They're only telling me what  they know, plain and simple.
 Information obtained with  my memory exchange magic
 is absolute.
 You heard him, Hard Ham.
 I'm not hard!
 Just calm down.
 Why not just let the guy with the  bowl cut look at your memories?
 If you're really a clean ham, that is.
 I agree with everything other  than what you called me.
 If you're truly innocent, you should.
 W-Well, I...
 What? Are you embarrassed?
 You a teenage boy or something?
 You're behaving shamefully, Gueldre.
 You will pay for betraying  the kingdom with your death.
 So it really is you.
 Because of you, Captain Fuegoleon was...
 No! This is some sort of trap!
 I'll clear my name!  This is a strategic retreat!
 Transparency Creation Magic:  Invisible Great Mage!
 He disappeared?
 He's actually trying to get away?
 Well, this just got real.
 This isn't good. His transparency magic
 makes him vanish for a set amount of time,  and all spells will go right through him.
 Meaning while he's invisible,  our attacks won't do a thing.
 What?! But that makes him invincible!
 Transparency Creation Magic: Invisible Troops.
 Hold them back for me!
 We can't just let him get away!
 Dorothy, this is no time to be sleeping!
 What are we going to do? We can't  catch him if we can't see him.
 Yami.
 There's nothing to worry about.
 I'm not going to get caught  by the likes of you!
 My magic is invincible!
 I used this power to claw my way up to  the position of Magic Knights Captain!
 Then I accumulated a fortune through  business and became a wealthy merchant.
 I am a great mage who has  both wealth and power!
 I won't let it end here!
 I will rise again and again with this  magic and my business talent!
 You're right there!
 Wh-What?!
 Y-You shouldn't have been able to see me!
 How?! How were you able to attack me?!
 Hard Ham is able to hide his  magical powers, but not his ki.
 And since the anti-magic sword  isn't magical, it'll work against him.
 Looks like an anti-magic kid who can read  ki ended up being his natural enemy.
 Don't mock me! I'm a captain!
 You magicless peasant!
 You look better when you're  groveling on the ground!
 Not yet!
 I'm not letting you get away!
 The Magic Knights Captains  that I admire so much
 wouldn't run away over something like this!
 Very well. If you want to die that badly...
 I shall grant your wish for you!
 Mr. Poizot.
 Hold still a sec.
 Picture Magic: Spring of Restriction.
 Ah, yes, Mr. Poizot, you're a picture-perfect fellow.
 I think I'll call this...
 The Drowning Captain.
 What do you think?
 What is this magic?
 Rill, how dare you go easy on him?
 Well, I mean, if I hadn't done that,
 this building would've been destroyed.
 His magic allows all magic  to pass through him.
 In that case, we can simply  attack using physical objects.
 We'll just have some commoners  rebuild the building.
 I lost the chance to let loose on a captain.
 The guy resembles a ham exactly,  so he would've been perfect to slice up.
 We're Magic Knight Captains.  We can't just sit around and space out.
 We have to at least strike a pose.
 Are you still asleep?!
 Actually, you still managed to keep up...
 You sure are reliable for  someone who's always asleep!
 Running away, even though  you're a man. How pathetic.
 Even if you weren't a traitor,  you'd still be a failure as a captain.
 Wh-Why is Yami only paying  attention to Dorothy?
 Does he like women like her?
 Friends, I believe that's enough.
 Someone may be controlling him with magic.
 Wow, I'm glad I said that  when everyone was here.
 I can't tone down my magic, after all.
 These people are insane!
 These are the best Magic Knights...  the best in the country?!
 Hey! You were amazing earlier!
 How did you know where Mr. Poizot was?
 How'd you undo his transparency magic?!
 U-Um...
 Well, whatever. I'm Rill, and I'm nineteen! Who are you?
 I-I'm Asta, and I'm fifteen.  Wait, you're nineteen and a captain?!
 Ah, so you're younger than me! Hey, Asta, be my friend!
 Wait, with a captain? Uh...
 Well, sure! Okay!
 Yay! Just between you and me,
 everyone here's way older than me, so it's  been rough having to tiptoe around them!
 I see! And they're all weirdos, too!
 Hey, you jerks. I can hear you.
 Also, you're the weirdos here.
 Now, then...
 I have some questions for you,
 Gueldre.
 Gueldre, everything you've  said so far is true?
 Yes.
 Man, that's quite the list.
 Abusing his own squad members,
 embezzling funds, selling national  treasure-class magic items
 on the black market...
 And smuggling dangerous magic  potions from other countries.
 He's already pitch-black  before even being a traitor.
 He might be a good fit for the Black Bulls.
 Actually, becoming a burnt-black  ham sounds better for him.
 What are you even going on about?
 So this is why he didn't want  his memory read with magic.
 Most important of all...  Kidnapping barrier mages.
 That's direct cooperation with  the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 That's solid proof of how they managed  to infiltrate the royal capital.
 He was dazzled by rare magic items and  made a deal with those terrorists.
 What a fool.
 Well, unfortunately, he's always been like that.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun has probably  killed the kidnapped barrier mages already.
 This is an unparalleled blunder.
 He was a Magic Knight, charged with protecting our citizens,
 yet he sold them out instead.
 In order to keep the citizens  from growing uneasy,
 we won't make this a public matter.
 But to ensure that this never happens again,
 check all of your squad members to make  sure no one has ties to the enemy.
 Yes, sir!
 Well, well...
 I'm a pretty decent actor.
 No one can see through my  copy transformation magic.
 So which one of them was actually me?
 Now nobody's going to be  suspicious for a while.
 I'm sorry for making you two stay behind.
 It's sad... being betrayed by  comrades who fought alongside me.
 I sprinted at full speed to get where I am,
 but as a result, I may have  made a lot of mistakes.
 If that's the reason you had us stay behind,
 you picked the wrong guys, Julius.
 To tell you the truth,  when we were interrogating
 the two Eye of the Midnight Sun members,
 they told us one more thing.
 Asta, do you remember the stone  tablet back at their hideout
 when you were taken by them?
 That thing...
 They call the stones that were  set into it ""magic stones.""
 They believe that if they  collect all of them,
 they will be reborn into their true forms,
 which are linked closely to mana,  and gain enormous power.
 Apparently they also went after Fuegoleon
 because they wanted the  magic stone that he had.
 Reborn, eh?
 You sure they didn't just read  one too many fantasy novels?
 We don't know whether that's true or not, but their obsession with it is real.
 We must not let them get the stones.
 Oh, and?
 There are three magic stones left.
 They know the location of one of them.
 Yeah? And where's that?
 In a strong magic region...
 The Underwater Temple.
 A... strong magic region?
 What's that?
 I'm pretty sure you don't  need this head anymore.
 Stop! I won't say any more! Please spare me!
 Perfect. Let me crush it for you.
 Strong magic regions are, as the name  suggests, regions with strong magic,
 where all sorts of magical phenomena  occur to prevent people from entering.
 Of all the regions with strong magic, the Underwater Temple
 is said to be especially dangerous.
 The dungeon you recently  conquered could be considered
 a beginner's course in comparison.
 There's a place that's even  more amazing than that?
 So you want us to get there before  the Eye of the Midnight Sun does
 and snatch the magic stone or whatever?
 That's right.
 This is an important mission.  The best squad for the job
 is the one with lots of members who aren't  restricted by familial or social status...
 Which means your Black Bulls, Yami.
 There may still be traitors  among the Magic Knights.
 Will you do it?
 You're the Wizard King. If that's  what you think, just give the order.
 As a captain, you're definitely right that  I don't have anything holding me back.
 I hear he's not from this kingdom.
 Apparently he's a castaway from some foreign  country who lives on the coast by himself.
 He looks kinda dangerous.
 I wish he'd just leave the country.
 You can't be serious! Why does a  foreigner like him get a grimoire?
 I bet his magic's worthless.
 Let's get rid of him with our magic later.
 What's that magic?
 Scary...
 How creepy.
 Yeah... Just because I got a grimoire, that doesn't change the fact that I'm a foreigner.
 I don't have anything tying me down, but that also means I'll always be alone.
 Or so I thought...
 Wow! That's dark magic, isn't it?!
 That's amazing! I've never seen that before!
 Hey, hey, hey! Let me  get a better look at it!
 No. Who the heck are you, old man?
 Old...? Oh, but I'm not suspicious at all!
 I'm just a Magic Knights Captain who  was wandering around in disguise.
 What's a Magic Knight?
 Huh? You don't know?!
 Hmm...
 Well, why not come see for yourself?
 I'm sure you've got potential.
 Nope.
 Oh, come on! Don't be like that!
 Nope.
 I'll treat you to dinner.
 Okay, I'll go.
 I see. I guess that's not enough...
 Wait. You'll come?
 I'll go if you buy me dinner. I'll definitely go.
 You sure are interesting!
 I guess I've been stuck with you ever since.
 I'm just going to use my power  to prove it, that's all.
 To prove that you've made no mistakes.
 Yami's actually saluting.
 I'm counting on you, Yami.
 And you, Asta...
 Y-Yes, sir!
 It's a strange coincidence  that you joined Yami's squad.
 Strong magic regions have  strong mana force fields
 around them that prevent  outsiders from getting in.
 I doubt anyone would be able to  get in without your anti-magic.
 And your experience fighting  with the Eye of the Midnight Sun
 is bound to be very useful.
 I'm counting on you.
 Yes, sir!
 I got too excited and  knocked the air out of myself!
 I've never seen someone  self-destruct from saluting.
 I can definitely tell that you chose him, considering how interesting he is.
 You were stiff as a board back there.
 I guess clowns can get nervous, too.
 Who are you calling a clown, sir?
 It's just... I've never had someone who I  thought was amazing, like the Wizard King,
 expect anything from me before.
 Joining the Magic Knights when  you can't even use magic?
 There's no way!
 Actually, no one's ever really expected  anything from me to begin with.
 Ouch!
 I let you join the Black Bulls  because I thought you could do it.
 Work your butt off.
 Yes, sir!
 All right!
 The beach!
 Men bring to mind the beach!  The beach brings to mind men!
 I'm getting all excited for no good reason!
 Yeah! Come to think of it, I've  never even seen the ocean before!
 I haven't either, Shrimpsta!
 Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach!
 There's nothing better than enjoying  a cold one under the blazing sun!
 Shake, shake, let's shake!
 I'll make some original drinks and flirt  with some hotties in swimsuits on the beach!
 S-Swimsuits?!
 Does that mean...
 If I go to the beach, I-I-I-I'll  have to wear a swimsuit, too?!
 Mr. Shrimp, Mr. Crab, and all the  many other varieties of seafood,
 I can't wait to grill you  all up on the beach...
 I hope we all get to put sunscreen  on each other at the beach.
 Captain!
 Captain, what should I get for Marie?
 Hey, sharks are strong, right?
 I hope the sharks eat you both.
 S-Swimsuit... Swimsuit...
 If you don't have one, you can borrow one of mine.
 Beach! Beach! Bea—
 Shut up!
 We're not going for leisure!  We're going for work!
 Yes, sir...
 The Underwater Temple, huh?
 I wonder what it's like...
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Game Tournament
 Game Tournament.
 This is so cool!
 To think your magic can let us play games  like this... You're amazing, Mr. Bowlcut!
 This is called memory amusement magic,
 and it allows you to battle with characters
 you've created from your memory.
 And my name is Marx—
 Whoa! The captain was super  strong when he was young!
 How nostalgic. It's Yami  when I first met him.
 You're no match for me, kid.
 Not yet! I'm not done yet!
 Go right! Right! Counterattack!
 Now left!
 You bastard...
 Why don't we have a real battle  instead of one in a game?
 I'll die!
 It'll seriously be game over!
 Wh-What should I do? If we're going  to the beach, I'll need a swimsuit.
 I need to buy a new one!
 I wonder what kind Asta likes...

40,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun considers  the Clover Kingdom their enemy.
 Their goal is to defeat the Clover Kingdom  and create their own independent nation.
 They believe that once they  gather all the magic stones,
 they will transform into their true  forms and inherit great power.
 But in order for them to  attain their true forms,
 they need three more magic stones.
 It was discovered that one of those  stones lies in the Underwater Temple,
 within a strong magic region.
 I'm counting on you, Yami.
 And you, Asta...
 A Black Beach Story
 We were able to complete our  mission yet again today.
 I'm sure our great Captain  Vangeance will praise us.
 Yes.
 But Yuno...
 Yes?
 Sylph, was it? Your spirit  magic is indeed powerful.
 But you need to stop fighting on your own.
 We are a team!
 Yuno is ignoring him brilliantly.
 Got it? Next time, don't ignore my orders  and defeat all of the enemies instantly!
 We will do things according to my plan!
 Are you listening to me, Yuno?
 I am.
 Excellent.
 That scream...
 I think it came from over there.
 I wonder if there's an incident.
 Let's go!
 Give it up!
 No, wait!
 That voice...
 A robbery?!
 Noelle?
 What's going on?
 Th-That's my line!
 Swimsuits?
 Yes, little Golden Dawn boy.
 Little boy?
 We're going to the ocean tomorrow.
 Noelle doesn't have a swimsuit,  so I was helping her pick one out.
 I even told her she could borrow one  of mine, but she doesn't want to.
 It was just strings!
 How could I possibly wear that?
 I-I see.
 Then that scream earlier...
 That's because Vanessa  suddenly took off my clothes!
 Well, it makes no sense to try on  swimsuits while still wearing clothes.
 It's your own fault for  taking forever to undress.
 Right?
 Not a chance.
 What about this one, Noelle?
 I told you, there's no way I could wear that!
 All this fuss over nothing.
 Picking out swimsuits to go to the beach?
 Are you lot just fooling  around instead of working again?
 How rude! This is for a mission.
 A mission?
 Yes.
 An s-e-c-r-e-t one...
 Want to come along, little boy?
 How adorable.
 We don't have any spare time  on our hands, so I'll pass.
 I'd love to go to the beach, but we also have another mission tomorrow.
 I see. That's too bad.
 I-It's my Meal-Saving Prince!
 I would've loved to see you  in a swimsuit, Noelle.
 Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?!
 I wonder what he'll say if  he sees me in my swimsuit...
 I'll send you pics later.
 Glance...
 She's so sexy! She looks...
 so delicious!
 I-I'm flattered!
 Devour me—
 Hurgh!
 Owie...
 Huh? Where's my Meal-Saving Prince?
 The Golden Dawn kids already left.
 La...
 I guess you've already  picked out your swimsuit.
 Now we just need you to hurry  up and pick one, Noelle.
 What about this one?
 I told you, I can't wear that one!
 Then how about this one over here?
 Over where?
 It's a little expensive, though.
 The price doesn't matter.  It's pretty and cute.
 But... it doesn't seem to cover very much.
 Also, what's all that flashy decoration for?
 All eyes will be on you at the beach.
 Eyes...
 I wonder if Stupidsta will notice me.
 Maybe he'll at least compliment me if I wear this...
 Like I care if he notices me or not!
 Um... What would you like to do?
 I'll buy it, okay?!
 Keep the change.
 What?!
 Are you ready, you bastards?!
 My goddess Marie... I wanted  to take you to the beach.
 I wonder if whales are stronger than sharks.
 Sharks have very rough skin. Did you know that?
 Why are you two on my Crazy Cyclone,  totally expecting a ride from me?!
 Well... I can't fly on a broom, so...
 The same goes for me. Did you already forget?
 How stupid are you?
 Who do you think you are?!
 Why don't you guys ride  on someone else's broom?!
 You have royalty like me offering to ride with you.
 You should be thankful, you peasant.
 Seriously, who do you think you are?!
 Is Captain Yami still asleep?
 He said he wanted to check  something out and left earlier.
 Really? It's pretty unusual for  him to actually do some work.
 That's Mr. Yami for you!
 All right! Let's go!
 Crazy Cyclone, blast off!
 The place where Asta and the others are  headed is an oceanfront town called Raquey.
 Raquey has very strong mana,  causing it to be hot year-round.
 This makes it a popular resort getaway  for royalty, nobles, and Magic Knights.
 Why didn't you just use your spatial  magic to get there, Finral?
 I've never been to Raquey before.
 I can't use my spatial magic to go  to places I haven't been to before.
 Tch. You're so useless!
 Now we have to fly over.
 Seriously, I have seniority over you!
 I'm surprised you've never  been there before, Finral.
 I figured you were flirting with  all the girls on the beach there.
 It's always better to save  the best things for last.
 That's why I haven't gone yet.
 I'm so excited to go to Raquey! Wait for me, girls!
 Hey, wait. The guy who's always  awkwardly exhaling steam isn't here.
 Huh?
 I'm right here!
 So wait, that was Grey?
 Then where's the real Gordon?!
 Huh? Guys? Are you still asleep?
 Isn't it time to leave soon?
 Wait... Did they already leave?
 We should be able to see it soon.
 See what?
 The ocean.
 I can't wait! I've never seen it before!
 Me, neither!
 But I still don't see any sign of it.  Is Raquey still pretty far away?
 No, it shouldn't be.
 What are you talking about?
 We've been looking at the  ocean for quite some time now.
 Don't tell me...
 Seriously?
 It's so huge, I couldn't even tell!
 It's beyond my wildest dreams!
 So this is the ocean?!
 This is amazing!
 The ocean... It's so huge!
 Awesome... This is so cool!
 I wish I could show Yuno and  the other runts this view, too.
 What about me?!
 And someday, I'd love to  bring Sister Lily here, too.
 Seriously, what about me?!
 The sunset's so beautiful, Asta.
 Yes... But Sister Lily...
 You're even more beautiful.
 Huh?
 I became the Wizard King.
 So, Sister...
 Whoosh! Open!
 Marry me.
 Of course!
 Just kidding!
 What's he smirking about?
 He'd better not be remembering that k-k-kiss!
 W-Wipe that smirk off your face!
 I-I-It's not like I'd ever  kiss him or anything.
 I'm going to show off this swimsuit  I bought yesterday in front of him!
 D-Don't get the wrong idea!
 I'm just going to show him that  I'm way better than Rebecca.
 I'm so embarrassed!
 But I want him to see me...  But this is still really embarrassing!
 But...
 Hey, Stupidsta! Wh-What do you  think about this swimsuit?
 How do you like my awesome swimwear?!
 Whoa! What the heck is that, Magna?!
 Isn't it awesome?! This is something that  Mr. Yami also uses! It's called a loincloth!
 Dork.
 Let's swim to our hearts' content in this  ocean that's as big as Mr. Yami's heart, Asta!
 You got it, Magna!
 Hey, you two.
 What do you think of my swimsuit?  Doesn't it look great on me?
 It's not that different from  how you usually dress.
 Yeah.
 I guess a virgin delinquent like you  can't understand adult charm.
 Who are you calling a virgin delinquent?!
 Wanna go for a run?
 Man, you're on fire, Magna!
 Shut up, you blasted fools!
 What do you think, Marie?  I made it look just like you.
 Yeah, thanks!
 Hey, Brother, show me the ocean!
 Of course. With pleasure.
 Look, Marie. This is the ocean.
 That's amazing! It's so big and beautiful!
 Next time, we can come here  together and splash around!
 Hey, it's pretty cold...
 Hey, it's Asta! I want to play  with Asta in the ocean someday!
 H-Hey... What do you think?
 I'm giving you permission to  look at me in my swimsuit.
 Anyone who tries to tempt my Marie shall die!
 Hey, Asta!
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray!
 Tch.
 It's so salty!
 Wait, huh?! I can't breathe!
 I can't swim!
 Seriously, look at me already!
 There!
 So, so many hot girls in swimsuits!
 All right! Let's go flirting!
 Grey! Transform into me!
 Yeah! Check it out, yo!
 Okay, Grey! We'll be twins, and our selling  point can be our snappy dialogue!
 What time is it?
 Leave it to me!
 This goes hand-in-hand with the beach.
 If it's food, I know it  like the back of my hand.
 So good!
 Nothing beats having drinks on the beach!
 Charmy, you need to move more to the right!
 Huh?
 Weren't you helping Finral  pick up some girls?
 Yeah, but I got bored, so I left him behind.
 A little more to the left!
 I told you, to the right!
 The left!
 I can tell... Just a little more...
 Just... ten more steps!
 I thought I was a goner!
 Hey, Asta, my swimsuit...
 You're right there!
 Ouch!
 What are you doing, Miz Charmy?!
 If you had hit anyone else, they'd be dead!
 Hey, watermelon juice.
 You don't get it at all!
 Hey! My swimsuit!
 Hey, Asta. It only occurred to me after I  turned into you, but your muscles are gross.
 You should use your transformation  spell for something more useful, Grey!
 You're wasting it!
 My swimsuit!
 Oh, yeah...
 Now what?!
 It's just like I thought! Running on this  sand is excellent training for my legs!
 Look at me in my swimsuit, you idiot!
 You still can't control your magic?!
 You saved my butt this time, but seriously!
 Aw, it went out.
 Hmph. All I can manage without a staff are  defense spells that remain stationary.
 Why are you bragging about that?!
 Ding!
 Bah-ha!
 So this is the famous Raquey Beach.
 The ocean is calling my name!
 Sekke, should we really be playing around?
 Isn't that all we really do?
 Well, I did such a good  job on that last mission...
 that the Wizard King gave me a hundred stars!
 < Lies >
 Bah-ha!
 Captain Jack praised me, too!
 And most importantly, I saved all  the kids from those evildoers.
 < This Is Somewhat True >
 It wouldn't hurt for me  to spread my wings a bit.
 Hey, beautiful ladies.
 Bah-ha?
 Where are you from?
 Home.
 Ah, I see. Want to come play with me?
 Nope.
 Huh?
 W-W-W-W-Wait!
 Wait a sec!
 Look at that loser trying to pick up girls.
 Go on, you two. Go pick up some girls.
 Huh? What about you, Sekke?
 You stupid bah-hastard! I can't do something so vulgar.
 I'll meet up with you guys after you  successfully pick up some girls.
 This jerk! He's planning to show up  and act like he's doing us a favor!
 The only reason you got to come here is  because of me, the Magic Knight, right?
 I gave you a chance. Now, go on.
 Oh, jeez...
 Guess we don't have a choice.
 Look, there are some ideal  babes right over there.
 Bah-ha! Don't worry about me! Let's go!
 You go...
 Hey there, cuties!
 Wanna come talk with us about  how awesome magical girls are?
 Get lost, insects.
 Bah-ha...
 She's from the Black Bulls!
 Wait, does that also mean...
 Take this, damn it! Explosive Scattershot!
 Watermelon!
 Hup! Hup!
 Die! Reflect Ray!
 Bah-ha!
 Bah-ha!
 Oh, dear...
 Did we just run something over?
 Who knows?
 I think we ran into something.
 Nyom, nyom, nyom...
 Wait! Hey! We came here to  look for the magic stone!
 Why are you all playing around?!
 And you're not?
 C-Captain Yami...
 All right, gather round, you idiots.
 I picked up some info while  you were messing around.
 Huh?
 Apparently the Underwater Temple really is at the bottom of the ocean.
 But the mana kicks up the  ocean currents so much that,
 ordinarily, even a first-class  mage can't get near it.
 But on the night of the full moon,
 the mana becomes weaker. We might be able to get in then.
 C-Captain Yami is actually,  seriously doing his job!
 I'm seriously going to murder all of you.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...
 Like the name suggests, the Underwater  Temple is on the ocean floor.
 We can't just walk to it.
 So Noelle...
 Take us there with your water magic.
 Huh?
 Give us a ride there.
 B-But I'd need incredible magic  control in order to do that.
 I can't! You should ask someone else.
 I-I mean, if I fail...
 You're right.
 If you fail, the fierce currents will  take us all under, and we'll drown.
 This is a top secret mission  entrusted to only the Black Bulls.
 No one else can do it.
 You do it.
 The next full moon is a week away.
 Learn to control it by then.
 Surpass your limits.
 Sea Dragon's Lair... Right now, it's my only spell.
 Developing it further should  be the quickest way.
 But...
 Vanessa taught me some magic control tricks before, but none of them have worked.
 Maybe I just don't have the  ability to control magic.
 But even if I don't have talent,  I won't run or make excuses!
 I'll just keep working...  until I figure it out!
 This time for sure...
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 So you were training too, Asta?
 And you too, Noelle?
 A-As if a royal like me would train.
 Let's train together, then.
 Huh?
 If you lose control again,  I'll be able to stop you.
 H-Hmph! That won't happen again.
 Training with just the two of us...
 W-Well, if you insist, I guess I wouldn't mind...
 Um, Asta?
 I hear something.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Look at Me!
 Look at Me!
 Hey, Stupidsta. Look at me!
 How do I look in this swimsuit?
 You're all sparkly.
 Isn't it heavy?
 That'd probably work great as part of a scarecrow.
 You sort of look like a cow back in Hage...
 Wh-What are you staring at?!
 Crab!
 Crab!
 But you told me to look!
 Ugh, I'm so embarrassed...
 Crab...
 Bah-ha! Did you all enjoy yet another  appearance by me, the great Sekke Bronzazza?
 I'm even more bah-hawesome on the beach!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Asta and the other Black Bulls headed  to the beach town of Raquey
 in order to go to the Underwater Temple  that lay deep beneath the water there.
 Asta and the other Black  Bulls received an order
 to retrieve the magic stone in the temple
 so they can stop the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 who want to separate from the  Clover Kingdom and create their own country.

 Where are you going?
 Oh, I just thought I'd let in some fresh air.
 I see. So...
 What's your foot doing there?
 Hey, now, how did that get there?
 This foot is so rude.
 You were planning to forget your work  and go out to play, weren't you?
 What? Now, why would I go out to play?
 I just wanted to go observe some magic—
 You don't have time for that!
 Please do your work for once!
 Hurry up and shut that window!
 Right...
 Honestly... We haven't even resolved the  incident with the Eye of the Midnight Sun yet.
 Don't be so angry, Marx.
 You're gonna die young.
 And whose fault is that?!
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun, eh?
 I hope Yami and the others are doing well.
 I just hope they aren't fooling around.
 I wish I could've gone to  the Underwater Temple.
 I feel sick from drinking too much...
 I'll be the sun that'll make you shine.

 It was yummy!
 I wrote my name on it!
 Other people's food always tastes better!

 Seconds, please!

 We're not here to play! I can't concentrate like this!

 Sorry!
 What a beautiful voice. I wonder if she's from Raquey.
 It's so beautiful and ethereal...
 Are these bubbles magic?
 Whoa, is she a water spirit?
 Eek! You heard that?
 How embarrassing!
 Eek!
 Oh. She's not like what I'd imagined.
 Well, now that you've heard me,  there's no way around it. Let's be friends!
 La-dee-dah!
 Friends?
 I'm Kahono. What are your names?
 I'm Noelle. The meathead is Stupidsta.
 Who are you calling  ""Stupidsta the meathead""?!
 Ah, so Noelle and Stupidsta the meathead.
 What a strange name.
 Wait, don't believe her!  How naïve are you?!
 Huh?
 That's totally a nickname,  and she's making fun of me!
 It's Asta! My name's Asta!
 I see. Nice to meet you, Asta!
 So what were you doing out here, Kahono?
 I was singing.
 Well, yeah, I could see that.
 I was doing vocal training.
 I love singing at this spot.
 Training?
 Yup! I have a dream!
 I want to be a singing, dancing, magic-using...
 idol!
 What's an idol?
 What?!
 You don't know?!
 Nope.
 They're all the rage in the Common Realm and Noble Realm right now!
 Oh...
 Well, you see... So, you see... Well...
 Idols are popular people who  can sing, dance, and use magic!
 Huh...
 I'm going to become a famous  idol and get super rich!
 So you're after money?
 What's so great about money, anyway?
 If you do have it, it's just in the way.
 It's not in the way! Money's important!
 You've never had to worry about not  having money, so you wouldn't understand.
 But money's really important!
 You can't eat tatoes without any money!
 If you don't have any tatoes,  why don't you just eat steak?
 Damned royalty!
 Yeah! Money's really important.
 I totally understand what Stupidsta's saying!
 Seriously, who are you calling ""Stupidsta""?!
 Was it Kasta?
 I told you, it's Asta!
 Oh, right. As—Oh?
 What?
 Stupidsta, your body's weakened.
 It's Asta, damn it!
 Huh?
 What?
 Your muscles are pretty fatigued.
 Are they?
 Do you ache when you move?
 Wait, how can you tell?
 That's my power.
 Power?
 Don't worry. You'll feel better in a sec.
 Song Recovery Magic: Healing Lullaby.
 This is...
 She pinpointed each individual spot. What precise magic use.
 H-How do you feel?
 Well, I feel...
 This is awesome! I don't  hurt anywhere anymore!
 My body feels so light!
 My muscles aren't fatigued anymore!
 Thank you, Kahono! You're amazing!
 I've never seen song recovery magic before.
 Great!
 Okay, that'll be 100 yuls per session.
 You're charging me?!
 Just kidding!
 Good...
 Or not!
 You're really charging me?!
 Money's important, right?
 Here...
 One hundred.
 Thank you kindly.
 Just let me know when you  want me to sing for you again.
 My hundred yuls...
 That's just spare change.
 How is that spare change?!
 I can buy at least ten tatoes with that!
 See? It is change.
 Damned royalty!
 You're both really funny.
 How old are you?
 Fifteen...
 Same here.
 Really? I'm fifteen, too!
 We're the same!
 Really?
 Hey, let's be friends!
 Sure, count me in. You're pretty funny.
 A girl my age... who's a friend?
 This is my first one.
 W-Well, if you insist,  I guess I don't mind.
 I'm willing to be your friend.
 Yay!
 Oh, sorry. I'm so happy, I couldn't help myself.
 Really?
 I see. So you're both Magic Knights.
 That's amazing!
 I-It's no big deal.
 It's to be expected for me. I'm royalty.
 I'm a peasant, though.
 So, what brings you to Raquey? Taking a vacation?
 We're on an important mission.
 We're actually trying to get  to the Underwater Tem—
 Stupidsta!
 The Underwater Temple?
 Sorry, but this mission's a secret.
 Well, whatever.
 So, what were you two up to at this hour?
 Could it be... Eek!
 Wh-What are you talking about? Of course not!
 The moonlight is so romantic, isn't it?
 The sound of the splashing waves  also heightens the mood and... Eek!
 I told you, that's not it!
 I was training, too! Magic training!
 Magic training?
 Y-Yeah. I can't give you the details,
 but I need to learn how to control my magic  within the week before the next full moon.
 Otherwise, this important mission—
 I see.
 So you want to control your magic...
 Hey, Noelle. Show me your magic real quick.
 Huh?
 You can do it, Noelle!
 Wow! That's amazing!
 I see. Good work, Noelle.
 Now that we're friends, I have some advice for you.
 Huh?
 I think you're trying to hold in
 your mana too much when  you try to control your magic.
 Huh?
 Listen closely.
 Can you hear it?
 I listen to the sound of  the waves to calm myself
 so I can use my magic exactly how I want to.
 Exactly how you want to?
 It might just be me, but I think that true  concentration comes from a calm heart.
 From a calm heart?
 I get it!
 I also feel like my best swings happen when  I'm not thinking about anything at all!
 Would you shut up?
 You don't even use magic, and you're  never thinking about anything, anyway.
 What's the kindest memory you have  that brings you the most peace?
 My kindest... memory?
 Yeah. Maybe your family?
 My family...
 To think that the last thing the  one they called the Steel Princess
 gave this world would be someone as useless as you.
 I'll never accept a failure  like you as family.
 Solid...
 Are you seriously Mother's child?
 The House of Silva doesn't  need someone like you.
 Nebra...
 Um, Nozel...
 Why did Mother have to die to  give birth to someone like you?
 You killed our mother.
 Thanks for the advice, Kahono.  I'll try practicing a bit more.
 Let me know if you get tired.
 It'll only be a hundred... No, it'll only  be a thousand yuls, since you're a royal.
 A kind memory...
 Sister, how are you doing?
 You're shining under my sun!
 Are you stupid?
 Not yet!
 Keep it up!
 You're truly a goddess.  My little sister, Marie...
 What the heck is that?
 Are they having some kind of contest?
 Not yet!
 Thanks, Kahono.
 You can just pay me later.
 Of course.
 Not yet...
 I can't drink any more...
 Not yet!
 Noelle!
 Everyone left me...  Won't someone come get me?
 The full moon is tomorrow...  Tonight's my last chance.
 Don't worry! You've almost got it, Noelle!
 There's no time... I still  can't control it at all.
 At this rate, the mission will be...
 I just got a great idea!
 Asta?!
 Noelle! Stop thinking, and set all of your magic free!
 Huh?
 I just remembered!
 That thing from the first time you lost control  would probably go underwater the best.
 Remember what Kahono said earlier?  That you were holding your magic back?
 If that's the case, maybe it'll work  if you just let everything loose.
 A-Are you crazy?
 If it doesn't work—
 I told you! If that happens,  I'll use my sword to save you!
 So don't worry and just go!
 Fine! Don't blame me if something happens!
 I'm releasing...
 all my magic!
 Amazing!
 I knew it! This isn't going to work at all!
 How am I supposed to relax in this situation?
 Noelle!
 Noelle!
 I guess I really can't do it.
 I mean...
 I don't have any... kind memories at all...
 Noelle!
 You can do it!
 You're always talking big,  so what the hell is that?
 And you call yourself a Black Bull?!
 All that awesome magic is going to waste.
 Hurry and learn how to control it so you can fight me!
 It'll be fine! Even if you mess up, you won't die or anything!
 Just take it easy!
 You must be hungry!
 Hurry up and finish so you can eat this!
 Even if you fall, I'll catch you gently!
 If you fall, I'm kicking you back  up there, so make this work.
 Grey Disguised as Magna
 Just get it done, damn it!
 Noelle! You can do this!
 I had some...
 Some kind memories within me.
 So you're Nozel's little sister.
 Your big bro mentioned that you're some  loser who can't even control her magic.
 And that you wouldn't be able to pass  the Entrance Exam even if you tried.
 I've never seen a royal fail before.
 If you'll excuse me...
 Well, if you feel like fighting,  why don't you come join my team?
 Huh?
 The absolute worst Magic  Knights squad, the Black Bulls.
 We're all nothing but losers.
 Meaning we're perfect for you.
 I was with my family for years, but I didn't  have a single pleasant memory of them.
 It's only been a few months since  I joined the Black Bulls, but...
 I have so many memories!
 So many kind memories.
 And...
 They all acknowledged me  and gave me a mission.
 I want to help them!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!
 I... I did it!
 All right!
 The Sea Dragon's Cradle...
 I did it! I really did it!
 Don't get distracted!
 I'll protect the food!
 This feels great after  being in the sun all day!
 Hey, it's my turn!
 I'll be right there!
 Hup!
 Asta! That was my job!
 S-Stupidsta...
 You did it, Noelle!
 Huh?
 Could you not touch me so casually?!
 What?!
 Who the hell are you?
 Thank goodness everything ended well.
 Now, let's drink up.
 Kahono! I did it—
 Huh? Kahono?
 All right! Time to celebrate!
 Yeah! Let's celebrate!
 Here we go!
 You did it, Noelle. You surpassed your limits.
 Well, guess we should get going
 to the Underwater Temple.
 You've got some great friends!
 They're the ones who should be  cheering for you in the end!
 Good for you!
 Well, I'll be waiting for you, Noelle!
 Inside the temple! Okay?
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Song Recovery Magic!
 Song Recovery Magic!
 Song recovery magic?! That's amazing!
 Sing for me!
 Sure! It'll just be ten billion yuls!
 Here you go!
 Okay, I'll sing!
 L-o-v-e! Kahono!
 Kahono Idol Show
 What in the world are you doing?
 Yay! I made some new friends!
 I'm sure you'll be invincible once  you can control your magic, Noelle.
 Let's meet again soon!

42,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 To retrieve the magic stone that  the Eye of the Midnight Sun is after,
 Asta and the others headed  for the Underwater Temple.
 But a strong flow of mana  caused powerful currents,
 making it impossible for anyone to go in.
 The only time the mana would weaken was  in a week, on the night of the full moon.
 Yami ordered Noelle to master a  water spell that would allow them
 to move through the water by then.
 Asta and a mysterious girl  named Kahono encouraged Noelle
 when she was unable  to control her powers.
 The rest of the Black Bulls also joined in.
 And then...
 They all acknowledged me  and gave me a mission.
 I want to help them!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!
 I... I did it!
 All right!
 The Sea Dragon's Cradle...
 Kahono! I did it—
 Huh? Kahono?
 You've got some great friends!
 They're the ones who should be  cheering for you in the end!
 Good for you!
 Well, I'll be waiting for you, Noelle!
 Inside the temple! Okay?
 The Underwater Temple
 Tonight's finally the night of the full moon.
 The mana deep within  these waters will weaken,
 so it's the only day we'll be able  to reach the Underwater Temple.
 You guys better be ready.
 Just you wait, Underwater Temple!
 Just you wait, magic stone!
 Just you wait, unidentified seafood!
 I wonder if they'll have something  rare that I haven't tried yet.
 I wonder who I'll be able  to fight. I can't wait!
 Let's hurry up and go!
 The sooner we go, the sooner we can  go home, and the sooner I can see Marie.
 And I can get back to flirting!
 Looks like you're all set.
 We're counting on you, Noelle.
 R-Right...
 Are you nervous?
 H-Huh? I-I-I'm not nervous at all!
 Everything went great yesterday.
 Aw, you're so stiff.
 Wanna drink this so you can relax?
 Why would you offer her  a drink, you lush?!
 Our lives are at stake here!
 Well, if she's feeling pressured,
 it might not work out, no matter how good she is.
 Noelle, just take it easy.
 But if you mess it up, I'll kill you.
 The pressure's so intense!
 Honestly, what's with you people?
 I feel stupid for even being  nervous in the first place.
 I mean, none of these guys
 believe for a second that my magic will fail.
 Okay, here we go.
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!
 I did it! It worked!
 This is amazing, Noelle, but...
 G-Grey...
 Get off me, you big tub of lard!
 I think I want to kill you.
 Turn into someone smaller!
 How's this, my inferiors?
 Now your ego's inflated!
 Well done, Noelle. I'm counting on you  to get us to the Underwater Temple.
 O-Of course. Here we go.
 H-He praised me!
 This is awesome!
 We're actually moving through the ocean!
 So many yummy-looking fish!
 Look, Marie! This is what it  looks like inside the ocean.
 Hey, get closer to the fish! Marie wants to see!
 I don't have time for that!
 Marie! Marie!
 Let me see your precious face!
 The mana in the water's getting stronger.
 Come back! Marie!
 What's that?
 What the hell is that?!
 Looks like the entrance  to the strong magic region.
 I-Is the mana here really weaker?
 The strong magic region's insane!
 Lady Noe, you'd better be able to handle this!
 You're probably super scared, Magna, since you use fire.
 Wh-Wh-Who are you calling scared, you jerk?!
 You've got this, Noelle!
 La!
 You can do this, Noelle!
 La!
 Go, go, to the strong magic region!
 La! La! La!
 Hey, shut up! I can't concentrate!
 We're just barely avoiding the currents...
 It's as though the mana  is cooperating with us.
 We can do this.
 Crap. I feel sick.
 I'm gonna throw up.
 If you throw up in here, I'll kill you, pervy woman!
 The intensity is decreasing.
 Whoa!
 This is awesome!
 It's so pretty!
 There are so many creatures  I've never seen before!
 That fish is super shiny!
 Isn't that glow... magic? So badass.
 Looks like some of the creatures evolved  a bit further because of the mana.
 I wonder if it's yummy.
 I wonder if its taste  evolved a bit further, too.
 We're gonna go catch it real quick!
 You idiots!
 Do you two want to drown?!
 And Grey, you don't need to  mimic her glutton side, too!
 That's...
 Those whirlpools... They're magic barriers!
 And they're extremely powerful.
 We won't be able to get through like this.
 All right, you're up, kid.
 Go slice through it with  your anti-magic sword.
 Captain Yami...
 Huh?
 You see... coming to the ocean for my first  time made me realize something crazy.
 I can't swim!
 Man, doesn't that suck?
 Who said you need to swim?
 Huh?
 P-P-Please wait! At least give  me time to get myself ready!
 Your time is my time...  and my time is my time.
 What?!
 Ready, and go!
 I can't breathe! I'm gonna drown!
 Huh? There's air.
 Good work.
 Woohoo! We're saved!
 See? You were scared. You even peed your pants.
 I did not, you bastard! They're just wet from the water!
 The mana's too strong! I can't connect with Marie!
 Gauche! Gauche!
 You're on top of me!
 Marie's more important!
 But what a surprise.
 Who knew there was a space  like this on the ocean floor?
 Oh?
 Oh, my.
 So this is the Underwater Temple!
 Charmy.
 Make us some cotton.
 Roger!
 Munchy, munchy, munchy...
 Have a bite.
 Thanks!
 How boring. No one's attacking us.
 True. There don't even seem  to be any trap spells.
 That's a bit disappointing.
 Aw, how boring.
 Don't you dare let your  guard down, you bastards!
 This is the strong magic region!  Be ready for anything!
 Yeah!
 There.
 This is awesome!
 Are these houses?
 Does that mean there are underwater people?
 Are they strong? Are they violent?
 Aren't you guys excited to fight them?!
 That'd be just you, kid.
 Hey! There are people over there!
 Seriously? Underwater people?
 They won't suddenly attack, will they?!
 Shh! They'll hear us.
 Hey, are they...
 Yeah, I think they definitely heard us.
 How rare!
 Guys! We have visitors for once!
 Wait, that robe... Are you a Magic Knight?
 So cool!
 Tell us about the outside world.
 What kinds of missions have you done?
 Okay, okay!
 Leave everything to the great Charmy!
 It's been about ten years  since we had visitors.
 Wait! I was picturing a dangerous dungeon!
 Thankfully, most of the time, what you expect isn't what you get.
 I guess we should find  someone who looks like
 they know something about the magic stone.
 Indeed.
 Well, hurry up and bring out the  boss of this temple. Capisce?
 Captain Yami! You sound  like some gangster!
 Got it! That'd probably be  the high priest! Capisce?
 You can find the high priest  right up those stairs. Capisce?
 I can take you there. Capisce?
 It caught on!
 Hey, you guys are cute. Why don't we  have an underwater barbecue together?
 Right, Gauche?
 Marie is a billion times cuter.
 H-Hey, Grey!
 Why don't you turn into me? We can have that witty twin banter again.
 No one's as pretty as you  in the outside world.
 You turned into Gordon and you're  flirting?! Seriously? Why Gordon?!
 Crab pot, crab egg foo young, crab dumplings...
 Things seem to be going really smoothly.
 Isn't that a good thing?
 Though you're probably not satisfied  if you're not almost dying all the time.
 Uh, it's not like I actually  enjoy almost dying all the time!
 This must be it.
 Tell the high priest hi for us!
 Let's chat some more when you come back.
 Sure, thanks!
 If you do...
 ...actually return, that is.
 There's someone there.
 Is that the high priest guy?!
 Hey!
 There's something really crazy here!
 Hurry up and do something, Asta!
 Wait! It might actually be the  kind-hearted protector of the temple,
 despite how it looks!
 I won't do anything unless it attacks—
 What?!
 What's that big creepy thing?
 They didn't even hesitate!
 Well, well! Looks like we've  got some interesting guests!
 Welcome to the Underwater Temple!
 I'm the high priest here!
 What's with the hyper geezer?
 Hey. That was some welcome, you old fart.
 I just love surprising people!
 Those young 'uns over there had  some delightful reactions.
 You need a better hobby.
 I wonder if he's yummy.
 Uh, Charmy, I wouldn't...
 It just fell apart?!
 It made itself easier to eat?!
 That's my magic.
 Huh?!
 I couldn't eat it.
 I don't know what kind  of magic that was, but...
 He made something that big with magic?
 Who is this old guy?
 You guys are after the  magic stone, aren't you?
 If you want it, why don't  we play a little game?
 Play a game with you?
 And there it is. It's probably  something really dangerous.
 He's calling it a game, but it's probably  something that could potentially kill us!
 I call this game...
 The boob-squeezing game!
 Nobody's going to be playing that.
 Hey! Don't beat on the high priest!
 I think he's really important!
 And I'm royalty!
 Oh, I'm just kidding!
 I think you need to know there are people  in this world that you shouldn't joke with.
 Stop! Let's all respect our elders!
 Hey, old man. We don't have  time to play with you.
 How do you know about  the magic stone, anyway?
 I have pretty good eyes, you see.
 What'll it be? You want the magic stone for your kingdom, don't you?
 What do you wanna do? Send him flying and steal it?
 Yeah, that sounds fast. I'm in.
 That old guy seems like he has lots of magic, so it might be fun to fight him!
 Hey! I'm hearing a lot of  dangerous talk over there!
 Magic Knights aren't allowed to do that!
 There's no way that old man is normal.
 I need to make sure I don't get  pulled into anything troublesome.
 I'm getting sleepy.
 Pardon me, but where's the food?
 And you people don't intend to work at all!
 Haven't you made up your minds yet?
 If you win the game,  in addition to the magic stone,
 I'll gather the temple's  most beautiful girls
 and hold an exquisite banquet  with the very best food and drink.
 Let's do this!
 Seriously?
 Is that more important than the mission?!
 I'll do anything from games to working out!
 Okay, dial it back a bit.
 All right, old man. We'll do it.
 This gaming expert will take you on.
 You go, Mister Yami! You're the  biggest player of them all!
 So what are we playing?
 Dice? Roulette?
 A white-hot...
 Temple battle royale!
 Yeah!
 Temple mages, come on out!
 Game Magic: Temple Shuffle!
 What're those?
 New passages?
 You called, High Priest?
 Finally! Mages from the outside who  made it to the Underwater Temple!
 I'm so excited!
 Still... They don't look that tough.
 The fish are talking!
 Huh? What was that, punk?  Look at your lame-ass masks!
 The magic's just rolling off these guys!
 Are they the warriors from  the Underwater Temple?
 Well, then. Why don't we get started?
 Wait, already?
 And start what?
 All right, then.
 Let the games... begin!
 I'm not ready yet!
 What the heck, man?
 Where am I? Where is everyone?
 Test, test, test. Can you all hear me?
 You've been scattered to different  areas inside the temple.
 So we're still inside the temple. Awesome!
 Starting now,
 you'll face off against the  temple mages, nine-on-nine.
 Where's the food?
 Come to think of it, I don't  know any attack spells yet!
 Wait. Nine?
 There should be ten of us... We're missing one.
 The rules are simple.
 If you knock out your opponent, you win.
 If your opponent gives up, you win.
 I think I sobered up a little.
 Victory goes to the first team  to wipe out the other team,
 or whichever team has the  most members left in the end.
 I wonder who I should turn into next.
 You can fight however you'd like!
 You can fight one-on-one or even run away.
 You can find your friends  and fight together, as well!
 This sounds way too violent.
 Fine! I'm gonna run like  a bunny. Go for it, guys!
 However, my nuisance spells  are out there, so be careful!
 Nuisance spells?
 Just you wait, stupid geezer.
 Yay! This is awesome!
 A blood-soaked battle! I'm super pumped!
 That's so easy to understand!
 All right! Bring it on!
 Oh?
 That's funny...
 I can't seem to sense any magic from you.
 Can you actually fight?
 Good grief. Guess I picked a loser.
 Wanna find out if I'm  actually a loser or not?
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 There Are Ten of Us
 There Are Ten of Us.
 You called, High Priest?
 Sorry to call the nine of  you here without warning.
 Sadly, I have some bad news.
 Huh?
 Something felt off, so I counted again, and there's one extra.
 One extra?
 What do you mean?
 Your numbers.
 What?!
 That's impossible!
 Unbelievable! That means there's  elephantly an impostor among us!
 What's the elematter?
 Wh-What's the matter?
 You're not a sea creature, are you?
 Oh, come on! You're elenuts!
 What's your favorite food?
 Bananas!
 And your best feature?
 My long nose!
 Which makes you...
 Elephantly an elephant!
 So you are the impostor...
 Elephantly an elephant...
 Weirdo...
 What's all that racket?
 Welcome to the Underwater Temple!
 What's with that look? You want  the magic stone, don't you?
 Go on and fight, then! Go!

 Asta and the others finally  arrived at the Underwater Temple.
 But once they got there...
 You guys are after the  magic stone, aren't you?

 ...a mysterious old man called the high priest
 and nine temple mages were waiting for them!
 The high priest told Asta and the other  Black Bulls, who were separated,
 that if they wanted the magic stone, they must battle the temple mages, nine-on-nine.
 Victory goes to the first team  to wipe out the other team,
 or whichever team has the  most members left in the end.

 Temple Battle Royale
 Now, then, why don't we watch from here?
 I've got plenty of food and drink!
 Hey, you old geezer, don't leave me out of the game!
 I got all pumped up, but now I'm sad.
 You're a bit too strong.
 All the people outside, as well as myself, are very excited for this game.
 It'd be no fun if it were to end quickly.
 Looks like you really do get it, gramps.
 You've got good taste.
 I do, don't I?
 Ooh, it looks like a few  match-ups have already begun.
 All right. If any of mine lose, I'll kill 'em.
 So cold... Damn that geezer.
 He's gonna pay for this!
 Hilarious!
 You're at a total disadvantage with  fire magic in a place like this.
 Looks like I win.
 I'd rather not pick on  frail-looking guys like you.
 Are you gonna fight me?
 I know you guys.
 You're the Black Bulls, aren't you?
 You're the weakest of the Magic Knights.
 Marie's waiting for me. Hurry up and come at me, damn it.
 Just so you know, it's pretty pointless  for you to wave around that rusty sword.
 My mollusk magic can  parry any kind of attack.
 I see...
 Isn't this exciting?
 Oh, by the way, what are your knights' ranks?
 They're all junior magic knights.
 I'm surprised you even know  about that, living down here.
 According to your ranking system,
 my temple mages would be more powerful than intermediate knights!
 Those juniors don't stand a chance!
 What? Really?
 Well, that's not good...
 Unless those idiots are actually  stronger than usual for their titles.
 Wh-Wh-Wh-What?!
 Don't think I'm gonna get discouraged  just because I'm surrounded by water.
 I'm gonna serve all of you up like grilled fish!
 He must've been one of the weaker ones.
 So... I wonder where  all the strong ones are?
 Good grief.
 I need to finish this nonsense quick so I can go back to doting on Marie.
 This... isn't right...
 My mollusk magic should be able to  deflect any kind of physical attack.
 My sword is anti-magic! That junk won't work!
 What?
 Next, next!
 Good job, you idiots!  Beat the crap out of them!
 Those fools let down their guard!
 Hey, gramps, I forgot! We should  bet on which team is gonna win!
 I bet 10,000 yuls on the Bulls!
 Grr... The battle's just begun!
 They won't be able to defeat the  remaining priests so easily!
 Especially the Three Great Priests,  who are on par with senior knights.
 Badump, badump...
 Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak...
 Whew... Man, that was close.
 There's no way I could fight  a guy who looks that strong.
 I've been trying to get to the places I  marked outside, but I can't for some reason.
 That means I can only use my spatial  magic to get to places I can see.
 Oh, I forgot to mention this,
 but you won't be able to leave my  playground until the game's over.
 Whoa! Are you watching me, gramps?!
 Hey, Finral, why the hell are you hiding?  Hurry up and fight, or I'll kill you!
 Huh? Yami?!
 Wait, are you with the old guy?
 We're enjoying some food and drinks  while we watch you guys fight.
 What?! Come on, make him  stop this violent game!
 What? It's fun to watch  because it's so violent.
 That's right!
 When did you two hit it off so well?!
 It's definitely no fun if  you're not gonna fight.
 Don't let that coward get away.
 There we go! Nuisance spell activated.
 Game Magic: Monster Toy.
 Scary!
 How entertaining! I should use more of these!
 Hey, you old geezer...
 Let's do this one next.  This'll probably kill them!
 Are you sure you're actually on their side?
 Nice drawing, though.
 Now, then... Let's see how  the others are holding up.
 That bastard Grey turned into a crab,  and I don't know where he went,
 so I'll just have to kill him later.
 Oh? Is Charmy battling?
 S-Such destructive force...
 Th-The Underwater Temple is amazing.
 And so is its seafood!
 S-So good! Munchy, munchy...
 This is the best I've ever had!
 So this is the Underwater Temple's seafood!
 I wish my meal-saving prince  could have some, too!
 Okay! This entire ecosystem is mine!
 I'm going to eat absolutely everything!
 That one there... What exactly is she doing?
 Heave-ho! Heave-ho! What a huge haul!
 Found you!
 La?
 My, what a cute little target. I almost  feel bad that I'm going to defeat you.
 So you're finally here.
 But right now, I'm overflowing  with undersea mana.
 If you want me to chew you up  the way I chewed up those fish,
 bring it on!
 Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.
 I feel so nice...
 Why, yes, I can still eat more...
 One down!
 Just so you know, sleeping counts as a K.O.
 How do you like the power  of one of my Great Priests?
 She's not getting any food for a week.
 Now, then...
 I wonder if I'll see those two next.
 All right! My clothes are finally dry!
 Let's see... Who am I gonna fight next?
 Hey, Luck. I guess you're still alive.
 Yup! I defeated one of  the enemy guys already.
 I headed this way because I felt a  strong presence over here, but...
 Looks like I was right...
 All right... let's decide who  gets a piece of 'em fir—
 Hey! No fair, Luck! You bastard!
 Ya snooze, ya lose, Magna!
 Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Shield.
 It's tough! My lighting should work  pretty well against water, though.
 Well, well, aren't you lively?
 What the heck are these things?!
 This ki... Someone's there.
 Come on, Grandpa. Do you really have  to hit us with your nuisance spells, too?
 Well, whatever. That was a good warm-up.
 Hup!
 He took out something that huge? Who the heck is he?
 Hey, there!
 You're Asta, right?
 Huh? Yeah, that's right...
 I've heard about you! You use a strange  sword that cancels out magic, right?
 Uh, yes... Wait, who'd you hear that from?!
 Never mind that! Check out this dance!
 The hell?! He just started dancing!
 But it's a really cool dance!
 Do you think they'd like this  dance up on the surface, too?
 Heck yeah!
 The name's Kiato!
 My dream's to become a dancer who  captivates the whole kingdom!
 He just started talking about his dream?!
 Although people from the Underwater Temple can go to the kingdom's beaches,
 we can't go to the capital.  It's against the rules.
 But if we win this fight, Grandpa said...
 Oh, the high priest is my grandpa.
 Anyway, he said we could use the high  priest's authority to go up to the surface!
 I'm gonna make a name for myself  and become a super famous dancer!
 He just told me all about this huge dream!
 Hey, wait a sec...
 This all seems pretty familiar.
 So listen...
 I'm gonna take you down  for the sake of my dream!
 He's fast!
 I have my own dream, too!
 Huh?
 I wanna become the strongest man  who protects the Clover Kingdom,
 the Wizard King!
 So for that dream...
 I'm gonna take you down!
 I like it!
 Then let's bet our dreams on  a head-to-head showdown!
 Bring it on!
 Wh-What am I going to do? I haven't  learned a single attack spell yet.
 Hey, there! I finally found you!
 Sh-Shoot! I'm in trouble!
 Y-You want to take on  a royal such as myself?
 You've got some guts! This is your  chance to run away if you want!
 First off, I'm glad you  could make it, Noelle!
 H-How do you know my name?
 Oh, right. I guess you can't  tell with this thing on my face.
 Huh?
 Kahono!
 I've been waiting for you, Noelle!
 Kahono... I had no idea you were  from the Underwater Temple.
 Why did you help me learn magic?
 I was actually looking for people who  wanted to come to the Underwater Temple
 while I practiced singing on that beach.
 You see, when we have guests, Grandpa... I mean, the high priest, always holds games.
 If I win, I'll be able to go to the surface
 and make my dream to  become an idol come true!
 Your dream? Then you used me?!
 Huh? No.
 It's true that I wanted to help you,  since you were working so hard,
 and it's also true that I wanted  to become friends with you.
 But from now on, we'll fight fair and  square as opponents in this game!
 No! We're supposed to be friends!
 Yup!
 Friends are people who can clash over  things that are precious to them,
 but keep smiling together even then!
 Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.
 What is this spell?
 I-It's going to make me...
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
 Now you're ready to fight?
 Song Magic: Destructive Beat!
 Come on, now, Noelle!
 You'll never win if you just keep defending!
 What do you think you're doing?!
 She only let off some magic  energy, but look at that force!
 Amazing!
 Huh? What're you doing, Noelle?
 An attack like that won't  have any effect on me.
 Aim straight! That sucked!
 Shut up!
 I still can't control my magic  when I'm attacking, you idiot!
 That's not it. You're already  controlling your magic, Noelle.
 Huh?
 You're subconsciously trying  not to attack people.
 You must not want to hurt anyone.
 But are you sure you're okay with that?
 Why did you come here, Noelle?
 Didn't you come here to  make something come true?
 If you don't fight for it and win it,
 you'll never get what you want!
 I... want to be useful to everyone!
 Fine!
 This guy's really strong!
 And what's with his moves?
 It's like his mind's gone somewhere else.  It's really hard to read his ki!
 I think he's even throwing off my senses.
 Is this his magic?
 It's just like I thought.
 If you're going up against a real sword,
 your anti-magic sword is nothing  more than a lump of iron!
 And if I add in my dance magic, you won't be able to follow my moves!
 How do you like my grandson? Isn't he strong?
 Yeah, the kid definitely  knows how to handle a sword.
 But...
 Come on, now! Just surrender already, Asta!
 This isn't good! I'm about to lose!
 He really is like water.  There's no way to catch him...
 Wait, maybe brute strength  isn't the way to go here!
 I probably shouldn't try to capture water, since it has no distinct shape!
 Anyway, I need to calm down.
 That's it!
 I will also become like water!
 Monkeying around won't get you anywhere!
 Don't sell a monkey short!
 I can't use magic!
 And that's why...
 I'll recreate magic with my body!
 Pretty sure there are limits  when you can't use magic!
 What?
 In that case...
 I'll use this chance...
 to go beyond my limits!
 Jeez... Just how athletic is this kid?
 My idiot's ability to pick  things up quick is even greater!
 What a rude man... Trying to set up a sneaky  trap for a defenseless woman like me.
 You can't really complain if you  fall for a trap yourself, can you?
 Seriously? Vanessa's usually drunk and  useless before she gets warmed up.
 We're in top shape today.  I should've bet more, damn it.
 These guys aren't junior mages at all!
 But man, that lady's got some nice boobies.
 Hey, old man. Could you get  that magic stone ready?
 A really dangerous lot called the  Eye of the Midnight Sun is after that stone.
 It'd be in your best interests  to just hand it over to us.
 The best part of a game  is turning the tables.
 You can't get lamer than bluffing, old man.
 I'm not bluffing!
 If my son and grandkids get serious,  we'll turn things around in an instant!
 My son is the strongest mage  of the Underwater Temple!
 Uh-oh... I think you're getting tired, Magna.
 You can take a little break.
 I couldn't feel better, you idiot.
 You butt out, Luck.
 Sorry to drag you into  my dad's game like this.
 Dad? You're that geezer's son?
 He's strong... His magic  is as deep as the sea.
 No doubt about it... He's definitely  the strongest one here.
 You two should come at me at once.
 I'd rather not hurt you  any more than I need to.
 At the very least, I'll end  all this in an instant.
 Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!
 You ain't ending anyone, you bastard!
 I'm not done having fun yet!
 Huh?
 Wh-What was that?
 Wh-Wh-What the heck's going on?!
 Looks like you're having fun.
 Why don't you let us join in?
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Why Don't You Let Us Join In?
 Why Don't You Let Us Join In?
 Looks like you're having fun.
 Why don't you let us join in?
 Munchy, munchy...
 La?
 I-I must've come to the wrong place.
 Munchy, munchy... Have a bite.
 Have a bite, 'kay?
 Well, if you insist, I guess I'll... join in.
 I'll let you join in...
 After you stir that pot.
 Those who will not work do not get to munchy!
 Stir, stir, stir...
 Put your back into it! It's not all about strength!
 I see... This is quite deep.
 And so, Vetto realized his dream to become  a chef and gave up on the magic stone.
 Then everyone lived happily ever after!
 That probably won't happen, huh?
 Of course not!
 To make the Eye of the Midnight Sun's dream come true,
 I, Vetto of the Third Eye,  shall obtain the magic stone!

44,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 In search of the magic stone, Asta and the  others arrived at the Underwater Temple,
 where they were forced to participate in High Priest Gifso's game, the Temple Battle Royale.
 According to your ranking system,
 my temple mages would be more powerful than intermediate knights!
 Wh-Wh-Wh-What?!
 Don't think I'm gonna get discouraged  just because I'm surrounded by water.
 Magna and Luck also participated in the game, hoping to get the magic stone.
 Ya snooze, ya lose, Magna!
 Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!
 Well, well, aren't you lively?
 My son is the strongest mage  of the Underwater Temple!
 He's strong...
 No doubt about it... He's definitely  the strongest one here.
 You two should come at me at once.
 I'd rather not hurt you  any more than I need to.
 Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!
 You ain't ending anyone, you bastard!
 I'm not done having fun yet!
 The one who appeared  before Magna and Luck
 was one of the Eye of the  Midnight Sun's top brass, Vetto.
 Looks like you're having fun.
 Why don't you let us join in?
 The Pointlessly Direct Fireball and the Wild Lightning
 Oh, it's a full moon tonight.
 I wonder if Asta is looking up  at the same moon right now.
 Oh, silly me!
 Bah-ha? I guess I fell asleep—
 Bah-ha?!
 Hmph. Not even good for a warm-up.
 You're just a pack of mice.
 Let's go.
 Yes, sir.
 Bah-ha...
 I know we were all on vacation, but there  were a number of senior Magic Knights here!
 And they were all defeated by one guy...
 What were the Magic Knights we  believed in so much all about, then?
 That thing wasn't human.
 That was...
 a beast!
 Where'd this macho dude suddenly come from?
 He looks pretty hardcore.
 Aw, that shark guy was my prey.
 All I know is... This guy's magic  power is greater than Captain Yami's.
 You made it through  the rough ocean currents
 and then forced your way in here...
 That's some incredible magic, all right.
 Oh? I guess you can still move.
 Ow...
 I'm pretty sure you're not a Magic Knight.
 What brings you to the Underwater Temple?
 We're after the same thing as those  two over there, the magic stone.
 I see. But it's not like I'm  just going to hand it over.
 Oh, I don't expect you to just hand it over.
 We're going to lay waste to everyone here, make you despair, and seize it!
 What are you...
 Scatter and spread despair!
 Yes, sir!
 Well, you're all rather rude, abrupt guests.
 Could you head on home now?
 Hey, you.
 That's also a pretty rude  way to address someone.
 If you want to get your way,
 do something about it, and hit me with all your magic.
 Looks like you're completely  underestimating me.
 I may not look like it, but I am the  strongest in the Underwater Temple.
 Enough talk! Say it with your magic!
 Well, if you insist...
 Water Creation Magic: Sea God's Hammer!
 Beast Magic: Rhinoceros Armor.
 It didn't even faze him.
 That's not a bad spell, for a mouse.
 Let me give you a reward.
 A reward?
 Yes, a reward called despair.
 This world is all about the  survival of the fittest.
 The strongest beasts survive, and the  weak vermin live only to become prey!
 Beast Magic: Bear Claw!
 Did you get a good feel for how  vastly different our powers are?
 You insects aren't even  allowed to hold on to hope.
 I-Impossible...
 The temple's greatest warrior, Gio,  is being defeated so easily.
 I've never seen anything like this.
 Hey, gramps. Playtime's over.  Hurry up and get me in there.
 Well, if you insist...  But who in the world is this man?
 He's one of the leaders of a nasty terror  group called the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun?
 I don't have time to explain. We're short on time, so hurry it up.
 Sadly, I can't.
 We can't leave here until the game is over.
 I can't even undo the spell.  Those are the rules of my magic.
 I see.
 What are you...
 Then I'll just let myself out.
 Say what?
 Dark Magic: Lightless Slash!
 Wh-What in the world?!
 Tch.
 This is...
 Spatial Magic: Different Dimension Sphere.
 Once you're trapped in my spatial magic,
 no matter who you are, you won't be able to escape.
 Black, foreign swordsman...
 The mana tells me you're here.
 Stay there and watch for a while.
 You're going to be my main dish...
 After I season you with despair,  as you watch all of your friends die!
 If he gets out, the temple's done for.
 Hey, gramps.
 Wh-What?
 Can you make it so they hear us out there?
 Huh? S-Sure...
 But what are you going to do?
 Testing, testing...
 That's the captain...
 Hey, you dumbasses, listen up.
 Captain! I beat one!
 Someone really dangerous  just crashed the game.
 He's one of the leaders of  the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 and a beast of a man strong enough to go  head-to-head with a Magic Knight Captain.
 It's him...
 Also, three of his underlings  are over there, too.
 Hurry up and hand over  that yummy-looking food...
 Here's the problem... Due to reasons,  I can't go over there.
 What?! What do you mean, ""reasons""?!
 Meaning you guys gotta  do something about him.
 You can't be serious!
 Listen up.
 All of you, surpass your limits, right here, right now.
 If you die, I'll kill you.
 That's all.
 Live...
 He's insane.
 I never thought the game  could get so exciting.
 It's a game that'll determine the fate  of the Underwater Temple, blast it!
 The game rules have changed!
 No time limit.
 To clear the game, defeat the Eye of the Midnight Sun's team.
 Those who contribute to clearing the game
 will get any wish that's  within my power to grant!
 There's an absolute monster here...
 Damn it.
 I'm scared, but...
 That makes him worth fighting even more!
 I'll do this... I'm gonna do this, damn it!
 Asta...
 I guess we'll have to put  our match on hold.
 Kiato...
 All right, let's go!
 Yeah!
 Now, then... Who's my next prey?
 Not yet...
 Who said you could move on to the next?
 We're still alive, you know.
 After what Mister Yami said,  I can't just lie here napping.
 Besides...
 I'm not...
 ...going to break!
 Excellent.
 The more stubborn the prey, the better  it is when they're finally in despair!
 Well, we managed to get back up,
 but how the hell are we supposed  to fight that monster?
 If he lands even one more decent  blow on us, we're finished... So...
 Hey, you.
 Hit us with another one of those.
 What?!
 That really fast one.
 Damn it, Luck! What the hell?! Are you stupid?!
 We just barely managed to block that attack,  and we both still took a ton of damage!
 Oh? So you're imitating me. Very well.
 I'll keep giving you despair...
 until you die!
 Just what I thought! That spell leaves a  split-second opening right after you attack.
 So you're already matching my pace.
 You've got good speed and sharp  senses, I'll give you that!
 Huh? My Thunderbolt Destruction  didn't work at all!
 I'll play with you for a while!
 You speedy little...
 That battle maniac... Damn it.
 So you're Magna, huh?
 What a weird haircut.
 I'm Luck. Nice to meet you.
 Is this the guy who's called the Smiling Combat Fiend and Luck the Cheery Berserker?
 I need to show him who's boss.
 Nice to meet you, too, loser.
 Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
 Wow, what a funny face.
 Ever since I joined the squad, he was an  annoying pest who messed with me constantly.
 His personality was...
 ""This dude's got some serious issues.""
 Hot, hot, hot, hot...
 Take that!
 Hot!
 Even on our missions, he would do insane things.
 Take that!
 Huh?!
 It's the Crackling Magna Typhoon!
 I had no choice but to admit that  he has great battle instincts.
 And since that dungeon mission,  he's gotten even stronger.
 I hate to say it, but you're my best friend.
 Damn it...
 Don't...
 Don't you dare leave me behind, you dumbass!
 Flame Creation Magic: Grand Slam!
 I'm gonna crush it over here!
 Nice, Magna!
 Take that!
 When I first met you, I underestimated you.
 A peasant, huh? He looks boring.
 But my instincts warned me...
 They told me, ""This guy's gonna  be dangerous, yet interesting.""
 You interested me so much  that I kept messing with you.
 That pudding you were  saving sure was delicious.
 That's going to be your last supper!
 You always struck back at  me with everything you had.
 I just now realized...
 that you're my...
 You're my...
 That you're my very first friend.
 Magna! I bet you've got even more in you!
 Shut up!
 Nice catch, Fireball Gangster!
 Who are you calling a gangster?!
 Get off me, Lightning Boy!
 That's enough playtime, don't you think?
 Bring it on, you jerk!
 We're just about warmed up, too!
 This way!
 How can you tell when you  can't even sense mana?
 I can't sense mana, but I can sense ki.
 Ki? It's true that I sense a  strong magical power up ahead.
 And it's incredibly powerful.
 I've never felt anything like it before!
 But as you said, we've got to do this!
 Hey, your ki earlier...
 It was hard to sense your presence. How were you doing that?
 Oh, by dancing, I unconsciously  put myself into a trance.
 A trance?
 When I'm in that state, my body moves  without me even having to think.
 Then my opponents can't predict my movements.
 I see! So that's actually possible...
 All right!
 Whatcha doin'?
 Putting myself into a trance.
 I've got a clear view of that magic now!
 Flame and lightning magic are fighting!
 Flame and lightning...  It must be Magna and Luck!
 Their opponent has huge magic and...
 What is this?
 It's like hundreds of raging beasts!
 It must be Vetto! Wait, you can tell all that?
 My tribe's eyes are good at picking up magic.
 But if this is who we're up against...
 Nah.
 Those two are crazy, but when it comes  down to it, they're both super reliable!
 They definitely won't die!
 Ow...
 Do you finally get it?
 The weak get eaten, and all  they have left is despair.
 Despair?
 Like we have time for that, you dumbass!
 Yup...
 If we were in despair...
 We'd be too embarrassed to  act like his superiors again!
 Not yet...
 Not yet...
 We know...
 that if we fight him normally, we probably won't stand a chance.
 Not yet...
 That's why... not yet!
 That slight opening we have  right after he attacks...
 Right now!
 We'll hit him with all the magic we've got!
 A simultaneous, full-power, body  and soul attack at close range?!
 Is this what they were trying to do?
 Magna... Luck...
 This mana...
 This power is insane.
 Combo Magic: Flame Lightning  Explosive Cannon!
 Magna! Luck!

 Crackling Magna Typhoon!
 Crackling Magna Typhoon!
 Hey, everyone! How are you doing?
 We can't hear you! Put a little  more umph into it, damn it!
 Today, we're going to show you how you can  do an easy Crackling Magna Typhoon at home.
 First, have a string of lightning ready.
 No one can do that!
 Then, you wrap that lightning  string around Magna, like this.
 It's electrocuting me!
 Oh, you'll have to get your own Magna.
 They can't do that, damn it!
 Once you wrap the lightning  string around him,
 you're going to spin him with  all your strength like a top.
 Just like this! Take that!
 And that's the Crackling Magna Typhoon.
 Easy, right?
 You're the only one who can do this, damn it!
 Save me!
 See you next time!
 I'll never give up, no matter  how powerful my enemy is!
 Not yet! I'm... We're the Black Bulls!

 Wh-What is this magical discharge?
 Even a combo spell that powerful  couldn't scratch him.
 Magna, Luck... You were true men.
 You better stand strong, too,
 kid!
 The Guy Who Doesn't Know When to Quit
 In the end, you're nothing more than insects.
 I gave you the chance to fight back,  and this was all you could do.
 Now, take this! The despair called death!
 An anti-magic sword...
 Good of you to come, boy.
 That guy's from the  Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 This is the perfect opportunity.
 I'll make you feel the pain Licht felt many times over!
 Just like those insects at my feet.
 They're not insects.
 They're my teammates!
 And as their junior, I'll take on  the duty of bringing you down!
 I see. So this is what a slash from  the anti-magic sword feels like.
 If you were to get a clean hit on me,  I probably wouldn't stand a chance.
 It definitely had more of an effect than  certain-kill spells from most mages.
 Then act like you're hurt, you bastard!
 Just what are you guys planning to do  by gathering those magic stones?
 We know you're up to something!
 I have no reason to tell you,
 a piece of no-magic trash unloved by mana.
 What?
 Well? Come at me.
 You can join the rest of the insects.
 He even got Dad?
 This guy's total magic power is  on a completely different level.
 The magic that flows from him  grants constant protection.
 I'll massacre everyone here, then take  my time searching for the magic stone.
 I didn't forget about the ones outside.
 Hopefully the scum out on the frontier can  keep me at least mildly entertained.
 People I love... My family, and those who  are just like family to me, live here.
 I'll never let that happen!
 Let's go, Kiato!
 You got it, Asta!
 He only grazed us, yet he's still so powerful!
 He's reading our ki!
 And he's so fast that there's almost  no point in reading his ki.
 Kiato, I guess you weren't going  all-out when you were fighting me.
 Apparently, neither were you.  You have another sword!
 How boring.
 Slow movements and weak attacks.
 I suppose I can't expect more from  no-magic trash and hick scum.
 You sure know how to hurt a guy's  feelings, you hairy gorilla.
 We'll show you what happens when  trash and scum get serious!
 That's it, Kiato! You can do it!
 That bastard's still not fazed one bit.
 I can feel it all the way over here...
 Magic that's terrifyingly powerful.
 Listen up.
 All of you, surpass your limits, right here, right now.
 The captain actually  sounded serious for once.
 I guess this isn't the  time for me to be drunk.
 Crap! This is definitely not good.
 If I end up face-to-face with that guy, I'm definitely going to die!
 On the other hand, if I just hide somewhere, Yami's going to kill me later.
 What the hell am I supposed to do?!
 I'd like a bucket of that pudding, please...
 A bucket...
 Tch. I was about to wrap things  up and go see Marie, but now...
 Stop getting in the way  of my flirting, damn it!
 Sucks to be you.
 Now that you've run into me,
 the most powerful chain magic user  in the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 you'll never get to see your Marie again.
 The hell did you just say?! Don't think  you can get away with saying that!
 Mirror Magic: Reflect R—
 It's no use! My chains immediately  detect attack magic and strike!
 Chain Magic: Scorpio Chain!
 Come on, now! If you're  too slow, it'll sting ya!
 You stupid small fry! You can  dial back that confidence!
 Mirror Magic: Real Double!
 Ah, yes... My chain won't be able  to keep up if there are two targets...
 If I only had one, that is!
 And then...
 Reflect Refrain!
 W-Wait!
 Die.
 And I hope you die without leaving a trace behind!
 You had me sweating for a second.
 This bastard...
 Chain Magic: Heavy Chain!
 To pay you back, I'll squish you with these!
 Tch...
 Damn it!
 There's no point in running, you coward.
 That bastard looks and sounds like  a weakling, so I thought I'd be fine,
 but he's stupidly strong!
 Now, where are you hiding?
 As much as it pisses me off,
 that bastard's magic is pretty  solid for both attack and defense.
 The only chance I really have is if he underestimates me.
 But...
 He already saw my Real Double.
 How am I going to...
 Hey, come on. Come out.
 I guess this is all I should've  expected from the Black Bulls.
 What a worthless group of pathetic losers.
 Shut your mouth!
 You stupid face!
 There you are!
 You thought you could  use the same trick twice?
 I-I'm scared! Save me!
 How pathetic, you moron...
 Die!
 You're the moron.
 Wha— Another one?!
 Mirror Magic: Large Reflect Ray!
 I-Impossible... I already  defeated your double...
 Too bad for you. That's not my double.
 He fell for it! He fell  for it! He fell for it!
 That's right! I, Grey, used transformation magic
 in the middle of the battle  to turn into Gauche!
 That guy was pretty tough,
 but I never thought I'd run into  you transformed into a crab.
 You better thank me!
 Stop doing weird stuff in  my form! I'll kill you!
 Ow, ow, ow... Please stop...
 I used up a lot of my magic,  but there are more enemies.
 We're gonna find them and kill them.
 You got it!
 Yeah, my bad... I twisted my ankle  during that fight back there.
 You can't be serious!
 Hurry up and transform into  someone that's not me.
 I know. Transform into a crab.  Then you'll have plenty of legs.
 Nope! I need magic to transform.
 I shouldn't be wasting it, right?
 Hey, stop for a sec.
 I'm pretty sure it was somewhere  around here that I saw...
 There she is!
 Ah, yes... the only way to eat cake  properly is with your hands...
 Domehead!
 Why the hell is she sleeping?
 Dunno. She was like that when I found her.
 Well, anyway, even that glutton can  help us fight. Let's wake her up.
 I can't move!
 Tch...
 These vines are draining our magic.
 No! It's sucking away my strength!
 Vine Trap Magic: Bind Vine.
 Two of the same face? One of you  must be using transformation magic.
 You bastard!
 A g-g-g-g-ghost!
 Regardless, I was able  to catch two this time.
 I'll make you as useless as  this one with my vine magic.
 No! Stop!
 Please stop!
 But you guys sure are easy.
 I just randomly set my trap  magic in various spots
 and waited until you morons fell into it.
 Now all I have to do is wait for your magic  to drain, and then I get to torment you.
 Talk about easy.
 This isn't good. He got my grimoire, too.
 I can't activate my mirror!
 Domehead must've been a decoy.
 Once you set your fork down, the meal is over...
 Hey! Damn it, Domehead, wake up!
 That jerk, just snoozing away over there...
 No! Please stop!
 I don't want to die yet!
 Even if I wanted to fight back, Grey  can only use transformation magic.
 They're all useless!
 I'm just going to have to do something  before all my magic gets drained...
 on my own!
 We're supposed to be a team!
 I protect you! You protect me!
 Then we'll be able to fight forever!
 That's right.
 I was this close to ending up  right back where I started!
 Hey! Hey!
 My magic! My magic!
 It's getting sucked away!
 Gauche! Hey! Do something!
 Shut up!
 Think. How should we fight?
 We've got a bastard who can only  transform and can't fight,
 and a domeheaded glutton who's fast asleep.
 Well, aren't you a yummy-looking cut of meat...
 Hey, Grey!
 Can't you...
 Stop struggling. My vines have already  sucked away most of your magic.
 It's impossible to defeat me.
 I've been wondering this  ever since you showed up,
 but aren't you a bit old to be acting like this?
 How rude! I'm only twenty!
 There's no time to waste! Let's do this!
 Okay, Gauche!
 There!
 What the heck is that?
 Hey, Domehead!
 Somebody's trying to steal your food!
 Huh? But I'm a vegetarian...
 Hey.
 Step away from that meat.
 H-How is her magic so immense?
 There's... a beast?
 I-I'll drain your magic, too!
 I've set a trap over there, too!

 Gauche! This isn't meat!
 I hate to admit it, but her  attack power is insane.
 Grey. You can do better, too, can't you?
 Huh?
 I've seen other guys use transformation  magic where they transform themselves,
 but I've never seen anyone who can  transform something else like you.
 I think you could probably  use that a bit more.
 Right...
 I used up more magic than I thought!
 My transformation's coming undone!
 Meat, meat, meat...
 Huh? Grey's transformation's coming undone?
 Come to think of it, I've never seen Grey's true form!
 What does he look like?
 Isn't he that big guy?
 Grey (True Form)
 What?! Grey's a girl?!
 I-I'm so embarrassed!
 Please don't look!
 I can't move an inch. All I can  do is stare at Marie's picture.
 My angel will help me regain my strength.
 H-He really isn't looking at Grey.
 Oh, so that's what you look like.
 I-It's so humiliating to have  people see me in my true form!
 If I'm not transformed, I feel like  I'll die from the humiliation! Save me!
 Well, aren't you a cute young lady?
 Oh? How old are you, hon? La?
 I'm 24...
 La! You're five years older than me?!
 And I can't even deal with the fact that  you're the same age as me, Domehead.
 What?! You're also nineteen?!
 I have barely any magic left.
 How are things going over there,  you hot-headed shrimp?
 Go!
 Did you get your hopes up?
 These childish attacks won't work on me!
 Not yet...
 No-magic trash! Prancing around  with weapons too good for you...
 You don't have a shred of hope.
 Let me tell you why!
 One...
 You're weak against throwing and  other long-distance attacks.
 Especially with objects that have no magic!
 Two...
 You're weak against those  whose physical abilities
 are magically reinforced  to be greater than yours.
 So what?!
 Three...
 You don't know when to quit!
 Boy... You actually think that  as long as you don't give up,
 it'll work out somehow, don't you?
 That arrogance causes you to keep recklessly  attacking opponents you can't defeat
 and makes it easy to mortally wound you.
 The idea of trash like you holding  the Demon-Slayer Sword and the
 Demon-Dweller Sword makes me sick!
 You're talking nonsense again.
 You never had any hope of winning.
 Now... scream! Despair!

 Magical Detective Charmy!
 Hello, I'm Magical Detective Charmy.
 A terrible crime has been committed.  Someone has eaten my cake.
 To uphold my honor, I will  capture this vile criminal!
 You're the culprit.
 The criminal was bold  enough to go into my room!
 My bedroom!
 You're the damn culprit.
 But the criminal made a grave mistake.
 Look at this handprint!
 That's your handprint, isn't it?
 The culprit is...
 You, right?
 It's me!
 Duh.
 The ocean's such a lovely restaurant!
 I need to hurry up and finish this mission  so I can eat those fishies and clams!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Vetto from the Eye of the Midnight Sun  suddenly appeared before Asta and the others.
 He came to steal the magic stone  that was in the Underwater Temple.
 Let's go, Kiato!
 You got it, Asta!
 How boring.
 Slow movements and weak attacks.
 I suppose I can't expect more from  no-magic trash and hick scum.
 You sure know how to hurt a  guy's feelings, you hairy gorilla.
 We'll show you what happens when  trash and scum get serious!
 Asta and Kiato struggled, but Vetto was just too strong.

 Song Magic: Rhythm Cushion!
 Thanks, Kahono.
 That'll just be a thousand yuls.
 I'll pay you back a hundredfold.
 Can you heal everyone with  your song recovery magic?
 I can, but do you think that guy's  going to wait for me to finish singing?
 That's...
 Hey!
 Big Brother! Why are you sleeping?!
 What happened to our promise to become an  idol and dancer, and then become huge stars?!
 We were going to become sibling  idols who could sing and dance!
 That's right!
 Huh? He's your big brother?
 Yup. That moron over there  is my big brother, Kiato.
 Who are you calling a moron?!
 Ow...
 If I hadn't softened the blow of  that punch with my dance magic,
 he would've taken my head off.
 He's unbelievably strong.
 But...
 The two of us dream of going to the surface!
 That's right! If we want to fulfill that dream,  we can't just sit around napping!
 Let's go, Kahono!
 Yeah!
 Her mana's getting stronger?
 Combo Spell:
 Sea God Slash!
 Sea God Slash is a song  and dance combo spell.
 Dancing to Kahono's song  reinforces my dance magic,
 and unleashes magic slashing attacks!
 Amazing...
 Kiato! Kahono!
 You can do it! The two of you have got this!
 You've worked so hard ever  since you were little.
 I guess that's enough for today.
 No way. We'll never get rich if  this was enough to tire us out.
 You're right. We can't become stars that way.
 Yup. Besides, we need to make sure our  song and dance will please the sea god.
 Yeah, so we need to work harder.
 Okay, let's do this.
 Yeah!
 Your hard work...
 ...won't betray you!
 Oh? All this power
 from a little bird's song  and a mouse's dance.
 Frontier magic is truly intriguing.
 That's right! This spell was  created because we're here!
 We served the sea god, praying,  singing and dancing...
 We spent a long time that way,  weaving the magic into our lives!
 That's right! Ever since we were  little, we've offered up this song
 and dance to the sea god  and the rest of our people!
 This spell...
 ...is our bond with the people
 of the Underwater Temple!
 You can do it!
 Kiato! Kahono!
 Go, Kiato! Kahono!
 We're not going to let you...
 ...break that bond!
 Did they do it?
 So what?
 No way...
 Wha...
 Kiato!
 Big Brother!
 Kiato!
 Run, Kahono!
 Dreams? Bonds?
 People like you have no right  to talk about such things!
 Kahono!
 Curse you!
 Game Magic: Monster Toy!
 Every last one of you thinks this is some child's game.
 We're the ones who truly  have dreams and bonds...
 We, the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 The ones you broke...
 Our golden dreams and our bonds of blood!
 What is that fool talking about?
 You devil!
 Now you won't be able to perform your  silly songs and dances ever again.
 In other words, your cheap little  dreams just went down the drain.
 Well, weakling? You grounded little bird...
 Did you get a good taste of despair?
 I don't like those eyes.
 In that case, I'll have to rip  off your wings one by one...
 A bird that can't sing has no reason to live.
 I'll just...
 Stop!
 Let her go!
 You think you can stop me with words?
 If I miss, I might hit Kahono...
 You never had any hope of winning.
 Now... scream! Despair!
 I couldn't attack earlier, either.
 In any case, would my attacks  even work on someone like him?
 Are you finished? Then just  watch from there, you loser.
 Everyone's fighting, even though  they're getting torn to pieces.
 And yet, I...
 I...
 It's all right.
 Kahono?
 That immense power inside you...
 You'll be able to control it now, Noelle!
 Because you're fighting to protect  what's important to you.
 You're fighting to win!
 What's important to me?
 You'll be fine! There's no doubt about it...
 Because I'm your friend, and I say so!
 Hey...
 It's shaking?
 Wh-What's going on?
 So you finally showed up,
 Noelle!
 I'll tell you one more time.
 What is this power?
 Let my friend go!
 Black Bulls girl,
 you're not letting what your  siblings said get to you, are you?
 There's no time for that on the battlefield!
 One wrong decision and a life could be lost!
 You're standing here right now  as a member of the Magic Knights!
 If you joined the Magic Knights  of your own free will,
 then steel yourself and get stronger!
 Steel myself?
 Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of.
 However, staying weak is!
 Let my friend go!
 This power...
 Girl, you're royalty?
 So what if I am?
 That has nothing to do with this!
 I'm Noelle Silva of the Black Bulls!
 How dare you hurt my friends and comrades?!
 I see...
 I knew it.
 You're from the most corrupt clan!
 Very well!
 Come at me with all of your strength!
 I'll force you and that  sinful mana to your knees!
 I'll defeat you,
 whether you ask me to or not!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Th-The sea god?
 I did it!
 Take a look at that power!
 Noelle, you little... I think you  might've killed your limits there.
 She's the sea god incarnate...  No, she's a goddess!
 I always figured she had  incredible latent ability,
 but who would've thought she  was such an attack mage?
 Come live with me.
 It's not you who should despair.
 It's the people of the Clover Kingdom.
 Remember...
 your true self.
 May you two be happy!
 What...
 This can't be!
 The humans?!
 I'll kill them!
 Impressive... You managed  to draw me out, human.
 What's with that eye?
 And this eerie magic I've  never felt before...
 Mythical Beast Magic...
 N-No way!
 What in the world is that?
 He regrew the arm he lost?
 There isn't any magic like that!
 The best that even the most powerful  recovery spell can do is close wounds.
 These guys aren't just terrorists.
 They're something weirder...  Something abominable!
 Run... Get out of there, Noelle!
 Run?
 I...
 won't run!
 That's some fine resolve for an insect.
 Now, it's payback time.
 Vanish!
 Mythical Beast Magic...
 Sea Dragon's...
 That last spell drained all my magic!

 Very well, insect. I'll tell you.
 Who are you calling an insect?! I'm royalty!
 This is the spell!
 Easy, right? Read it.
 I can't read that.
 It's...
 Say what?
 It's...
 Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers?
 That's not it at all!
 It's...
 The only difference between a  whale and a dolphin is their size?
 Udon
 Somen
 Hiyamugi
 The only difference between udon, somen,  and hiyamugi is how thick they are!
 Hawk
 Eagle
 Apparently hawks and eagles  are the same birds, too.

 Of course I knew that! I'm a royal!

47,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Vetto of the Third Eye, a part  of the organization known as
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun that  seeks to destroy the Clover Kingdom,
 infiltrated the Underwater Temple.
 His power was so great that Asta and the  others fell to him, one after another.
 Kahono!
 Let her go!
 But Noelle diligently faced off with Vetto
 in order to protect her friends!
 I'm Noelle Silva of the Black Bulls!
 How dare you hurt my friends and comrades?!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

 It looked as though Noelle's attack  had finally defeated Vetto,
 but the battle wasn't over yet!
 Impressive... You managed  to draw me out, human.
 What's with that eye?
 Mythical Beast Magic...
 N-No way!
 La?
 Bah-ha! I'm going to go get help.
 You two tend to as many people as you can.
 Bah-ha?
 What's this horrifying mana I'm sensing  from the bottom of the sea?
 Is it the beast from earlier?
 No, this is even worse. It's no beast.
 It's a monster that's way  more powerful than a beast!
 What is this ominous mana?  I've never felt anything like it before...
 Does Lord Vetto's power concern you?
 You must be buzzing with confidence,  to look away from me.
 Vetto?
 That's one of the people  the captain mentioned.
 One of the Third Eye, the strongest group  in the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 He's the one who infiltrated the temple?
 Sucks for you, though.
 You'll be exterminated here.
 I'm going to suck all the magic out of you.
 That's not going to happen.
 I'm going to defeat you and find my comrades!
 The way he looks...
 It's almost like one of the fairy tales  Granny used to tell me.
 Long ago, there were evil fiends  that lived in this world.
 They wanted to make this world  and all of its magic their own.
 The strongest among them used forbidden magic
 to turn himself into a  demon of incredible power
 and tried to exterminate humanity.
 The one who stood against him later became the first Wizard King.
 This man is just like one of  the fiends from that story.

 I can't leave them alone!
 Useless, useless, it's useless!
 I told you.
 No one's ever escaped my Spatial Magic:  Different Dimension Sphere.
 You bastard! Hurry up and let me  out of here, or you'll be sorry!
 Got it?
 You hear me?
 Answer me, you bastard!
 Ooh, well, aren't you scary?
 What the hell are you laughing at?

 You bastard! It's too late to apologize now!
 Wow...

 Man, this guy is violent.

 This sound's going to make me go crazy!
 What's the matter? It's like you've suffered a painful bite.

 Let's see how long you  can keep buzzing around.
 We're going to destroy you Magic Knights
 so that we, the Eye of the Midnight  Sun, can fulfill our great desire!
 Not able to run anymore?
 M-My arm won't move?
 Is it just your arm that won't move?
 Wh-What's going on?
 Thanks for moving closer to me.
 If you were too far away,
 my threads would've been  blown away by the sound waves.
 I told you, didn't I? That I was going to  defeat you and go to my comrades.
 Wh-Why, you...
 Thread Magic: Dancing Doll!
 M-My body's bugging out on its own!
 Y-You pest!
 Suck up as much magic as you want!
 But you'll have to settle for your own.
 M-My magic's... being sucked away...
 Goodness. I'm going to replenish  all the mana that was wasted on you.
 Now, then...
 Wait for me.
 I'm surprised you can still stand, anti-magic brat.
 But it's futile.
 What can you do when you're so beat up?
 My overflowing mana
 whispers to me that I should show you  vermin what true despair looks like.
 Asta... You're badly hurt. How did you get up?
 Kahono... used the last of  her strength to heal me.
 Huh?
 With a faint song...
 Little by little.
 Kahono...
 Let's pulverize this guy and heal  both Kahono's throat and Kiato's leg.
 Huh?
 I mean, even he managed to regrow an arm.
 I'm sure there's someone out there  who can use magic to heal them!
 Oh, yeah, Noelle...
 That insane spell you did earlier...  It helped me get back onto my feet.
 You're just as awesome as I thought you were!
 Leave the rest to me!
 Asta!
 Nope, nope, nope, nope,  nope, nope, nope, nope!
 What the hell are you talking about, Asta?!
 Nope, nope, nope, nope,  nope, nope, nope, nope!
 What the hell are you talking about, Asta?!
 Leave the rest to you?  Look how beat up you are!
 What can you do in that state?
 Especially against a monster like that?!
 Not to mention...
 Allow me to introduce them.
 They are the strongest three  in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 The strongest?
 Yes... In combat, they surpass me.
 The Third Eye!
 They're more powerful than you?
 Third Eye, eh?
 He has to be bluffing when he says  they're stronger than him.
 He wasn't bluffing!
 He does have much stronger magic than Licht,
 the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 There's no way we could beat this guy, even if we ganged up on him!
 Everyone else is already down for the count...
 And he made this giant  hole with no problem!
 Okay... I'm going to escape through that hole.
 I can't! There's no way I can save them!
 I need to at least escape, or we'll all be wiped out!
 Brat, how pathetic you are.
 What can you do in that condition?
 Shut up! Don't get cocky just  because you got another eye!
 Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope,  nope, nope! That guy's totally right!
 Asta, this is impossible!  That guy's magic is insane!
 There's no way you can win!
 You should hurry up and run!  No, seriously, run away!
 You mentioned earlier that one of my  weak points is that I won't give up.
 It's not a weakness!
 Not giving up is my only weapon!
 And I'm never going to give  up until I fulfill my wish!
 No matter what!
 Not giving up is a weapon?
 I will show you just how  useless that weapon is.
 I'll show you exactly what despair means!
 Before I defeat you lot, I should  probably take out the trash first.
 You bastard!
 Mythical Beast Magic...
 Don't!
 Oh, dear... Big and hairy over there
 must be the insane guy named Vetto  the captain was talking about.
 You're way more ugly than I thought you'd be.
 Definitely not my type.
 Vanessa!
 Vanessa!
 Maybe I should've just passed out drunk.
 But you really are insane, little boy.
 Still...
 You didn't give up, and that's why I'm here.
 Go on and pull me along with you!
 Thanks!
 I was wondering why the other  Black Bulls liked you so much,
 and I think I finally get it.
 Right, Captain?
 That's right, kid. Just like what Vanessa said.
 Because you didn't give up, Noelle,
 Gauche,
 Magna, and Luck
 were all able to go beyond their limits.
 And... me, too.
 A heart that refuses to  give up is your only weapon?
 Rubbish!
 Did you really think that these cobwebs
 could keep a beast like me tied down?
 What fun would it be if you  actually stayed tied down?
 Shut your mouth.
 Do you truly think you can defeat me just  because another insect joined your cause?
 Mythical Beast Magic...
 I won't make it in time!
 So there was still another mouse hiding?
 Ugh, honestly...
 You guys are so into this.
 Finral!
 Oh, my.
 My juniors are working hard.
 That means I have to act like a proper senior.
 Crap! What the heck am I doing?!
 I'm gonna die!
 I'm impressed you actually showed up. Good job, Finral the wuss.
 O-Of course I showed up!  I'm no wuss, Vanessa!
 Don't give up! Don't give up!  Don't give up! Don't give up! Don't give up!
 You vermin...
 No, you're ants. Less than vermin.  No matter how many of you gather,
 you won't even be able to scratch me.
 Noelle, you have enough magic  to protect everyone, right?
 Y-Yes.
 We're counting on you.
 Still... his magic is unbelievable. Honestly...
 Yeah.
 But you can't see it, right?
 Of course, I can't see it,
 but I definitely feel his ki.
 If he manages to hit us head-on with any  of his attacks, it'll instantly be over.
 It's life or death right off the bat!
 It hurts, damn it! I want to cry!
 If we get out of this alive,  I'll give you a hug.
 A hug?!
 You can cry all you want right into my bosom.
 For real?!
 Finral's ki just blew the hell up!
 Controlling guys is child's play.
 And for you, ordinary magic attacks  won't work on him at all.
 You and your anti-magic will  just have to take care of this.
 Make sure you don't let go of  that sword, no matter what.
 Got it!
 Go give it all you've got.  Put your life on the line.
 Yeah, Asta!
 I swear that we won't let you die!
 Asta... Everyone...
 Mythical Beast Magic...
 Let's go!
 My long-range attacks never  even touch the anti-magic sword.
 The spatial magic user just  sends them right back at me.
 For a mere human, he's quite fast and accurate.
 Jeez, this is scary!
 But I've gotta do this!
 In that case...
 I'll just have to pick  them off at close range!
 You wish!
 The power of the spatial magic and your aura are gushing all over the place!
 What?
 The thread changed his trajectory...
 You scuttling little insects!
 I'm going to defeat you...

 hogging up all the screen time.
 Okay, here we go.
 So this is service magic! I wonder how Mimosa's doing.
 Woohoo! That was a total success!
 Look at those perfect bodies!

 Good work, little boy! Keep it up!
 No, wait! I didn't even do anything!
 It's all thanks to you two!
 Amazing... These two are this powerful?
 As I thought, I cannot heal.
 Did he sever the magic current  that enables self-healing?
 The one weapon here that has a chance  of defeating me... that anti-magic sword.
 If I only had to deal with that unskilled  brat, there would be no issue,
 but those two are supporting him and giving him mobility.
 The spatial magic is troublesome,  but the real nuisance
 is that woman's thread magic!
 Her magic runs through this whole space,
 interfering whenever and  wherever she wants.
 It cannot attack or bind me personally,
 I can barely see it, and it's too  thin for me to detect its magic.
 That means I won't be able  to read that brat's moves!
 How amusing.
 To think that three people  who are worthless alone
 could fight me by banding together...
 It makes me sick.
 Don't think that you have hope just  because you've banded together, humans!
 He's coming!
 Let's go!
 Got it!
 Finral!
 Got it!
 Not yet, damn it!
 He did it!
 No! That wound's too shallow!
 We won't be able to defeat him  just by scratching him like that!
 This'll make things even  more dangerous, but...
 We need to let the kid get even closer!
 I'm all for getting closer! Bring it on!
 I'm not imagining it!
 What the hell is this ridiculously  huge and creepy magical power?
 This is even more ridiculous than the  ridiculous magical power I felt earlier!
 We could say that it's now super ridiculous!
 Shut up! Stop saying stupid crap!
 P-Please don't look at me!
 More importantly, have your  powers recovered at all?
 U-Um, not at all yet.
 I used all my powers against  that steel ball lardbutt.
 I can't shoot even a single Reflect Ray now.
 At this point...
 Hey, domehead! You're going  to have to go ahead, and...
 Munchy, munchy, munchy...
 Are you seriously still  eating at a time like this?
 La!

 One Hit
 eats up my magic, so I'm left starving.
 Two Hit
 Mega Hit
 We can't fight on such empty stomachs!
 We all need to eat and recover  as much magic as possible!
 Well, I guess you have a point.
 We should also eat and recover some magic.
 O-Okay!
 Take that!
 The Magic Knights haven't lost yet!
 You can do it!
 They're up against a crazy monster,  but they still might have a chance!
 That's it! Keep it up!
 Offense is the best defense!
 Don't give him time to counterattack!
 How dare you leave my son and  grandchildren in so much pain?!
 Please get revenge! Beat him to a pulp!
 Not bad...
 Those guys never work together,  but now, by working together,
 they've surpassed their limits.

 It happened again. He held his  ground against their attack.

 How long am I supposed to keep  up with this tense situation?
 Barely missed!
 Get a grip! This is no time for whining!
 Asta is holding his own against that monster!
 Compared to that, this pressure's nothing!
 Finral! Do you still have some magic left?
 I-It's going down at an enormous rate, but I'm still managing!
 I mean, I spent all this time  running away and not fighting,
 so it works out in the end.
 So it doesn't mean that our movements  have gotten any slower...
 Huh?
 This isn't good.
 His timing is starting to match our attacks!
 I guess it's about time...
 Asta!
 This is nothing.
 One of his attacks just happened to graze me!
 Let's do it again!
 Hold it, kid!
 Captain Yami?!
 You should be the first one to know that
 he didn't just happen to graze you, since you're the one fighting him up close.
 That bastard was purposely  not attacking as much
 and defending instead to better  understand all of your habits.
 Wh-What?
 If you barge in unprepared...
 He's definitely going to get you next time.
 If you barge in unprepared...
 He's definitely going to get you next time.
 N-No...
 As expected from the Black Swordsman.
 That's why I'm saving you for my main dish.
 But what difference does  knowing that fact make?
 This situation is still filled with despair.
 Insects, this next attack will be your last!
 You don't get to decide that, you hairy gorilla!
 You, too, Captain! We won't know until we try!
 I know, damn it! Because I'm a  bazillion times stronger than you!
 Then stop watching and come help us!
 Really? You're going to say that?
 The thing that's bugging me the most?!
 When I'm barely able to keep my blood  from boiling in this dumbass situation...
 Hey, kid! You need to calm down, too.
 I didn't say you couldn't attack him.
 I'm just saying you can't keep doing  the same thing. He's going to kill you...
 Unless you guys change!
 Finral!
 Vanessa!
 Kid!
 Yes, sir!
 You know exactly what to do
 in situations like this!
 Right here, right now...
 We're going to surpass  our limits even more!
 We're surpassing our limits  and speeding things up!
 Got it!
 Asta!
 A draw?
 Not yet!
 Let's keep on surpassing our limits!
 Got it!
 Of course!
 Take that!
 Little boy... when I see you fighting  with your little body and no magic,
 it gives me a courage that's frankly unlike me.
 I had forgotten. I didn't  want to remember...
 how weak I was back in  the Forest of Witches.
 Hey, did you know that beyond  this forest is a huge city,
 and a lot of people who live  there aren't even witches?
 Vanessa, you've told me  that hundreds of times.
 All the other witches are out playing,  aren't they? Getting boyfriends and stuff.
 Why don't you also escape  from this cage and go out?
 What? I-I could never do that!
 I can't defy the Queen of Witches.
 C-Come on, cheer up.
 Do you want me to talk to the  Queen of Witches for you?
 That's impossible! You're all  dolls I created with my magic.
 If I can't do it, there's no way you could do it.
 You're right. Besides, this whole  conversation is just you talking to yourself.
 Hopefully you'll be able to make  some real friends someday.
 That's impossible... How could I?
 I'm always going to be stuck here.
 I'll never be free.
 That was my fate.
 I thought I didn't have a choice.
 But...
 One day I realized that this wasn't fate. I just lacked courage.
 I wasn't wrong for choosing to leave the  Forest of Witches and become a Black Bull.
 Only you have the power to  move the threads of fate!
 Little boy, I'll pull! Just trust me and go!
 I'm counting on you, ma'am!
 Curse you insects!
 Come on, you two! You're going way too fast!
 I swear... this is the problem  with hot-blooded people!
 I've always been the guy with no motivation!
 Finral...
 What is that fragile and  stunted spatial magic?
 We of the House of Vaude are a family  of attack spatial magic users that
 have been Magic Knights for generations.
 You can't fight with magic like that.
 But I don't want to be violent or  have people be violent toward me.
 You weakling!
 Goodness! Look at how much  you managed to shave off!
 You're so amazing, Langris! A genius!
 We'll just have someone  rebuild what he destroyed.
 You don't have to worry  about a thing, Langris.
 Honestly... Aren't you ashamed to  be outdone by your younger brother?
 To think that the difference in  your abilities was this great.
 Langris is now the vice  captain of the Golden Dawn.
 And yet you're...
 ...the pack mule for the weakest squad, the Black Bulls.
 We're appointing Langris as the  next head of the House of Vaude.
 I doubt you have any objections.
 Of course I don't. I was just thinking that'd  be too much for me to handle myself.
 Langris, take care of our family for me.
 I don't take orders from you, Finral.
 You bring shame upon the Vaude family!
 You've got a point... but I'm  pretty popular with the ladies.
 I ran away from my parents, my brother, my home, and reality.
 Hey there, cuties!
 Let's go have some tea. There's a  fancy café just around the corner.
 You girls are so cute,
 you're going to make me say things  even sweeter than those sweets there.
 In the midst of that, Asta, I met you, a kid with absolutely no magic.
 It's not that you didn't have enough...
 You had nothing, but you faced yourself, kept fighting, and never gave up.
 It's true that how I am now, I'll never beat my brother.
 But...
 Say, Yami.
 Why did you let me join your squad? I can barely even fight.
 So you can take me everywhere.
 Huh?
 Oh, right... It's not like I can  defeat any enemies with my magic.
 You've probably got your own  way of fighting, right?
 Huh?
 I'm saying that battling doesn't  just mean defeating enemies.
 My own way of fighting...
 I'm not going to become the strongest.
 But I'll make the Black Bulls the strongest squad!
 I had abandoned my own fight.
 When I did, there were words  I couldn't say anymore.
 But now, I can say them!
 Asta! Believe in me!
 Trust me and jump in!
 Sorry, but I already believe  in you 100 percent!
 Not bad for insects!
 But you must be nearing your limits.
 If even one of you makes the  smallest mistake, you'll die instantly!
 How long can you hold up under  such extreme conditions?
 Shut up, beast guy!  Until we beat you, of course!
 Asta just told me that he  believes in me 100 percent.
 I knew that! Otherwise, he could never  fight using this ridiculous method!
 Honestly, how can you trust a drunk woman
 and a superficial wimp with your life?
 If you believe in us so earnestly...
 ...we can never betray that trust!
 I see. That's some  magnificent concentration.
 But how about your magic powers?
 They'll probably reach their limits soon.
 The amount of magic we have...
 That's the difference between  myself and you insects!
 H-He sure knows how to hit where it hurts.
 My spatial holes are becoming smaller.
 My threads are screaming.
 I'm almost out of magic, and the  threads are about to break.
 So what?!
 I'm going to believe in them both and win!
 It's not just them.
 Guess we got here in time.
 La!
 Gauche! Charmy!
 And...
 Grey. It sounds like some terrible joke,  but apparently, this is her true form.
 What?!
 P-Please don't look at me!
 We can talk later.
 Take this! This is all the  magic I have right now!
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!
 What's the matter, insects?
 You think you'll actually hit me  just by attacking more?
 Nah, I accomplished what I wanted.

 I-It's my transformation magic!
 I don't have much magic left, so some  may not look exactly like him...
 Bring it on!
 Domehead! Keep hitting  until you run out of magic!
 Lai-lai, sir!
 You pesky insects! Despair already!
 Despair?
 We don't have time for that!
 Petit Clover

 Trinity.
 Listen carefully. I'm going to use  my thread to change your direction!
 Then, I'll use my spatial magic  to move you somewhere else!
 But if we miss even once, you'll be finished!
 Are you ready?
 Yeah! All we can do is charge!
 Here we go, Gordon!
 Green light!
 I believe in you two!
 We can never betray that trust!
 Green light... Red light.
 What?!
 I can't tell when Gordon's done saying,  ""Green light, red light,"" at all.
 I'm so sorry, Asta.
 He's just too strong.
 This is so much fun. You're it next, Asta.
 I'll make sure I get to you.
 Oh, no. I sense that my  friends are in trouble.
 I want to help you all. Please stay safe.
 I hope my feelings reach you all.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Working together with his friends,  Asta continued his battle with Vetto.
 But...
 Vetto was able to overcome  those attacks, too.
 Not bad for insects!
 If even one of you makes the  smallest mistake, you'll die instantly!
 In this life-or-death situation,
 Asta continued to swing his sword,
 believing in his friends  and in their victory.

 I'm falling down because of a twist of fate
 The harmony we had is in the past
 Still left behind
 The scent of you is stuck in my head
 Can't shake it
 Waiting just isn't enough anymore, Yai yah!

 We did it!
 Yes!
 Finally...
 We won!
 Is that what you thought?
 Did you think your puny strengths  combined would actually work against me?
 Well? Did you?
 I let you hit me on purpose, in a non-vital  spot, so I could steal your weapon!
 N-No...
 I know that once you lose all hope, the most unmistakable despair is created!
 Fall into the darkness of despair!
 Asta!
 Kid!
 That's right! That's the way I wanted to hear you humans scream!
 Now, fall fully into despair!
 Despair! Despair! Despair!
 Despair! Despair! Despair!
 Despair! Despair!
 Despair! Despair!
 Despair! Despair! Despair!
 Despair!
 As...ta...
 How do you like that, insect?! I'd like to see you try to stand again now!
 ...yet...
 Not yet!
 Not yet...
 I'm not...
 giving up yet!
 Asta... You're so...
 He's right. We're not...
 ...giving up yet!
 Curse you!
 Vanessa!
 You're not getting away!
 How'd you like that, you despair freak?!
 That's the last of our magic!
 La!
 We'll never give up.
 We'll never lose
 to someone like you!
 Asta, are you all right?!
 He's different from us.
 He was born without magic into this  world where magic is everything.
 But... Perhaps the gods of fate didn't  give him magic because he's like this.
 He's someone who's going to make  it to the top in this world.
 We need to let him fight and guide him!
 Little boy, I'll support your broken arm!
 Thanks, Miss Vanessa!
 Now I... can still fight!
 We're doing this again, Finral!
 Right!
 I'm going to do this! No matter  how many times it takes!
 I still have one sword left!
 Why?
 Why won't you despair?
 I told you! I don't have time for that!
 There's someone I can't lose to!
 You and despair... are in  the way of our promise!
 Silence! You insects can be swatted away!
 I've already seen through your movements—
 My eyes can't keep up with his movements.
 Because the Demon-Dweller Sword is still embedded in me,
 the magic I was using to increase  my physical abilities has weakened!
 I thought that I had stolen his weapon.
 But are you saying it was my  weapon that was actually stolen?!
 There is no way that I would lose... against you humans!
 You haven't won against anyone!
 Did any of them actually give up before you?
 No one has despaired!
 Shut your mouth!
 Asta!
 My magic... But...
 This time I'll end you for good—
 Not yet...
 Not yet...
 I'm not giving up yet!
 He's the same as me... No...
 He's no beast.
 The three leaves of the clover represent faith, hope, and love.
 Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.
 Within a fifth leaf...
 He's... a demon who devours even despair.
 Grey words can't make anything happen
 I know, yeah I know
 Wishing to fly freely across the sky
 I dreamed it all my life
 Step by step I go, though  it's a doubtful world 
 Don't care how much I fall
 Instinct is my guide, I never give up
 To faraway future, I burst out running
 Go beyond even the unseen fears
 The vision I had, so I can be myself
 Despair...
 Someday I will write the next page
 You've lost!
 You are my hope
 Like that page from someday
 I was able to meet you
 I call this a miracle
 His magic disappeared.
 Th-There's no question this time!
 We won!
 How do you like that, you bastard?!
 Asta!
 Little boy!
 Well done! I'm so proud of you!
 I knew you could win, little boy!
 You're so amazing, la!
 Thank goodness you didn't despair!
 Damn... That shrimp is full of guts.
 Guys...
 That hurts! I'm injured all over, remember?!
 Oh... Sorry.
 He did it! He defeated that beast!
 What was the power that came from the kid earlier?
 That kid's amazing!
 I thought we were done for!
 Thank you, Magic Knights!
 Thank you so much!
 Miss Vanessa, how are their wounds?
 They're deep, but none of  them are life-threatening.
 Finral, do you think you can transport  them with your spatial magic?
 I'm exhausted. I think it'll take a  little longer for my magic to recover.
 You're so useless, you coward.
 Useless?! I have seniority, damn it!
 I hope Kiato and Kahono will be  able to dance and sing again.
 Jeez. Do you really have time  to worry about other people?
 Look at how beat up you are.  And to think you actually believed in us.
 There's something seriously  wrong with you, Asta.
 Yeah. You never know when that  coward Finral will run away.
 Yup, yup...
 Hey, that's mean. Though it's true  that I did want to run away.
 But when I saw Asta, my body moved on its own.
 Little boy, because you didn't give up...
 Because you believed in us, we were able to win.
 Thank you.
 What are you talking about?
 You're my seniors, who Captain Yami  accepted into the Black Bulls.
 Of course I believe in you!
 You sure know how to make a girl smile.
 Stop making your seniors cry.
 You've got some great seniors, la.
 I'd expect nothing less from the  juniors that Captain Yami accepted.
 Well, I'm pretty sure he's the  only one who'd ever accept
 someone who has no magic.
 Hey, I'm one of your juniors too, you know.
 Noelle! I heard you did great, too!
 You learned some insane new attack spell, right?
 That's right! The Sea Dragon's Roar!
 It was seriously amazing!
 Y-Yeah! You'd better compliment me more!
 And she's cute to boot!
 This royal's basically a celebrity!
 Y-Yeah! That has nothing to do with the  battle, but keep the compliments coming!
 And just once more...
 D-D-Don't get any weird ideas!
 I wasn't even thinking!
 Oh, sorry.
 All right! Let's have a drink  to celebrate our victory!
 Now's not the time to drink!
 We need to figure out a way to tie up  that guy and haul him outta here.
 He has an eyeball in his forehead and  said something about my sword...
 But most of all, he's one of the  leaders of the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 There's a lot we have to ask him!
 Vetto... Vetto...
 Stop crying, Vetto.
 Those damn humans... hurting this tiny little bird...
 I can't forgive them.
 I chased them away. Let's go  home and tend to its wounds.
 I'm sorry that you always  have to save me, Licht.
 What are you talking about?  We're friends, aren't we?
 I'll always save you.
 We're just like this bird.
 Because it can fly, like we can use special magic,
 they envy and want to hurt us.
 But I believe that one day, we and the humans will be able to understand each other.
 Licht... I'm sure if you  say so, it'll come true.
 Hope, eh?
 It's a very sweet notion.
 To me, Licht was... yes,  he was hope personified.
 But the ones who stole  that hope away from me...
 were you humans!
 This magic...
 You're kidding, right?
 I'm taking you all down with me... No...
 I'll blow this whole temple to smithereens!
 Th-That's...
 That bastard!
 Even they won't be able to stop that.
 Let me the hell out of here!
 It's no use.
 It's the same as last time!
 Even the captains could barely stop it!
 It's the same as him...  No, this magic's even stronger!
 Don't tell me he's planning to self-destruct!
 My threads are being erased...  It's growing even bigger!
 I can't get any closer like this!
 Guys, we're not going to be  doing anything different!
 We'll just kick his ass again!
 No, no, no, that's not—
 What the heck am I saying?
 I almost gave up again!
 We've come this far! I'm not  giving up until the end!
 Well said, Finral!
 If you figure this out,  I'll go on a date with you.
 Seriously?! I'll do it!
 There must be something we can still do!
 I won't forgive anyone who gets  in the way of my seeing Marie!
 I'm going to defeat him and eat seafood  I haven't even discovered yet!
 I'm scared, but I'll do my best!
 All right! Bring it on!
 Right, consider it brought.
 Hey, you dumbasses. You good?
 Captain Yami!
 Yami! You finally came!
 B-But I thought you were trapped...
 As you can see, I broke through  the spatial magic and got out.
 Though I might've been a bit forceful about it.
 F-Forceful?
 Couldn't you have done that a bit sooner?
 Shut it! I have my reasons!
 If I'm not wanted here, I can go home, you know.
 What?!
 He's sulking!
 Kiato! Kahono!
 All because I wanted to  play this stupid game...
 Gio... I'm sorry to drag you into  this old fool's mess, too.
 B-But to think this man  could use magic like that...
 He's truly a monster.
 I was right not to let him participate in the game.
 Looks like we don't have much time, so let's get this over with.
 All right! Now that Captain Yami's here,
 we've basically got a whole  cavalry... no, a whole army!
 Let's beat the snot outta that guy!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...
 What? Who do you think you're talking to?
 Did your head swell because you  thought you took the enemy down?
 Ow, ow, ow... What do you mean?!
 I'm saying that I can take him on my own.
 You guys risked your lives fighting him.
 I'm the captain, so I've gotta go all-out.
 Finral...
 Vanessa...
 Noelle...
 Gauche...
 Charmy...
 La!
 Who are you again?
 I'm Grey!
 And Magna and Luck...
 You guys did good.
 Yami complimented me!
 I'll be nice and take care of the cleanup.
 Or rather, I'm taking all the glory.
 Seriously... You guys did well.
 The reason I was able to surpass my limits...
 is because of all of you, you dumbasses!
 Getting trapped and pushed  against a wall was worth it.
 This spell reminds me a bit of a certain stretched-out weirdo,
 and that bothers me, but still...
 It's no use...
 You humans shall taste despair... Despair!
 Shut up with the despair this, despair that already, you three-eyed goon!
 It doesn't matter how strong your magic is!
 This spell cuts through dimensions!

 Why can't I sleep?
 On such a bad day, whispering  ""Bye Bye Black Birds""
 Won't make my anxiety go away
 for hours, lately
 I've been crying for hours Baby
 I wish you were here
 All those letters that you gave to me
 Every time I read them again, the pain's gone
 We're not alone, cause we're perfect as four
 Even though we're far apart,  we're connected, believing you
 I always feel you next to me
 closer to me and a ""clover"" for you
 I wish you the best of luck

 Captain of the Black Bulls
 The Professional The Way of the Toilet
 The Professional The Way of the Toilet
 Yami Sukehiro.
 As the captain who leads  the rest of the Black Bulls,
 he does most of his thinking on the toilet.
 Our investigative team  asked him one question.
 Why the toilet...?
 Why else? It's because the toilet is there.
 But let me just say one thing.
 Before going in, you need to  make sure there's toilet paper.
 Those who enter a bathroom  without toilet paper
 are like birds who've had  their wings torn off.
 They'll never be able to  fly out to the blue sky
 that lies beyond the bathroom ever again.
 By the way, the one in charge of the toilet paper here is the brat, but he always forgets.
 I've seen hell many times because of him,  but I showed him an even worse hell.
 Captain Yami! I'm going to fall!
 After that, his remarks about the  toilet continued for hours.
 But there was one thing we wanted to ask  him before we finished this interview.
 How long are you going to stay on the toilet...?
 Hey! Hey! Captain Yami!
 How long are you going to stay in there?!
 Shut up! I can't come out because  you didn't restock the toilet paper!
 Let me out of here, damn it!
 Damn it... I can't just fool around  after you guys worked so hard.

 Thank you! Thank you!
 Please allow me, as the high priest, to grant your wish!
 Sure. So just as we promised,
 we'll be taking the magic stone that  you have here at the Underwater Temple.
 Come on, hand it over.
 What's the magic stone?
 Huh?
 Hey, Gramps, I thought you  knew about the magic stone.
 You guys are after the  magic stone, aren't you?
 If you want it, why don't  we play a little game?
 That's what you said, remember?
 Uh... I just heard you guys talking  about how you were looking

 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 It's been so long!
 I haven't felt this pain  since Saussy Village!
 Hey, Nero. I wondered  where you'd gone off to.
 I guess you were looking  for the magic stone for us!
 Good job!
 Ah, so that's the magic stone...
 If that's all you want,  sure, go ahead and take it.
 No need to hold back.
 Why would we hold back?
 All right, we'll be taking it.
 This concludes our mission.
 All of you...
 Well done.
 Yes, sir!
 The moment I relaxed, all my strength just...
 Asta!
 I'm all out of magic, too.
 Me, too.
 Same.
 Me, too.
 I'm starving...
 Oh, this won't do!
 Let's tend to your wounds and help you recover your magic and stamina.
 To think that Vetto was actually defeated.
 I won't forgive them. I will never  forgive those who make Licht sad.
 We must take back the magic stone...
 so that we can fulfill our dream as the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Damn it. I can't believe we have to  wait for Finral's magic to recover
 before we can go back to the surface.
 You're so friggin' useless.
 Again, I have seniority.
 So, Grey... It turns out  you're a super cute girl.
 I-I'm so embarrassed!  Please don't look at me!
 If your eyes get any pervier,  I'm going to sew them shut, Pervy Finral.
 What?!
 And Grey, if you're that embarrassed, you're never going to make it in the world.
 And you should be a little  more humble, you witch floozy!
 Oh? Are you embarrassed, virgin delinquent?
 Who you callin' a delinquent?!
 I can't wait to fight again.
 I'm so hungry, I can't even move.
 Why the hell is it that you're just hungry?!
 I wonder if that's yummy...
 What really matters here
 is that we got our asses kicked, so I didn't  get to look cool at all, damn it!
 Nothing we can do about that.  This was the full extent of our abilities.
 La? Is there a banquet?
 Thank you, Black Bulls!
 You guys were amazing!
 You're the saviors of the Underwater Temple!
 You guys were so cool!
 We, the absolute worst  Magic Knights squad in history,
 are being thanked by people.
 Yeah, isn't it great? I wanna get even stronger!
 Then I'll get even stronger than you!
 I want to see Marie more.
 I wish I wasn't so easily embarrassed.
 That girl's hot! That one's great, too!
 Sounds like you're all better.
 Being thanked by others is pretty nice.
 I'm so sorry, Kahono.
 You're my friend, but I  couldn't protect your voice.
 I'm so sorry.
 What are you talking about, Noelle?
 Thank you for protecting my home.
 Huh?
 Your magic was amazing!
 It's because you helped  me with my training.
 Yeah, I know. You'd better be grateful.
 Also!
 I haven't given up on my dream.
 So that I can go sing up on the surface again...
 I'll make sure this heals.
 So when I'm an idol someday, you'd better come and hear me sing,
 Noelle.
 Kahono...
 Yeah! I'll definitely go, so you'd better  save me the best seat in the house!
 Promise!
 I promise.
 Oh, you should probably get  some rest. I'll come by again.
 Sure. Thanks for coming to see us.
 Okay, see you later.
 You were awake, Kiato? What's wrong?
 You look goofier than usual.
 Such beautiful tears...  And such a beautiful smile...
 That must be the sea goddess  everyone was talking about.
 I'm in love!
 Okay... I'm going to get my leg healed up fast!
 I have to dance the courtship dance for her!
 You have to introduce me to her later!
 Help me win her over, will ya?
 All right! I'm starting to feel better!
 I'm pretty sure Noelle's unavailable, though.
 Wh-Whoa!
 We ended up getting the magic stone,  but so much happened that we didn't expect.
 Hey! Where are you going?
 Wait up! Stop wandering off like that!
 Jeez... Don't blame me if you get lost.
 What?
 What's up, kid?
 Wow, you're amazing, Captain Yami!
 You must've sensed my ki.
 I asked you what's up, didn't I?
 Answer my question or I'll send you flying.
 What?!
 W-Well... Since we're leaving this place  tomorrow, I wanted go exploring a bit.
 So I was wandering here and there.
 Just full of energy, aren't you?
 So did you find anything?
 Yep! I found fossilized seashells, almost got swallowed by a giant sea anemone,
 and got attacked by this insane  swarm of wharf roaches!
 Gross!
 And then...
 I happened to find these pretty flowers.
 I can't forgive these guys.
 I don't know what it is,
 but these guys must've had something  they can't forgive, either.
 Something that makes them  hate humans so much.
 Dreams? Bonds?
 People like you have no right  to talk about such things!
 Now you've done it, human!
 Don't think that you have hope just  because you've banded together, humans!
 There is no way that I would  lose... against you humans!
 I thought that maybe he was feeling  more despair than anyone else.
 You're an idiot, aren't you?
 Huh?
 I asked if you were an idiot. Answer the question or I'll send you flying.
 Huh?! Yes! I'm an idiot!
 Idiots don't need to think so hard  about stuff like that, you idiot.
 You just need to keep chasing your dream.
 My dream?
 At least for now.
 I can't see! And I can't push it back up!
 Captain Yami! Both of my arms are broken!
 Hello? Captain Yami?
 Huh?
 Captain Yami!
 For now, I just need to  keep chasing my dream, huh?
 My dream, no, our dream is...
 Yuno! Look, look!
 I got my own grimoire!
 It's insanely shabby, but I'm gonna take  good care of it for the rest of my life!
 There, there, there, there, there.  There, there, there, there.
 I'll repay you for this someday.
 Asta...
 Do you remember our promise?
 So you're gonna become the Wizard King, too?
 That means...
 Yuno, you're...
 Asta, you're...
 ...my rival!
 You mean you remember it?
 I thought you were just making fun of me.
 I have no interest in being  too friendly with my rival.
 But you're the one who gave me hope.
 Even if you're poor, an orphan...
 or even us...
 We can become greater than anyone  else in this world. And to prove that...
 To make Sister and everyone else happy...
 Let's see who can become the Wizard King!
 Not yet.
 Not yet, not even close. I still lack the strength.
 Yuno's still ahead of me!
 The captain's right!
 I just need to chase my dream right now!
 I'm gonna hurry up and get my arms  all healed, get even stronger,
 and I'm definitely gonna  become the Wizard King!
 Thank you!
 You really were amazing!
 Thanks!
 Munchy, munchy, nom...
 How long are you guys gonna thank us?!
 They sure have a lot of energy.
 Too much energy.
 What's wrong with that?
 It's nice and merry.
 And there are so many cute girls!
 Yum...
 Eat as much as you'd like!
 Well, see ya.
 Thanks for everything.
 Come back soon. We'll welcome you with open arms.
 Come back, damn it! Capisce?
 I didn't get to look cool at all...
 Even though I'm the strongest  at the Underwater Temple...
 Charmy, how are the Eye of the  Midnight Sun guys you caught doing?
 They're yelling something.
 They won't be able to escape,  so we should be fine.
 Hey, isn't that a ridiculously  powerful binding spell?
 Is it?
 Kiato! Kahono!
 Don't give up on your dreams!
 I'm sure there's magic that  can heal your leg and throat!
 I'll do my best to fix both of my arms, too.
 I'll be dancing on this  leg again in no time!
 Asta, thank you.
 I won't give up, no matter what!
 Okay. Let's go.
 Got it!
 Good grief. I can finally go see Marie.
 Th-Thank you for everything!
 See you!
 Bye-bye!
 See ya!
 Thanks for the yummy meals!
 See ya!
 Come visit sometime!
 Thank you!
 4 AM in the morning
 Why can't I sleep?
 On such a bad day, whispering  ""Bye Bye Black Birds""
 Won't make my anxiety go away
 for hours, lately
 I've been crying for hours Baby
 I wish you were here
 All those letters that you gave to me
 Every time I read them again, the pain's gone
 We're not alone, cause we're perfect as four
 Even though we're far apart,  we're connected, believing you
 I always feel you next to me
 closer to me and a ""clover"" for you
 I wish you the best of luck
 You know you're not alone,  cause we're perfect as four
 Even though we're far apart,  we're connected, you live in me
 I'll always be by your side
 closer to me and a ""clover"" for you
 I wish you the best of luck
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Bah-ha Forever!
 Bah-ha Forever!
 So I worked really hard saving all  the Magic Knights on Raquey Beach.
 Surprisingly true
 Bah-ha!
 I even got a star from the Wizard King!
 I just don't know what to do with myself.
 Amazingly, also true
 I'm not even that amazing.
 This, of course, is also true
 Captain Jack was moved to tears!
 This is a lie
 Bah-ha!
 I think I may be a bit drunk...
 on myself!
 You better not let your guard down  just because one mission's over!
 The next one's coming right up!
 What?! I have to stay behind at the base?!

51,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 We're being led far away
 Until we shatter the road  between light and darkness
 Yo Guess who's back
 Everybody get down
 Guess who's back
 Hey step up step up!
 Proof of Rightness
 I'm falling down because of a twist of fate
 The harmony we had is in the past
 Still left behind
 The scent of you is stuck in my head
 Can't shake it
 Waiting just isn't enough anymore, Yai yah!
 Hey Guess Who is back!?
 As I hold on to my wish
 Hey Guess Who is back!?
 The roulette points to tomorrow
 Hey Guess Who is back!?
 Let the light shine
 Hey Guess Who is back!?
 In the dark maze
 Hey Guess Who is back!?
 Hey Guess Who is back!?
 Until we seize the hope in front of us
 To tell you the truth,  when we were interrogating
 the two Eye of the Midnight Sun members,
 they told us one more thing.
 Asta, do you remember the stone  tablet back at their hideout
 when you were taken by them?
 That thing...
 They call the stones that were  set into it ""magic stones.""
 They believe that if they  collect all of them,
 they will be reborn into their true forms,
 which are linked closely to mana,  and gain enormous power.
 There are three magic stones left.
 They know the location of one of them.
 Yeah? And where's that?
 In a strong magic region...
 The Underwater Temple.
 So you want us to get there before  the Eye of the Midnight Sun does
 and snatch the magic stone or whatever?
 That's right.
 This is an important mission.  The best squad for the job
 is the one with lots of members who aren't  restricted by familial or social status...
 Which means your Black Bulls, Yami.
 Will you do it?
 I dealt with you in the end.
 Hopefully, you can pass on now.
 Thank you from the bottom of my heart  for saving our Underwater Temple!
 Thank you! Thank you!
 All right, we'll be taking it.
 This concludes our mission.
 All of you...
 Well done.
 The Black Bulls were given a  special mission by the Wizard King
 in which they fought hard against a  terrifying enemy, obtained a magic stone,
 and finally returned safely,  without losing a single member.
 Great job, everyone!
 You're the most beat-up of all of us.
 I'm so tired...
 Ah, Marie... I'm finally  back on land where you are.
 I'm breathing the same air as Marie now...
 It's munchy time!
 My tummy always has room for fish and meat!
 Nothing beats a drink, or a full  bottle, after a hard day's work!
 The glory goes to all of  us Black Bulls, doesn't it?
 We'll get a little closer  to positive stars again.
 Maybe we're not a lost cause after all!
 I say we might be getting closer,
 but we're clearly still below  every other Magic Knight squad.
 Hey, look.
 Oh, yeah. I forgot he wasn't with us.
 Gordon... I totally forgot about him.
 Welcome back. I was so lonely...
 Hey, someone go talk to him.
 You guys are so mean.
 Is he sad?
 I can't believe you left me behind.
 Nah, I think he's pissed.  He's, like, mumbling something.
 I wanted to go, too.
 I was looking forward to going so much.
 Isn't he always mumbling?
 No idea... I have no idea what he's thinking.
 I even bought sunscreen and a parasol.
 And you left me behind...
 I wanted to help at the Underwater Temple.
 I wanted to fight alongside everyone else...
 Gordon Agrippa.
 He's a loner who just wants friends,  but he can't seem to make any.
 No one even brought any gifts...
 Tell me what happened at the Underwater Temple.
 I want to know what you all did.
 I want to record everything...
 Well, I'm not looking forward to this,  but I'm gonna go report to the Wizard King.
 Charmy, you're coming  with me. Bring the prisoners.
 Will there be yummy food?!
 Nope.
 Finral, transport us there.
 Will there be pretty girls?!
 Nope.
 D'oh.
 Marie's an angel!
 I-I wanna go, too! Please, sir, please!
 You sure are full of energy.
 Hey, you need to get plenty  of rest so you can heal up.
 N-Not that I'm worried about you!  Don't get the wrong idea!
 What's the big idea, Noelle?!
 You are pretty hurt. Just stay put, kid.
 Or so I'd like to say,
 but I guess you were with me when the  Wizard King gave us this mission.
 Fine, come with.
 Yes, sir!
 Everyone else, make sure you get some rest...
 Yeah, guess I don't need to tell you that.
 Take care.
 You coming, too, Nero?
 Come to think of it...
 Didn't that thing you found at Saussy Village  sorta look like a magic stone?
 Asta!
 Coming!
 We're going! Hurry it up.
 Quit wastin' time!
 Sorry!
 Man, this place is as stupidly huge as ever!
 Shut up.
 Good work, Finral.
 Huh?
 You can go play until we come back.
 What?! No fair!
 I wanna meet the Wizard King, too!
 I really am nothing but your ride now!
 But then again, it'd be more fun to go
 flirt with girls in the capital  than to see the Wizard King.
 See ya, guys!
 Wait for me, cuties!
 I see.
 He was a member of the  Third Eye, the strongest of
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun, then?
 His name was Vetto the Despair.
 Despair, eh?
 We'll send his corpse in for an autopsy
 I can't move! Let us go!
 and interrogate the other  Eye of the Midnight Sun members.
 Let us out!
 Got it.
 Your binding spell is fantastic.
 That fluff is superb.
 Who are you?
 By the way, Yami, is this  little one your child?
 When did you end up with a kid this big?
 She's not.
 Gimme something yummy.
 But anyway...
 La!
 Safe!
 Here's the magic stone.
 Well done, indeed.
 I'm sure you've heard, but many lost  their lives fighting at Raquey.
 This should help them rest in peace.
 The Black Bulls accomplished  this very important mission
 without losing a single member.
 Absolutely brilliant.
 It seems that you've also grown stronger,
 Yami.
 I heard he made that  foreigner a Magic Knight.
 What's Captain Julius thinking?
 You're going to make someone like  that a Magic Knights Squad Captain?!
 Are you insane, Wizard King?
 Aren't you a little too  happy-go-lucky, mister?
 You've truly become a magnificent  Magic Knights Captain, Yami.
 Cut it out. I'm 28 now, you know?  You're embarrassing me.
 Oh, sorry about that.
 ""If you want to say you're right,
 then prove it with the results you  get from doing things your way.""
 That's what you told me, Julius.
 I've said this before, but all I did
 was prove that you were right.
 And these guys, my Magic Knights...
 Ow!
 ...proved that I was right.
 Yeah...
 Asta, you've earned another achievement.
 You're another step closer  to becoming the Wizard King.
 I look forward to seeing what you do next.
 Yes, sir!
 U-Um, Wizard King, sir, I have a r-request.
 What is it?
 U-Um, well...
 C-Could I have your autograph?!
 Sure, I'll write it right on your face.
 Please, no!
 You jerk. Get nervous around me, too!
 I do! I do!
 I'm sorry to interrupt, Wizard King.
 Mushroom Head.
 Who are you calling ""Mushroom Head""?!
 No, now's not the time for that!
 What's the matter, Marx?
 The border town of Kiten, which has a history  of skirmishes with the Diamond Kingdom,
 is under attack by a  Diamond Kingdom squad.
 They couldn't have chosen a worse time.
 This is...
 Wh-What's with that massive horde of people?!
 This looks like a bit more  than their usual harassment.
 Not to mention the ones leading this army...
 Yes, sir. We believe they're Lagus,
 Brocks,
 and Yagos.
 Three of the Eight Shining Generals.
 What are the Eight Shining Generals?
 The eight strongest from the Diamond Kingdom.
 What?!
 They're similar to the Magic Knights  Captains of the Clover Kingdom.
 That's super bad news!
 Clover Kingdom
 Kiten
 Diamond Kingdom
 This isn't good. Kiten is the  cornerstone of our border defense.
 It'll be easier for the Diamond Kingdom to invade if they take it.
 The time has come.
 The Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals Lagus
 The history of the Diamond Kingdom  will finally move forward.
 The Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals Yagos
 It's been so long since my last battle! I can barely contain myself!
 The Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals Brocks
 Those Clover Kingdom weaklings!  I'll crush them all!
 It appears that our intel about their  border defense being weakened due to
 their struggles with a terrorist group
 called the Eye of the Midnight Sun was correct.
 If we can conquer Kiten, it'll immediately  give our forces the advantage!
 I can't wait!
 Besides, that location is  packed with resources.
 They're wasted on the likes of the Clovers.
 The Diamond Kingdom is attacking!
 In the name of the Magic Knights,  do not allow them to invade!
 Yeah!
 Activate the magical barrier!
 That's a magical barrier built with  the power of fifty Magic Knights!
 They won't be able to  break through that easily!
 And this barrier doesn't allow  attacks from the outside in,
 but will let spells from the inside out.
 First, we'll attack that  lightning magic user,
 one of the Eight Shining Generals, Lagus!
 Concentrate all your attacks on him!
 Such pathetic and ugly magic.
 Watch carefully. This is how you use magic.
 Lightning Creation Magic: Thunderbird  Warrior Air-Splitting Magic Bow!
 All right! Now we charge!
 Don't break formation.
 Stay in squads of ten.
 Defense mages, activate barrier spells  and watch out for long-range magic.
 Yes, sir!
 Close-range and mid-range attack mages,
 scout for enemies and let  your magic charge up.
 Yes, sir!
 Long-range attack mages,
 keep up a barrage of spells with low magic  consumption to throw them into confusion!
 Yes, sir!
 And then—
 Go!
 Red Clay Creation Magic:  Raging Great Boar Charge!
 Long live the Diamond Kingdom!
 Curse that Brocks! I was still talking!
 What kind of general charges in personally?
 Also, you should be flying.
 Oh, well. This is nothing new.
 There was very little beauty in it,
 but he was trying to use that  attack to make them cower in fear.
 Yagos, we're going after him.
 I-It's no use! They're just too powerful!
 Well, that ain't good.
 The Magic Knights charged  with defending Kiten
 have mostly been wiped out.
 That's—
 What? What is it, Mushroom Head?
 It's them.
 The Clover Kingdom's most powerful Magic Knights Squad.
 The Golden Dawn!
 All right, everyone. Let's ask our  rude guests to take their leave.
 Yuno!
 My meal-saving prince?!
 Weak! Too weak!
 Where are the Magic Knights Captains?! You're all worthless!
 A message for the generals!
 It appears the Clover Kingdom's  reinforcements have arrived!
 The only enemy is the  members of the Golden Dawn!
 I repeat, the only enemy is  the members of the Golden Dawn!
 Idiots! Do they think they can  stop us with just one squad?!
 They're all fools!
 Blocking my way? You've got some guts!
 You fool! I'll blast you to bits!
 Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!
 Who's blasting whom to bits?
 Well, look at you, acting all cool.
 Use my powers, too!
 Listen, the reason you  can't make any friends is
 Wind Spirit Bell
 because you put on airs like that!
 Why don't you try putting on a breezy  smile once in a while, Yuno?
 Breezy? Not happening.
 Hey... What do you mean by ""not happening""?
 I'm one of the Four Great  Nature Spirits! Don't ignore me!
 Say something, dang it!
 ""Something.""
 ""Something""?!
 You'll never be able to make  friends like that, you sourpuss!
 But don't you worry.  I'll be staying with you forever!
 Aren't you lucky?
 Okay, let's hurry up and take care  of those guys and go on a date, Yuno!
 Nope.
 How dare you refuse a date  with me?! Unbelievable!
 Hey!
 Looks like at least one of you has a spine!
 My meal-saving prince!
 So that's the Wind Spirit?  I want to see her in person!
 Looks like you've gotten even stronger, Yuno.
 Damn, Yuno!
 The Golden Dawn rushed to the scene,
 but they're up against three of the  Eight Shining Generals and that many troops.
 I'd like to send reinforcements,
 but the only ones who can  head there immediately are...
 The Crimson Lion Kings went to the  Ioto Mountain Range on another mission.
 The Silver Eagles are tied up  with the Spade Kingdom...
 You want me to go, Julius?
 I'm pretty sure Finral's been there before, so we can go immediately.
 Are you sure, Yami? You just returned  from the Underwater Temple.
 Sure. I'm pretty invincible right now anyway,
 and...
 There's a guy I'm a little concerned about.
 I'd feel better if you were to go.
 I'd like to go, but...
 We need you here, Wizard King.
 If this is a feint, their next  target will be the royal capital.
 What he said. I can't just leave.
 Besides, the king is here.
 All right, then...
 Shit. I should've had Finral  come up here with us.
 That useless bastard.
 I wonder if someone's talking about me.
 Cuties spotted!
 Hey there, you beauties who  put flowers to shame...
 Are you busy?
 Captain Yami!
 Take me with you!
 With your arm like that?
 There must be people who couldn't get  away! I'm sure I can do something!
 I'd like him to get experience on that  kind of battlefield, but right now...
 No.
 Someone who's as beat up as you  will just get in the way. Go home.
 But...
 As his senior, I'll go along and protect him.
 Miz Charmy...
 That makes it all right, doesn't it?
 You two! Especially you, Charmy...
 Oh, fine. Come with me, you dumbasses!
 Let's go get Finral!
 Roger that, sir!
 La, sir!
 Now I can see my meal-saving prince!
 Just you wait, Yuno!
 Wow, that's amazing. It's in pieces.
 He'll get even stronger.
 I guess I wouldn't expect any  less from our genius, Yuno,
 who became one of our best knights  less than a year after joining.
 Well, shall we, Langris?
 Yes, sir.
 Let's make them regret barging into  our country with their muddy boots.

 Promise!
 It's been a while, Yuno!  Looks like you've gotten even stronger!
 Of course. I'm going to  become stronger than anyone.
 Do you remember our promise? About seeing  who can become the Wizard King first?
 Promise? I've forgotten about the past.
 Why are you trying to act so cool?
 So, uh, what're you doing tomorrow? You got work?
 Tomorrow? Who knows what tomorrow brings?
 Seriously, why are you trying  to act so cool, Yuno?!
 Yuno? Is that my name?
 I don't know anything!  This can't be happening!
 So you weren't just trying to  act cool?! Get a grip, Yuno!

 The Golden Dawn is on the job?  Then let's just leave it to them!

 Man, you girls sure are cute!
 I know a meadow where there are  flowers as beautiful as you two.
 Say, why don't we take a little  trip there with my spatial magic?
 What's the matter? You look like you  just saw something really scary.
 They're going to murder us!
 Hey! What's the big idea?!
 Relax, la.
 Shut up! Hurry up and get  us to the town called Kiten!
 Huh? But I thought we were off today...
 You don't get any time off.
 You can have all the time off  you want once you're dead.
 What?!
 Let's do this, Finral!
 Hurry up with the portal  already, you bastard.
 C'mon, let's see how far you can jump.
 Are you mugging me now?!
 We're counting on you, Finral!
 Why are you so raring to go?!
 My meal-saving prince!
 What are you even talking about?
 Let's go!
 Huh, what?
 Hurry it up!
 Okay, fine! Here we go!
 It's the Golden Dawn!
 So you're the advance guard  for the Golden Dawn?
 Not bad for a little brat!
 Goodness.
 Such a wretched form for a Shining General.
 How unsightly.
 Lagus!
 I can't bear to watch. I'll lend you a hand.
 No one asked for your help!
 He's mine!
 It appears that the people  have great faith in him.
 Lagus! Listen to me when I'm talking to you!
 In that case, let's see if you can protect  yourself as well as your people!
 Arrows... Bell.
 Yup! Leave it to me!
 Wind Magic: Swift White Bow.
 What?!
 Impossible!
 He easily deflected my fastest  lightning-coated arrows
 and even broke through my barrier?
 ""See if you can actually protect them""?
 That's my line.
 Wh-Who are you?
 Let's see if you can protect  yourself and your comrades.
 Yeah! Yeah!
 Yuno and I are one, right?
 Hey, why are you ignoring me? At least say something!
 ""Something.""
 Really?! Quit messing with me, you smart-ass!
 Want my help now, Lagus?
 How dare he make me look like a fool?
 He's mine! Stay out of my way, Brocks!
 He's mine! You stay out of my way!
 He's mine!
 Mine!
 Mine!
 Mine!
 What are you talking about?!
 Yuno's mine!
 Not a chance.
 Good grief.
 The kid I encountered in the  dungeon has gotten a lot stronger.
 Man, it's not fair how fast kids grow.
 Way to make an old man feel older.
 My girls are growing up fast, too.
 When they were younger,
 they always said they wanted  to marry me when they grew up.
 But now they won't even take baths with me.
 And they don't want my underwear washed with their clothes...
 A-Adjutant General Lotus?
 And they say my breath smells like onions...
 Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!
 There's no end to them!
 All these people...
 They're all so weak!
 His magic keeps clinging to us, making our spells not work properly!
 There.
 Slime Creation Magic: Mucusnail!
 This spell drastically weakens  the magic of anyone it catches.
 You'll never be able to get out of there.
 I just love watching powerless  weaklings writhe in agony.
 Wow, that looks like a tough spell to deal with.
 Though, I mean, it's pretty  useless against me.
 What was that spell?
 Spatial magic?
 Yikes... The one thing about this spell is that it sort of destroys anything.
 Oh, well. I guess someone will  just have to rebuild it.
 Let's see... That guy's definitely  the leader of the Golden Dawn.
 I wonder why he's just  standing there. How creepy.
 He's got his grimoire open, so I  think he's using magic, but...
 All I see is what looks  like tree roots spreading.
 A spell to grow a huge tree?
 That sounds nice and peaceful.
 But there's no one who could summon a spell  big enough to protect this whole city.
 He's using other people's magic?
 Why do I always notice stuff like this?
 Calling the three generals!  This is Adjutant General Lotus.
 The enemy general, the captain of the Golden Dawn,
 Mine!
 seems to be activating a  large-scale magic attack.
 Mine!
 Mine!
 Mine!
 At the very least, the range will include all of Kiten.
 Mine!
 I repeat! The captain of the Golden Dawn  is activating a large-scale magic attack.
 And they're definitely not listening.
 What should I do? Run?
 The time is at hand.
 The great tree shall now bloom!
 What the heck is this insane magic?
 World Tree Magic: Great Mistilteinn Tree.
 All for the Clover Kingdom's prosperity.
 So this is Kiten.
 Wait, whoa! What the heck is this giant tree?!
 Trees like that grow around here?
 Do you think there's giant fruit up there?!
 Okay, that's enough out of you idiots.
 This is probably Captain Shiny's spell.
 Wait, what?! This is a spell?
 Maybe they didn't need us after all.
 Really? Let's go back, then! Please?
 Nah. I'm gonna go check and  see how the battle's going.
 I'm assuming Captain Shiny's up top.
 I'm gonna head up there. You three help  the townspeople, and try not to die.
 Leave it to us!
 Hey! Y-Yami!
 First, I'm gonna get me  a piece of that fruit.
 Asta's hurt, and Charmy's... drooling.
 Yeah... I'm nervous.
 Good grief.
 Apparently, there was an incredible  amount of magic on that battlefield.
 I suspect this cleaned up most of it, though.
 We've suffered a huge loss! Our army's basically wiped out!
 Our army... has basically been wiped out?
 Curse you!
 You know what they say  about people who get greedy.
 How unsightly.
 My arms might be useless, but I've still got my legs!
 Everyone! Please come this way to escape!
 Please get on this, la.
 Are you hurt? Please, come this way.
 Thank you.
 It is our duty as Magic Knights to  save the citizens of the kingdom.
 If you're not busy,
 why don't we... get some tea later?
 Whoops. If I look down, my tears will...
 La?
 Someone's going head-to-head with  one of the Diamond guys in the sky.
 Yuno!
 My meal-saving prince!
 Go! Go! My lovely prince!
 You can do it, you can  do it, my lovely prince!
 La!
 This young man is so strong...
 Inconceivable! I'm one of  the Eight Shining Generals!
 You shall fall before my beautiful magic!
 Beautiful?
 Beauty doesn't matter in battle.
 Whoever's strongest wins. That's all there is to it.
 So beautiful...
 He defeated him with a single blow!
 Such a refreshing breeze...
 I thought I saw a familiar little speck.
 What are you doing here, Asta?
 That guy joined the Magic Knights  the same time Asta did.
 Not to mention you're all torn up,  scrambling around, and soaked with sweat...
 Talk about ugly.
 He worked his way up into  the Golden Dawn's elite?
 Of course he'd make fun of the Black Bulls. All that and he's handsome, too.
 He's probably super popular.
 The fact that you're so beat up means...
 You got stronger again, didn't you?
 Huh?
 I'm not losing to you, Asta.
 Yuno's... smiling?
 La...
 I-I could eat a hundred bowls  of rice along with that smile.
 Look who's talking! You got  crazy strong, too, you jerk!
 I'm not gonna lose either, Yuno!
 He's an elite in the Golden Dawn,
 has super powerful magic,  and is super handsome...
 Yet he's competing with Asta,
 a member of the Black Bulls,  who's a meathead with zero magic!
 They must be great rivals.
 Are you all right, Yuno?
 Are you hurt at all?
 Asta!
 Asta!
 What happened to your arms?!
 Are they gravely hurt?! Are you all right?!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Not that I was worried or anything.
 You got hurt because you let your guard down!
 Pay more attention!
 R-Right...
 I'll heal you immediately  with my recovery magic.
 I'm fine. Go ahead and  heal all the citizens.
 Oh, my goodness! I shouldn't  have been so forward!
 I'm so sorry!
 That's right! We don't have  time to deal with you!
 Let's go, Mimosa.
 Right.
 Yuno, you stay near Asta.
 I'm sure you can't fight  with your arms like that.
 But I'm not trying to spoil you or anything!
 You can go now.
 Please take care, Asta!
 Bye-bye! Ow...
 I finally found you.
 You must be the captain of the Golden Dawn.
 I had completely underestimated you. Who knew you'd have such tremendous magic?
 You've got impressive magic yourself.
 There's no reason to perish in vain.
 Take your comrades and leave this land.
 What?
 Diamond soldiers never retreat!
 Red Clay Magic:  Brilliant Armor Heavy Artillery!
 What's that weak little spell supposed to do?
 Let me guess... You must  be out of magic already.
 Victory is mine!
 World Tree Magic: Mistilteinn Seed.
 You should be honored.
 Your magic has nourished the Clover Kingdom.
 A Diamond ambush? He must've been  hiding with his magic concealed.
 Yami!
 'Scuse me... Shiny Oddball Masked Dude.
 Ouch.
 I thought that if I could manage
 to bag the Golden Captain, I could turn things around, but...
 To think the guy I fought  back then would show up.
 And he's even stronger now to boot.
 Please stop leaving this  old guy so far behind.
 Looks like you owe me one, Vangeance.
 You saved me, Yami.
 Ki, was it? How astounding.
 Hey, old Diamond dude that I don't know.
 Wanna surrender?
 Wait, really? You don't remember me?
 Look. Right here.
 I've got no interest in  your filthy-looking chest.
 Don't make me cut you down.
 D'oh...
 So, what's it gonna be?
 This is definitely bad news...
 But now's the time to show you guys  what a true Diamond looks like, and...
 Retreat!
 Didn't hesitate one bit. I like that.
 Well, then...
 Now that we're alone in a  spot with such a great view,
 why don't we have a little chat, Vangeance?
 Man, your world tree magic  is as impressive as ever.
 Please. It's possible thanks  to the enemies' magic.
 Right... Your magic is world tree magic.
 It is.
 Exactly what are you trying to say, Yami?
 I'm someone who believes his gut instincts.
 Vangeance...
 Could you take off that mask?

 Amazing!
 So there aren't seven transformations?
 Did you see, Asta, how unbelievably  strong I've become?
 I'm never going to lose to you...  not in strength, looks, or height!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 As a plan to get a strategic upper  hand against the Clover Kingdom,
 the Diamond Kingdom attacked  the border town of Kiten.
 But the Golden Dawn arrived  there before anyone else
 and faced off with the Diamond army,
 quelling the situation.
 Wind Magic: Swift White Bow.
 I thought I saw a familiar little speck.
 What are you doing here, Asta?
 The fact that you're so beat up means...
 You got stronger again, didn't you?
 Huh?
 I'm not losing to you, Asta.
 Look who's talking! You got  crazy strong, too, you jerk!
 I'm not gonna lose either, Yuno!
 Behind the Mask
 Your arm... Is it okay?
 Yeah, I'm fine!
 See? No problem at all!
 I see. It looks like you're  as reckless as ever.
 Y-Yuno's actually smiling?
 I think you got a little taller  since I last saw you, Yuno.
 What the heck? He always acts  apathetic when he's with me!
 Oh, yeah. I might've grown  four or five centimeters.
 How do you keep getting taller so easily?!
 Damn it! I'm not gonna lose!
 I'm gonna get 20 centimeters taller  by tomorrow and look down on you!
 Not a chance.
 What are you doing, Yuno?!
 Yuno, who the heck is this twerp?!
 You're acting all apathetic again!
 What the heck is that fussy,  mysterious little critter?
 Is that the Sylph I've heard so much about?
 I've never seen Yuno make that face!  Is this the power of the Sylph?!
 Tell me! Who is this mummified shrimp?!
 Hey, you're small, too!
 He's a guy I used to live with.
 Y-Y-Y-You...
 Y-You lived with him?
 We would eat together, study together...
 ...sleep in the same bed together,  and even bathe together.
 Slept in the same bed... and even bathed...?
 Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky, sneaky...
 U-Um...
 It's been a while!
 Um, thank you so much for  saving my meal last time.
 All you all better now?
 Oh, you're the girl from back then... From the Black Bulls.
 Please enjoy this after-battle snack!
 Thanks.
 I'll even thrown in some extra dragees.
 Thanks.
 Now who's this insolent child? She's clearly head over heels for Yuno.
 I'm Charmy. May I call you ""Yuno""?
 Sure.
 La!
 This is good.
 La, la!
 But my Sylph senses are telling me that  she doesn't actually pose a threat.
 I'm sorry for pushing you  down so suddenly back then.
 La...
 Oh, don't worry about that! It's just  something that did indeed happen!
 P-Push... P-Pushed down?!
 La?!
 Why, you... You must've used some  sneaky spell to seduce Yuno!
 You snot-nosed little brat!
 La? What's this creature?
 Are you yummy?
 Miz Charmy! She's a spirit!
 Don't eat her!
 What's with you people?!
 Yuno belongs to me, dang it!
 ""Snot-nosed little brat""?  I can't let that slide.
 I'm nineteen!
 I'm older than Yuno and  rather sophisticated, too!
 My sexiness doesn't need  any magical enhancement!
 Sexy?! You're built like a grade-schooler,  besides your giant forehead!
 La?! Oh, you did not just go there!
 You're also built like a grade-schooler  and have a giant forehead!
 What did you say?! I'll show you  what happens when you cross a Sylph!
 You insolent little brat!
 I'll fry you up and eat you!
 La!
 Come back here, you little insect!
 Calm down, Miz Charmy!
 Bell, that's enough.
 Hup.
 Hey, looks like you're having fun.
 Let me join in.
 Finral.
 Who's that?
 This is my senior from  the Black Bulls, Finral.
 You guys haven't met before?
 Nope.
 It's fine. Not like I'd catch the  eye of an elite from the Golden—
 What's this?
 Well, well... If it isn't my big brother.
 It's been so long! I never  dreamed I'd run into you here.
 Langris...
 Who's that?
 What's the black sheep of our family,  who can barely even fight,
 even doing on the battlefield?
 Finral, who's that rude little twerp?!
 He's my little brother.
 Huh?
 That's the Vice Captain of the  Golden Dawn, Langris Vaude.
 Golden Dawn Vice Captain Langris Vaude
 What? Vice captain?!
 Are you still acting as the   Black Bulls' pack mule, Finral?
 It looks like I'll have to be the next head
 of the Vaude family,  since you're such a loser.
 Get over yourself!
 Finral's awesome!
 At the Underwater Temple,
 it was only because I had Finral's help  that we were able to defeat the enemy!
 Wow! You mean you were actually  useful for once in your life?
 More importantly, how can you talk to  your big brother like that, you punk?!
 How dare you address the Vice Captain  of the Golden Dawn like that?
 Wh-What did you say?!
 It's okay, Asta. He's only telling the truth.
 But...
 It's fine.
 We've already cleaned up  most of the enemies...
 Or rather, our captain dealt  with most of them himself.
 The Bulls aren't needed here anymore.
 And anyway...
 When did the Black Bulls  become a daycare center?
 Looking after two children must be rough.
 Aren't you embarrassed at having  to babysit those two rugrats?
 Who're you calling a rugrat?!
 I'll show you the charms of a mature woman!
 I'm not a little kid, damn it!
 Langris, you can insult me  to your heart's content.
 Hmph.
 But... don't you dare insult the  members of my Black Bulls!
 Wow. Who knew you could look so scary?
 You little brat...
 On the honor of the Eight Shining Generals,  I'm taking your head back home with me!
 Oh, dear... You're still alive?
 Not only that, but at this rate,
 my spatial magic is going  to hit those civilians.
 You can't lay a finger on me, Magic Knights!
 Save us!
 I don't have time to hesitate.
 Oh, well. They'll just have to be noble  sacrifices for the sake of our country.
 Hold it!
 How can you even think about  abandoning our citizens?!
 We're Magic Knights!
 And if this goes on, we'll just  end up with even more victims!
 Shut up! I'm not gonna abandon anyone!
 Finral! Miz Charmy!
 Right!
 Roger!
 Just you watch, Yuno!
 Let's see what you've got.
 What can you possibly do  in the condition you're in?
 Talk about a lively retreat...
 Cotton Creation Magic: Fluffy Sheep Cushion!
 Who the hell are you?!  Stay out of this, brat!
 Spatial magic?
 Wh-What?! My magic disappeared!
 What did you do, you brat?!
 Looks like I owe you one, Yuno.
 Your fighting style's  as insane as ever, Asta.
 Yuno's smiling again! Hmph!
 Langris...
 You're right. I can't beat you.
 But...
 The Black Bulls will beat the Golden Dawn!
 Yeah!
 Man, your world tree magic  is as impressive as ever.
 Exactly what are you trying to say?
 I'm someone who believes his gut instincts.
 Vangeance...
 Could you take off that mask?
 Vangeance...
 Could you take off that mask?
 This isn't a face that most  people would want to see.
 What? Are you, like, super ugly  under there or something?
 Don't worry. I promise I won't laugh.
 I know what this is, Yami.
 You suspect that I may be the leader of  the Eye of the Midnight Sun, don't you?
 Frankly, yeah.
 His light magic and your world  tree magic are obviously different,
 but something's really bugging me.
 Their builds, their voices, and more  than anything, their ki feels the same.
 But...
 I think it's been about ten  years since I first met you.
 Indeed.
 We met on the battlefield, and after that,  we fought together from time to time.
 Then we became captains at the same time.
 Nozel's braid shook like  crazy when that happened.
 It's not like we're best buds or anything,
 but we go back pretty far, don't we?
 I feel something similar in you...
 So just let me see your face, all right?
 Very well.
 That's one hell of a scar.  Did you get it on the battlefield?
 No, I was born with it.
 They called me a cursed child.
 A cursed child?
 Even magic couldn't fix this scar.
 It creeped out the people around me,  and they came to fear me.
 I was the illegitimate  child of a certain noble.
 I lived in the Forsaken Realm  until I was eight.
 But following the loss of that noble's heir, I was taken in as an aristocrat.
 Fortunately, I had great magical power, and my world tree magic was viewed with awe.
 But even there, they loathed my face.
 In addition, my foster mother  brutally abused me.
 It was a hellish childhood.
 You sure had it rough, didn't you?
 But in the midst of all that, I met Master Julius.
 He didn't care about my appearance. All he saw was my power.
 Little boy, what kind of magic is that?
 I-It's world tree magic, sir.
 World tree magic?! How sublime and majestic!
 That's terrific!
 Most of all... It's as though your  kindness is trying to protect everything.
 What wonderful magic!
 You should definitely join the Magic Knights!
 Do you not want to?
 N-No! I would love to...
 I never even thought about  joining the Magic Knights.
 But my face...
 It's nothing to worry about.
 Huh?
 It really is nothing to worry about,  but if you are so worried about it...
 In that case...
 I'll give you this mask!
 Master Julius, this is so... tacky.
 What?! But it's my best work!
 I was happy.
 I wanted to pledge my  grimoire to his service.
 This story sounds pretty familiar.
 The lines of his face also look like Licht's.
 But I can't sense the slightest  trace of magic from his scar.
 He doesn't seem to be doing anything tricky  with magic or showing me an illusion.
 And more than anything...
 His ki tells me he's not lying.
 I guess this was just some odd coincidence.
 Sorry about that.
 No... I'm glad I was able to tell you  and show you things as they really are.
 Thank you, Yami.
 I see.
 Captain Vangeance! Captain Vangeance!
 The Diamonds have begun to retreat.
 Understood. There's no need to  pursue those who are fleeing.
 Could you concentrate on helping the injured?
 Understood, sir.
 Shall we go, too? There are  plenty of captives.
 It's going to be a pain  transporting them all.
 Yeah.
 Oh, if we're transporting captives, I brought some useful guys along.
 Let's work 'em to the bone.
 Within reason, of course.
 I wonder if a cute girl is talking about me.
 Looks like the fighting has calmed down,  so why don't we meet up with Yami?
 Good idea.
 La?! Already?
 Well, see ya, Yuno.
 Yeah, see you, Asta. Don't eat stuff you find lying on the ground.
 Like I'd do that! I mean, I used to, but...
 Um, c-could I maybe ask for your address?
 Stay away from Yuno, you thieving raccoon!
 La! Scales!
 Your scales are getting in my eyes!
 La! No way!
 I'm gonna fry you up!
 Come back here!
 Get away from me!
 You little insect!
 La?
 La! I'm definitely going  to fry you up next time!
 I know it's too late to take it back now,
 but the worst squad just picked  a fight with the best squad!
 Does your stomach hurt, Finral?
 I wanna hurry up and practice with my sword!
 I wanted to talk with Yuno more!
 I'm going to eat my sorrows away!
 You guys are way too laid-back! I mean, I'm the one who picked the fight, but...
 Now, now. Here, eat this. Nomity noms.
 Hey, it's good.
 Honestly, what a vulgar bunch.
 You should be more careful about  who you associate with, Yuno.
 Aren't you embarrassed to be seen with them?
 Why?
 I've never thought that, not even once.
 I'm proud of Asta, and he's my rival.
 Rival? That guy?
 Rival in what? Are you guys  competing for something?
 Yeah...
 By the way, Asta, was it okay to  just leave so abruptly like that?
 That handsome guy is your  old friend, isn't he?
 It's fine!
 We'll meet on some other battlefield, anyway.
 Because...
 ...we're both working to  become the Wizard King!
 The Wizard King?!
 You really aren't embarrassed  to say that at all, are you?!
 Maybe you peasants don't  even feel embarrassment.
 I'd expect no less from the great peasant  who was chosen by the four-leaf grimoire!
 What's your problem?! I won't  allow you to make fun of Yuno—
 There's no rule that says commoners  can't become the Wizard King.
 Huh?
 So first, I'll become the  Captain of the Golden Dawn.
 I see. Meaning you're completely  ignoring my existence as vice captain.
 Yuno, things are taken care of over here.
 All the wounded are taken care of, too.
 What in the world happened?
 The Diamond forces have retreated, and we've taken a number of captives.
 Kiten was successfully defended.
 Excellent work.
 Please see to the repair  of the damaged buildings
 and set up shelters immediately.
 Yes, sir.
 Now, then... I don't think that was
 a serious attempt by the Diamonds  to invade our kingdom.
 So what were they after?
 I see... The Sylph, eh?
 Offensive spatial magic...
 Oh, and world tree magic  that uses others' magic.
 I guess the rusty old generals of the  previous era had their useful moments,
 but from here on out, this era belongs
 to us Mage Warriors, the new generals!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Together!
 T-Together!
 Is that the Sylph I've heard so much about?
 I've never seen Yuno make that face!
 Is this the power of the Sylph?!
 He's a guy I used to live with.
 What?!
 You can't be serious.
 You guys slept together?!
 Asta, hey. You can't be serious...
 You guys ate together?!
 Go!
 You can't be serious...
 You guys bathed together?!
 What's wrong with her?
 No idea.
 Thank goodness.
 I didn't know what I was  going to do if Vangeance
 was actually Licht from  the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

 the Diamond troops from invading Kiten,
 Yami asked Vangeance something that had  been bothering him for a long time.
 Vangeance...
 Could you take off that mask?
 Yami, you suspect that I may be the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, don't you?

 Sorry about that.
 As Asta and Yuno were reunited during  this battle and renewed their ambitions...
 We're both working to  become the Wizard King!

 Never Again
 Sounds like a lively bunch has arrived.
 Are you just not satisfied unless  you're fighting something? Huh?
 My head! It's going to crack!
 It's going to break!
 Is that what's wrong with you?
 My body is moving on its own?!
 Well, whatever. You fought  despite how broken you are.
 Captain Yami, I can't! Please!
 Spare me, please!
 Have him take a look at you and your head.
 I think my head's being affected  more now than it usually is!
 Hey, Yami. Come on in.
 Who are you?
 This guy, who looks completely  out of place in this tower,
 is the kingdom's best quack doctor. You might've gathered that from how he looks.
 That's so rude!
 He managed to reattach one of my  arms after it almost fell off before,
 so he's a great recovery mage.
 Have him check you out.
 I'm gonna get even more injured!
 Are you all right?
 Recovery Mage Who Works Directly Under the Wizard King Owen
 I'm Owen, a recovery mage who  works directly under the Wizard King.
 Pleasure to meet you.
 I'm Asta! Thanks for seeing me!
 I hear all about you when  I go out drinking with Yami.
 Really?!
 Yeah. I heard that you can nullify magic.
 Who knew such magic existed?
 He works directly under the Wizard King? Even I know what that means!
 He must be an incredible quack doctor!
 Welp, I've got something  I gotta take care of.
 I've got a good feeling that  I'm gonna win today.
 You're going gambling, aren't you?
 May Lady Luck be with you!
 Jeez... Yami's younger than me,  but he's much bolder. It's so irritating.
 He's not a bad guy, though.
 Yup!
 Well, have a seat.
 Yes, sir.
 Now, then... Let's see.
 Water Recovery Magic: Qualle Operation.
 Wow, they got you good, didn't they?
 But don't you worry. My spell sees through  the body of the person it envelops,
 so I can get a clear look at the affected  area and heal it with precision.
 Yami's amazing, but you've got  some amazing muscles yourself.
 I work out!
 Now for some mana to promote healing...
 Man, I finally got out of Kiten.
 Just how many captives  did the Golden Dawn take?
 Let's see, where's Asta...
 Whoa, what the heck is that?!
 Jellyfish... recovery magic?
 Asta...
 Oh, hey, Finral. Sorry to keep you waiting.
 Oh, hey, Asta. No worries.
 Yami should show up any minute now.
 Hey!
 Captain Yami, did you...
 I was on fire today!
 What's with the huge bag?
 Huh? Forget it. Let's just go home.
 Hurry up with the spatial magic, Finral.
 Okay...
 All right, listen up.
 I'm pretty sure some of you noticed,
 but we've earned so many stars lately  that we're actually out of the hole.
 This is all thanks to you  dumbasses working hard.
 So eat all this meat!
 Swoosh!
 Swooshy, whooshy, whooshy, whoosh!
 Meat! Here! There!
 Everywhere! All of the meat!
 So good!
 Mister Yami's actually treating us!  Today's a damn holiday!
 I'm gonna eat a lifetime's worth of meat!
 Marie, I'll only serve you the best meat.
 Here you go, Marie.
 I've cooked this meat to just above  55 degrees Celsius, just high enough
 to make sure you don't get food poisoning,  but below 60 degrees Celsius,
 since that would make it tough.
 It's the best-cooked meat possible.
 This is his own personal opinion
 Say, ""Aah.""
 It's so good!
 Magna, wanna kill each other  over this hunk of meat?
 Of course not, you idiot!
 Aw, come on!
 Is there anything more blissful  than this? I can barely stand it.
 It's so hot! But so good!
 P-Pwease dun mook at muh ben  I'm meating! It's embarrassing!
 You only eat barbecue with  those who are special to you.
 Asta and I are special friends  who share the same meat...
 Asta, you can't eat with  your arms like that, right?
 Y-You're so helpless. I'll just  have to feed you myself...
 Woohoo! I can eat with my feet now!
 I guess people can learn to do anything!
 You filthy peasant!
 All right, Finral! Show us a trick!
 Huh? O-Oh, sure...
 Secret Technique: Stop Hitting Yourself!
 All right! You're next, Charmy!
 Secret Technique: Instant Disappearing Meat!
 La, la, la...
 All you did was eat it instantly!
 All right, Grey! You're next!
 Do something!
 I can't!
 Shut up and do something!
 S-Secret Technique: M****** ****xe!
 You just turned into what  you usually turn into!
 Wow, everyone's so amazing.
 Everyone has their own special skill.
 I have something that I've been secretly practicing.
 Do you mind if I show you guys?
 Special Technique: Crackling Magna Typhoon!
 Secret Technique: Meaty Sheepy Peacock!
 Next, I'll work out!
 That's not a special trick at all!
 Man, I'm exhausted.  I'm gonna call it a night!
 Well, all right. Make sure  you get plenty of rest!
 Great work, everyone!
 Isn't Asta acting a bit weird?
 Yeah... I mean, when does he ever get tired?
 Exactly. He just seems off today.
 Maybe I'll go cheer him up.
 Maybe if we try to kill  each other, he'll feel better.
 He'll feel better if he eats  some more meat, la!
 I wonder if something happened.
 F-F-Forget I said anything!
 Now that you mention it,  the angle of his smile
 seemed a little lower than usual...
 Marie...
 Guys, I have something to tell you.
 I overheard something when  Asta was getting healed.
 The doctor said that Asta's arms
 will never go back to normal.
 What?
 What... are you saying?
 It looks like some kind of ancient  curse has been placed upon them.
 On top of that, the bones are shattered.
 I'm very sorry, but I won't be able to  heal you with the magic I have now.
 A curse, huh?
 Impressive... You managed  to draw me out, human.
 If that's what the best recovery  mage in the Clover Kingdom said,
 then there's no doubt about it.
 No...
 Just when I thought I'd  found the ultimate partner...
 This is way too harsh.
 The boy has no magic... and now  he can't even use his only weapon?
 La...
 Unbelievable...
 Asta...
 You will never be able to  swing your sword again.
 You will never be able to  swing your sword again.
 Asta...
 Like hell I'm gonna give up!
 You just had to mess with  me again, didn't you, fate?!
 But you're just firing me  up more, you bastard!
 I'm gonna find a way to fix  these arms, no matter what!
 Or I'll find some kind of strength  that lets me fight without my arms!
 And you have no magic whatsoever.
 You must've been born that way.
 Then no matter how hard I try,  I won't be able to use magic?
 Just give up on everything.
 You were born a loser!
 I'm just going to give...
 That one time was the very last time
 I'm ever going to feel depressed!
 Just you wait, you bastard!
 Asta...
 Now that that's settled, time to train!
 Damn straight, kid.
 That's one hot-blooded guy, damn it!
 Way to go, Asta.
 Yup!
 I'm gonna share my snacks with him later, la.
 H-His optimism is absolutely amazing!
 I believe in you.
 His courage is admirable,  but I won't let him near Marie.
 Admirable courage, though.
 Just you wait, Yuno!
 That's right. You can't give up, boy.
 Magic from that country  might be able to save you!
 Good morning, everyone!
 Huh?
 There's usually someone in  here making things lively...
 Did something about the base change again?
 Did everyone already head  out somewhere for the day?
 Hell if I know.
 Is everyone just slacking off?
 They were partying  pretty hard yesterday...
 I sense someone's ki. You can't hide from me!
 That's Noelle and Finral.
 What're they up to?
 Okay, we were able to send  basically everyone off.
 I wish they'd all stop being so secretive.
 Asking me to send them places  because something came up,
 or they suddenly remembered  they had to be somewhere...
 I know they're all sneaking away  to try and find a cure for Asta.
 Huh?
 Though I guess since they're not  technically going on missions,
 Yami might get mad at them.
 Not to mention, Asta would  probably say something like,
 ""Forget about me!  Please put any missions first!""
 Well, this place looks pretty rough.
 You scared, Magna?
 Like hell I am! I'm actually super excited!
 Magna and Luck went to search some dungeon  in a barren part of the Forsaken Realm.
 Just you wait, Asta!
 Gauche and Gordon are researching  hexes at the royal library.
 I want to hurry up and fix Asta's arms so I can hold his hand.
 Our bond will get even stronger  if I can heal his wounds.
 We'll be friends forever.
 Yes, BFFs...
 Stop mumbling and search, damn it.

 I guess it might make Marie  sad if he doesn't get better.
 Gauche is actually putting someone else before his sister for once.
 I need to work harder.
 Charmy and Grey went to search for some  unknown ingredients that work against curses.
 Grey
 Just you wait, Asta!
 I'll find you something that'll cure your  curse, fill your tummy, and be yummy!
 That's... I have no idea what  it is, but it smells delicious, la!
 But I have to hold back!

 Cotton Creation Magic: Sheep Bondage!
 La!
 All right! Let's keep moving forward, la!
 La!
 Who would've thought that the  members of the worst, lowest,
 and crudest squad would be  working so hard for one newbie?
 No kidding. Especially for  such a dumb, reckless,
 vulgar, no-magic peasant like him.
 You don't have to try so hard anymore,
 you filthy little rat that  wandered into the wrong place.
 What the heck is that peasant  from the boonies saying?
 You can't do a thing in this world.
 Even though he doesn't have any magic,
 he just refuses to give up.
 Even though he doesn't have any magic,
 he's the first one into the battle, and he fights harder than anyone else.
 And because he's like that,
 Asta was able to give us  the strength to fight.
 Now, it's our turn to help him fight!
 I... wasn't blessed with any magic.
 That always frustrated me.
 But I sure was blessed  with amazing friends...
 Those dumbasses.
 If only they'd work this hard  at their regular jobs.
 All right, Noelle!
 Why don't we also go look for somewhere  promising together— Crunch.
 Sorry, but there's somewhere  I'd like you to take me.
 You can go wherever you want on your own.
 What? Where are you going?
 I see! They might know  something that we don't.
 Come to think of it...
 Where the heck did Vanessa go?
 She disappeared before anyone else.
 Maybe she has some kind of lead herself.
 I don't have any time to waste, either.  Hurry up and take me.
 Maybe remember you're asking your senior  for a favor... But, yeah, okay.
 Coming.
 Looks like he's home.
 I'm coming in!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Man Named Fanzell
 Asta was gravely injured due to a curse  placed on him by Vetto of the Third Eye.
 The other members of the Black Bulls  headed out to find a cure for his arms.
 Noelle and Finral also visited a  certain man to gain some clues.
 I'm coming in!
 Oh, hey. I just got out of the bath—
 The man that Noelle and Finral came  to see is named Fanzell Kruger.
 Who is this man, and what's  his relationship with Asta?
 To find out, we must look back in time to five months ago.
 5 Months Ago
 A Village Out in the Boonies, Hage
 This story takes place just  shortly before Asta and Yuno
 departed for the royal capital to take the Magic Knights Entrance Exam
 after receiving their grimoires.
 Asta was camping out in a forest  near Hage, training with his sword.
 Wh-Whoa...
 Is this what I'm supposed  to do? I have no idea.
 I never learned how to use a sword.
 I have no idea how to stand or  hold it. Am I practicing right?
 O-Out of the way, boy! Look out!
 Don't come this way!
 Jump to the side!
 Whoa...
 Amazing. You managed to get  rid of it with a single blow.
 I was trying to fish in the river,
 but apparently I was in that boar's territory.
 I-I see...
 Fanzell Kruger
 I'm Fanzell. I'm on a journey.
 Fanzell...
 You can call me Zell.
 Oh, I'm Asta, from Hage Village!
 Nice to meet you, Asta.
 By the way, is that yours?
 Yeah, why?
 Man...
 You're a lifesaver!
 I haven't had a bite in two days.
 I couldn't catch any fish, either.
 Right...
 It's so dry. It's like all the moisture  is being sucked out of my mouth.
 More importantly, why are you naked?
 I didn't want to get my clothes  wet while I was fishing.
 So, what are these?
 You're eating them without  knowing what they are?!
 They're Hage Village's famous tatoes!
 Tatoes, eh?
 You okay?
 Jeez, here.
 Thanks...
 Wait, what is this? It's really bitter.
 It's moguro leaf juice. It's supposed  to increase your magical power!
 I feel much better.
 I'd like to thank you. Why don't  you come over to my house?
 Your house?
 Well, I'm just staying there  without permission, really.
 I had no idea a place like  this existed in the woods.
 I just happened to find an empty house.
 Oh, one sec. I'll go put some clothes on.
 Ah, a sword that negates magic?  I've never seen anything like that before.
 I'm gonna try to pass the Magic Knights  Entrance Exam with this sword!
 That's why I'm camping out  in these woods to train!
 I see.
 What are you doing here, old guy?
 Old guy? I'm only 28, you know...
 What?! You're 28?!
 You sure didn't age well!
 Well, that aside...
 I'm waiting for someone.
 This deep in the mountains?
 A lot's happened.
 Huh...
 By the way, Asta, you're camping out, right?
 Why don't you stay here  while you're training?
 Really? That'd help me out a lot, but...
 You're not planning to  steal my tatoes, are you?
 You should treasure your encounters  and connections with others.
 They might go away one day, but they're all  experiences that build up in your heart.
 Not a chance... He's obviously suspicious.
 Find out more about him.
 Okay, I'll take you up on your offer, Zell!
 Great. Now, let's decide who  gets to chop up the firewood.
 What?!
 Take that!
 Wh-Wh-Whoa!
 This isn't working.
 It's probably because you're not  carrying enough weight on your knees.
 After you initially swing your sword, you try to attack again,
 but it's not working well, right?
 So you lose your balance.
 Y-Yeah...
 Always make sure your toes are facing the  same direction that your sword is pointing.
 Also, keep your right foot about  half a step in front of your left.
 Give it a try.
 I did it!
 I knew I could! Yeah!
 Y-Yeah... You learned that pretty quick.
 Glad it worked.
 All right!
 You're amazing, old guy!  You know how to use a sword?
 Well, it's not exactly  a sword, but... One sec.
 Wind Creation Magic:  Emperor of Slashing Winds.
 Awesome!
 As you can see, my magic  takes the shape of a sword.
 The Emperor of Slashing Winds,  or ""Slash"" for short.
 You're even awesome at naming things!
 So I have some experience  with swords, too.
 Then please show me how to use a sword!
 What?
 Come on, just a little bit!
 Please! Teach me!
 Yeah, sure.
 Huh?
 Sure.
 Y-You sure?
 Yup.
 Th-Thanks.
 Yes! This is awesome!
 All right! Woohoo!
 Awesome! Heck yeah!
 There's just one thing I'd  like you to promise me.
 Yay!
 Asta, why do you want to become stronger?
 To become the Wizard King!
 I see. That's great.
 Excellent.
 You're not gonna laugh at me?
 Why would I laugh?
 Like... say that it's impossible, or whatever.
 You'll never know if it's  impossible if you don't try.
 Promise me...
 that you won't use what I show you
 for anything other than  making your dream come true.
 Sure. What do I need to do?
 Never wrongfully harm others  or pick on the weak.
 As long as you don't use it for anything  bad like that, I'll teach you.
 You don't even need to tell  me not to do stuff like that.
 Then it's a promise.
 Yeah, I promise.
 Okay, let's do our best together.
 Yeah! I look forward to training with you!
 A Few Days Later
 You're following up too late  with your left foot.
 If you're going to attack consecutively,  don't pause between each slash.
 Got it!
 Great job, Asta.
 You're doing well with both  attacking and defending.
 Your movements are improving.
 Since you're this strong,  you should've been able to beat
 that boar on your own no problem.
 I didn't have my sword or  grimoire with me at the time.
 Besides, my swordsmanship  isn't that impressive.
 You're just more skilled than you realize.
 I'm pretty sure you're  just a good teacher, Zell.
 I used to do something like teaching.
 That explains it!
 Though my students never took me seriously.
 I've taught over a hundred students,
 but you're so talented that you'd  probably be in my top three.
 Top three?
 Actually, maybe top two.
 Though the top one doesn't really use a sword  like a sword, so that one wouldn't count...
 But anyway, I think you'll do just fine,  even if you join the Magic Knights.
 You really think so?
 Then let's get right back to training!
 Hey, come on. We're still eating here.
 A few more days passed,  and then she arrived.
 Sorry I'm late, Instructor Fanzell.
 Who're you?
 Mariella! Did you find anything out?
 Mariella?
 She's one of my students.
 Mariella
 She's been helping me look for my fiancée.
 I see. Well, what are you waiting for?
 Shouldn't you look for her yourself?
 Actually... I can't do anything that'll  bring too much attention to me.
 I'm Asta from Hage Village! This old guy's  teaching me how to use my sword.
 Nice to meet ya!
 I'll have you know he's no ordinary man.
 I know he looks old, but he seems even older.
 I don't know who you are, but he's not
 Old...?
 some random old guy that you can  lightly address as ""old guy.""
 I'm only 28...
 I told you! I'm Asta from Hage Village!
 That's what he is, so why  can't I call him that?
 It's a matter of recognition.
 There's a big difference in the amount  of respect you would show him,
 knowing just how ancient he is.
 I didn't hear an ounce of respect  in how you addressed him.
 How the heck is ""old guy"" ever  supposed to sound respectful?
 Uh, could you stop?
 He's just a random old guy! That's all!
 Everything you're saying is pretty hurtful,  considering I'm sitting right here.
 No, you're saying it wrong.
 More importantly, where's Dominante?
 Where's Domina?
 Actually, Miss Domina...
 may have passed away.
 Dude...
 Fanzell explained to Asta what  kind of situation he was in.
 It turned out Fanzell and his fiancée  Dominante belonged to the Diamond army.
 The two of them couldn't bear  the army's cruel ways any longer
 and tried to escape,
 but they were tracked down by  some assassins and got separated.
 Fanzell was supported by his former student, Mariella, who he let escape earlier,
 and she was looking for Dominante.
 If Fanzell made any rash movements,  the assassins would learn of it,
 so he had no choice but to  hide in this house to keep
 Dominante out of danger,  just in case she was nearby.
 That's a lot to take in...
 This is Miss Domina's wand.
 It was on the ground where you  said the assassins attacked.
 I also found quite a bit of blood there.
 I see.
 Sorry, could you leave me alone for a while?
 Pardon me, Instructor...
 Please listen to what I have to say.
 Do you remember when you let me  and the other students escape?
 Yeah.
 Is everyone doing well?
 You actually smiled for a moment.
 Well, you see, everyone else died.
 What?
 Assassins sent by the Diamond Kingdom...
 killed them all.
 What are you...
 Sending the kingdom information
 as well as eliminating any  defectors is my job now.
 If I didn't cooperate,  I'd be killed, just like the others.
 Oh, I won't kill you, though.
 I was told to bring you back alive.
 This place is completely surrounded,  so you won't be able to escape.
 A certain mage warrior has  entered his final stages.
 I'm sure they need your advice on
 the final adjustments he'll  need to function properly.
 That's where you truly belong.
 His name is Mars.
 The boy's name is Mars. Stop talking about  him like he's just some kind of weapon!
 Oh, sure. That really doesn't matter to me.
 You okay, old guy?
 And what the hell, Mariella?
 I thought you were grateful  for all he did for you!
 Of course I am.
 It's true that I was able to survive because  of the fighting techniques he taught me,
 so I still respect him greatly.
 That's why I warned you about  your tone when you address him.
 Then why the heck are you doing this?
 Because if that's all I ever worried about,  I'd never be able to do my job.
 So could you please stay out of our way?
 You don't want to die for some  old man you don't know, do you?
 I know him pretty damn well now!
 No, Asta. Mariella's right.
 You should run.
 You promised me that you would use  whatever I taught you for your dreams.
 It'd be wrong to use that here  for some old guy you don't know.
 Hurry up and run!
 I told you! I know you, old guy!
 Don't worry. I can take care of these  guys even if you're not around.
 But you've been stabbed!
 I promise you I'll get out of this.
 You'd better keep that promise.
 Don't you dare die before I see you next!
 Got it!
 Sorry, Asta. You need to run.
 I...
 Domina...
 Wha—
 Asta, it's okay.
 It doesn't matter what happens to me...
 I've lost the will to live.
 There's no reason.
 Just leave me alone. I'm tired of all this.
 What the hell are you saying?!
 Will to live? A reason to live?
 Of course you're not supposed  to automatically have that!
 You're supposed to find  those things for yourself!
 If you understand, then get  your ass up and join me!
 Wind Creation Magic: Emperor of  Slashing Winds—Winter Wind.
 Awesome!
 That spells sends lots of  Slashes flying out at once.
 I call it the Flying One.
 What an awesome name!
 Sorry about that pathetic display.
 I'm all right now.
 Right!
 Don't let your guard down.
 My guard's not down at all!
 He negated my spell?
 What's wrong, old guy? You done already?
 Only you can decide when you're truly done,
 and you just taught me  that now's not the time.
 I'm not gonna let these  guys finish me like this.
 Let us retreat.
 I'll hold the rear.
 Please make sure to gather the injured.
 You're backing off, just like that?
 To make a surprise attack, you must  have three times the enemy's strength.
 If you lose half your men,  change your strategy.
 If you lose half of that, then retreat.
 That's what a certain someone taught me.
 This isn't the end.
 I'll hunt you down for the rest of your life.
 Bring it on. I'm done running.
 From all of you, as well as myself.
 I'm not going to be discouraged anymore.
 Domina is alive somewhere, I'm sure of it!
 I'm going to search everywhere  for her, so you'd better keep up!
 You hear that, Mariella?
 I hope you're ready to have to deal  with his old man stench forever!
 Could you shut up for a bit?  You're gonna make an old man cry.
 Please do your best.
 Also, your tone has improved.  Don't forget that.
 Are you really going to head out now?
 Yeah, I'm gonna look for  Domina until I find her.
 And I'm going to try to make up for  all the wrongs I did in the meantime.
 I haven't decided exactly how yet,
 but I need to at least spend  the rest of my life trying.
 So I won't die that easily.
 Thanks to you, I've reevaluated my resolve.
 I see.
 Well, if we drag this out any longer,  it'll just be harder to say goodbye.
 See ya, kid.
 Hey! Are you seriously leaving,  just like that?
 I am. Time flows differently  for those who try
 to actually get stuff done  and those who don't.
 I've gotta save time whenever I can.
 Save time? Really?
 You're also someone who  gets stuff done, right?
 Get going, Asta. You already have everything  you need to get what you want done.
 Jeez. Now you act like a proper mentor?
 See ya, old guy!
 You'd better become the Wizard King, kid.
 Well... I guess I should  get back to the village.
 Asta! This is your final lesson!  Defeat this boar!
 Do it yourself!
 Also, why are you naked again?!
 I don't have time to explain!
 Hey! Don't come this way!
 Domina, where are you, my love?
 I believe that you're alive.
 Hey, miss! I'd like to ask you a  question. Wait, don't run away!

 Wait! I promise I'm not someone suspicious!
 Just for a second!
 You're obviously very suspicious!
 Damn it, what's all that racket?
 Get away from me!
 I can't get any sleep.
 Lady Noe?
 La?
 Please stop!
 You've got it all wrong.
 Just for a second, miss...  I'm even willing to pay.
 ""Pan"" and ""pants"" might sound similar,  but pants aren't edible! La!
 You poor girl, running into a pervert like that.
 There, there...
 You twisted bastard. What were you  trying to do to my squad member?
 You better be thankful we didn't kill you.
 Y-You've got the wrong idea.
 I was the victim of a robbery, and...
 No excuses!
 Hey, let's fight some more!  I haven't had enough yet!
 Before he ever has a chance to  appear in front of Marie...
 I'll kill him.
 Hello? Magic Knights HQ?
 This is Finral, the hottie from the Black Bulls.
 We've apprehended someone suspicious,  so we're coming to hand him over to you.
 Wait! Please, wait!  Honestly, this is all a mistake!
 I'm not falling for that. I only use bait when I'm fishing.
 Uh, I don't know much about fishing, but...
 Zell?
 That voice...
 Asta!
 What are you doing here, Zell?
 I see.
 So you were able to join the Magic Knights.
 Congratulations.
 Oh, so it was just a misunderstanding.
 To think that you really were robbed...
 You should've said so earlier!
 I'm pretty sure you guys  weren't going to listen.
 Who cares about the minor details?
 Eat up.
 This is the kind of pan  you can actually eat, la.
 Thanks.
 You're my new friend.
 I want to know more about you.  Let's talk into the morning.
 Um, can I help you?
 Zell, was it? Have we met before?
 No, I'm pretty sure this is  the first time we've ever met.
 So what are you doing here, old man?
 Oh, right.
 Noelle, was it?
 I'm truly sorry for scaring you.
 I wanted to ask you about your wand.
 My wand?
 Yes.
 I'm fairly certain that the wand
 you're using was created by  Domina, who I'm looking for.
 Domina?
 Isn't that your fiancée?
 But the person who gave me  this wand was named Code.
 Right. It wasn't Domina.
 So I was right. There's no doubt about it.
 Her full name is Dominante Code.
 Where'd you get that?
 The black market in the castle city.
 I see...
 Thank goodness.
 Thank goodness.
 Old man! That means Domina's alive!
 That's great! Hurry up and go see her!
 Yeah, I will.
 Thank you. Thank you!
 I'll lead you there.
 Thank you, Noelle.
 Because of you, I should be able to reunite  with someone very important to me.
 Thank you so much.
 I-I didn't do that much.
 So, can I go, Captain?
 Huh? Sure, why not?
 Oh, but don't blab about us trying  to get you arrested by mistake.
 You actually just admitted  you made a mistake.
 Shut up.
 Oh, yeah. Finral, take them to their  destination with your spatial magic.
 Then we're even.
 I'm gonna take a dump and go to bed.
 Sure.
 Thanks.
 Well, if I stick around too long,  it'll make it harder to say goodbye.
 See you, Asta.
 It wasn't for very long, but I'm  glad I got to see you again.
 Let's meet again. And make  sure you become the Wizard King!
 Heck yeah! And you better  live happily ever after!
 Everyone, get down!
 La!
 Whoa, what? Are we being attacked?
 They're probably the assassins  who were after me.
 I'll leave immediately.
 The hell is this? Who do I  need to kill for this, and how?
 I don't see any movement.
 Knowing Instructor Fanzell,  I thought he'd come straight out.
 Let's see how things play out.
 Diamond Kingdom Assassination Squad Commander Galleo
 Squads 1 through 4, maintain formation and advance.
 Squads 5 and 6, stand by.
 Is that building some kind  of apartment complex?
 I'm not sure. I'm going now.
 Commander Galleo, could you  use your spatial magic?
 For insurance, just in case this  surprise attack fails, huh?
 I don't think that's necessary, but fine.
 We'd be a laughing stock if a  plan like this actually failed.
 What's with the glare? Did you forget who let you live?
 I know I owe you my life.
 Don't forget it.
 So I'd like to give you some advice.
 My instructor...
 is very strong.
 Scout from Unit 1 reporting. We're within twenty meters of the building.
 All right, prepare to attack.
 There's the target. Don't let  him get away. After him!
 Lightning Creation Magic:  Thunderbolt Destruction!
 Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!
 Hey, what the hell? Our surprise  attack actually worked.
 Maybe these guys aren't so strong after all.
 That works for me. Looks like  there are plenty of them,
 so let's have them play with us  until their kneecaps shatter!
 Squads 1 and 2, continue pursuing the target.
 Are you the commander?
 I'm going to end this quickly  so I can go see Marie.
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!
 Wh-What is this magic?
 Guess I'll get things started.
 Darkness Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!
 None shall ever lay a finger on my food.
 Don't go too overboard. Make sure you leave some for me.
 That water barrier...
 It wasn't created to stop our attacks,
 but so their own magic  wouldn't destroy the place.
 You the commander?
 You're Fanzell!
 Don't! You can't lay a finger on me!
 Don't you care what happens to the hostage?
 Hostage? Who?
 Dominante Code...  Mariella's heading to her now.
 Did you think we didn't  know where Code was hiding?
 Now, let go of me, or—
 Man, the captain's amazing.
 To think he was exactly  right about what's going on.
 What?
 My teammates are heading out to protect
 Domina via spatial magic as we speak.
 They've probably already found her.
 Wh-Who are you?
 Just how long does it take you to  come get me, you worthless fiancé?!
 How dare you leave a delicate  flower like me alone for so long?!
 Dominante Code
 I... was so worried! I was  afraid you were hurt!
 You're kind of hurting me right now...
 Thank you, young lady.
 I never thought you'd do this much for me  just because I gave you a little extra.
 Looks like Bruce was right about you.
 I'm not so sure about that...
 And you must be Asta.
 Huh? How do you—
 You look as gutsy as I've heard!
 Who told you that?
 Who?
 You're Mariella!
 I won't do anything violent.
 What are you expecting a  single girl to do, anyway?
 You and your buddies beat the  crap out of your instructor!
 You're probably plotting  the same thing again!
 I mean no harm,  but please allow me to use you.
 Huh?
 What do you mean?
 Ah, so you're the Black Bulls...
 Did Mariella have us attack  without knowing who they were?
 You had those guys attack the Black Bulls'  base so we'd take care of them?
 While that was happening,  I headed to the black market
 to tell Miss Domina that  the instructor was coming,
 so we were getting prepared.
 Though I didn't think you'd get here so fast.
 I've drawn out a safe  escape route on this map.
 Why are you doing this for us?
 Mariella?
 Including the ones that  were sent to the city,
 we'll be able to take care of  about sixty assassins at once.
 On top of that, Instructor Fanzell and  Miss Domina will be able to escape.
 I'm sure these incidents will set  the organization back substantially.
 This is my revenge against the organization.
 Revenge?
 Just like Instructor Fanzell...  I'm tired of this job.
 But I'm also not prepared to be  on the run for the rest of my life
 like Instructor Fanzell and Miss Domina.
 In the end, I decided to exact a huge revenge,
 then present myself to the  Clover Kingdom's Magic Knights.
 You just... decided that?
 I was waiting for all of  these circumstances to align.
 And then,
 I just happened to see Instructor Fanzell  being dragged into the Black Bulls' base.
 I thought if I got you involved,  you'd annihilate the assassins.
 Did you, now?
 You make it sound so easy.
 So please, capture me. Then this  will end happily ever after.
 Do you really think it'll work out that well?
 Considering everything you've done,  you'll probably be severely punished,
 and you might face retaliation from the  organization while you're serving time.
 And that's perfectly fine.
 I'll be content with accepting  anything other than death.
 Remember when you said, ""You're supposed  to find a reason to live for yourself""?
 What about it?
 It was condescending.  Who do you think you are?
 Huh?!
 But your words resonated with me.
 You were really cool.
 R-Really?
 The punishment I receive
 will be the cost for me to restart  and atone for everything I've done.
 That's why I believe I need to accept the  punishment, no matter how severe it may be.
 Mariella...
 I don't think so!
 Galleo!
 You're a commander, and you deserted your squads?
 That's awful!
 You're the last person I  want to hear that from!
 If you want to be executed so badly,
 I'll personally do it for you,  right here, right now!
 Everyone, please run.
 He might not sound too dangerous,  but his magic is a bit troublesome.
 Spatial Creation Magic: Unopening Red Room!
 Asta!
 Spatial Creation Magic: Crevice Men!
 Who the heck are these creepy guys?
 And what's this creepy room?
 This is a room that Galleo  created with magic,
 and those things are magic soldiers  that he can only create in here.
 They're strong. But more importantly,  what were you doing?
 Why would you throw yourself in front of  a spell without knowing the consequences?
 If that had been an attack spell,  you might be dead right now.
 Are you stupid?
 Stupid?
 Oh, shut up!
 If it means just letting  someone die, I'd rather be stupid!
 Not to mention, I'm not  the same person anymore!
 Now I'm Asta, a member of the  Magic Knights squad, the Black Bulls!
 B-But I'm your enemy!
 I don't care!
 When there's someone in need, I can help  them out as much as I want, whenever I want!
 So take that!
 Now that you get that, let me  save you while you support me!
 I can't be as big-hearted as him,
 but I can't just sit back and watch  when my student's in trouble.
 Let's work together and get through this!
 Get through this... Can we, though?
 This is nothing!
 Th-These two...
 Magic Knights HQ?
 Hey, this is Yami from the Black Bulls.
 I captured a bunch of troublemakers. Could you hurry and come get them?
 That guy had this many people after him?
 Who the hell is that Fanzell guy?
 Fanzell? Wasn't his name Zell?
 Uh, Grey said that his real name is Fanzell.
 Oh!
 He's Fanzell Kruger.
 He was one of the commanders of  the Diamond Kingdom's armies.
 I met him a long time ago during a battle.
 Captain...
 I'd heard he became an instructor for  other soldiers, but he must've defected.
 So that's why all these guys were after him.
 You're making this sound  like it's not our problem...
 Wait, does that mean we ended up  aiding a major enemy's escape?
 That'd be correct.
 Hey, Gauche...
 Yes, sir?
 Don't mention this to anyone.
 I won't tell a soul, so please give  me a week of Marie vacation.
 You're only allowed to see her  once a month, aren't you?
 I'll spend 168 hours of the week staring at  Marie in such a way that I won't get caught!
 Oh, for crying out loud...
 And so, the mysterious incident in  which the Black Bulls' base got attacked
 came to an end.
 Are you sure it's all right for us to leave?
 I have a feeling we'd be causing you  trouble if we just disappeared.
 Captain Yami didn't seem to  care about that, so it's fine.
 Right, Finral?
 Y-Y-Yeah, sure...
 I'm pretty sure it's not fine!
 I have a really bad feeling about this.
 And are you guys sure you  want to take that brat
 with the terrible personality with you?
 I didn't choose to have  this terrible personality.
 I heard that they were going to try to  kidnap me, but she put a stop to that.
 And if you think about it,
 she's the reason I was able  to be reunited with Zell.
 I'm not sure if you're just too nice, or...
 Honestly, you're all pushovers.
 That's why I can trick you all so easily.
 Besides, I didn't ask you to do all of this.
 Even if I don't have help  from you pushovers...
 You can survive on your own?
 Just like you have been?
 It's actually a lot easier to carry  all the burden yourself, isn't it?
 You can just tell yourself that as long as  you can get through it, you'll be fine.
 And you don't have to think  about everyone around you,
 so you don't have to think  about anything else.
 But that's not possible anymore.
 When people care for you,
 none of your problems are  just your own anymore.
 You have to think about them, too.
 So I hope you suffer.
 You seem to have a terrible  personality yourself.
 I don't want people to think I  have a good personality, anyway.
 Hmph!
 Well, if we linger too long,  the goodbyes will be—
 Stop getting all emotional!
 Go on, old man!
 Time flows differently for  those who actually try
 to get stuff done and  those who don't, right?
 So get going, and make Domina happy!
 Yeah, I will.
 I won't waste this precious  time that's been given to me.
 From now on, I'll do my best  to live along with these two.
 That's the spirit!
 I'll write you a letter once  everything settles down.
 Sure! Take care!
 So, uh... I hate to ask  at a time like this...
 But you know how I lost all  my belongings to the assassins
 right before you guys hauled  me off to your hideout?
 Don't tell me...
 Could you lend me some money?
 I never should've saved you!
 This was how Fanzell, Domina,  Mariella, and the Black Bulls met.
 And currently, Noelle and  Finral have come to visit Fanzell
 in search of a way to heal Asta's arms.
 Domina, Mariella, how have you be—
 You worthless husband! Would you fix  your bad habit of getting naked already?!
 Hey, stop! That's something I can't control!
 This house is already pretty run-down.  Could you not mess it up more?
 I see... So something like  that happened to Asta?
 He's been through a lot  for someone so young.
 His streak of bad luck is quite  the contrast to his height.
 Do you have any ideas on how to fix  Asta's arms? Even if it's just a rumor?
 An ancient curse, huh?
 There's one thing I can think of.
 My home, the Witches' Forest.
 The Witches' Forest?
 With the magic of the queen there...
 Hey!
 The smartest witch to ever grace this world
 since the creation of the  land of witches is back!
 I need something, so open up!
 We might be able to fix Asta's arms!
 All right! Let's infiltrate  the Witches' Forest!
 Ooh, so many pretty witchies!
 I'm gonna infiltrate that girl's heart!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 In order to heal Asta's arms,
 which were rendered useless  after the battle with Vetto,
 Noelle and Finral went  to visit certain exiles...
 I'm coming in!
 Oh, hey. I just got out of the bath—
 You worthless husband! Would you fix  your bad habit of getting naked already?!

 Brilliant Magic Item Artisan Dominante Code
 his fiancée and brilliant magic  item artisan, Dominante Code,
 Former Assassin Mariella
 and the former assassin, Mariella.
 Do you have any ideas on how to fix  Asta's arms? Even if it's just a rumor?
 An ancient curse, huh?
 There's one thing I can think of.
 My home, the Witches' Forest.
 The Witches' Forest?
 With the magic of the queen there...
 Meanwhile, at the Witches' Forest...
 Hey!
 The smartest witch to ever grace this world
 since the creation of the  land of witches is back!
 I need something, so open up!
 Infiltration
 Domina, what's the Witches' Forest?
 It's an autonomous region that lies east
 of the Clover Kingdom, near the  border of the Diamond Kingdom.
 Clover Kingdom
 Diamond Kingdom
 Witches' Forest
 All of the inhabitants are women,
 and they're essentially witches  who are skilled in
 special magic such as curses and familiars.
 All women?! What is this magical place?
 Don't forget, we're talking  about witches here.
 I've known of men who got too close
 and got turned into stink bugs or softshell  turtles, then dropped into toilets.
 What?
 Wait... Speaking of witches...
 Oh, right.
 Could it be that Vanessa suddenly disappeared
 to try and get their queen to fix Asta's arms?
 There's a rule stating that witches  can only live in the Witches' Forest.
 Which means that witches like Vanessa and  myself who left our home are fugitives.
 Fugitives?
 She'd need great resolve to  even consider going back.
 But...
 I fell head over heels in love with  my soulmate Zell, so what can I do?
 Yup. We both dove head-first into  the bottomless swamp called love.
 My sweet Zell...
 My sweet Domina...
 Darling!
 You guys are so in love... I'm so jealous!
 So I believed in you and followed you,
 so how long are you gonna make me live  in this hovel, you worthless husband?!
 She's continuously aiming  at his vital points.
 Maybe she should've been the assassin here.
 Y-Yikes...
 Maybe I'm not so jealous after all.
 Why don't we get back on track?
 Yeah, that would be great.
 Yeah.
 If Vanessa went back into  that forest... I'm worried.
 I don't know all the details, but apparently  Vanessa was very important to the queen.
 If the rumors are true and she returns,
 she'll never be able to  leave the forest again.
 To be blunt, the queen is supreme.
 She's so powerful that even the  Diamond Kingdom won't try to deal with her.
 Not to mention that it's impossible  to reason with her.
 Let me warn you, if you're also planning  to go to the Witches' Forest...
 If you anger the queen,
 you won't be able to come back alive.
 We're going.
 If there's a clue to healing  Asta's arms there...
 Yeah.
 Please... Tell us how to get there.
 I'll go, too.
 B-But...
 Don't worry.
 I won't let anyone lay  a finger on my beloved.
 Asta helped me out a lot and  showed me the way I needed to go.
 I owe him bigtime.
 It doesn't feel great to let  that debt keep growing, either.
 Let us repay it.
 Yeah.
 Besides, I can't leave my  last student hanging like this.
 For now, I'm just gonna strengthen  my lower body a heck of a lot!
 Not yet! I'm not done yet, damn it!
 My goal is to look like this!
 Ow!
 I got a cramp!
 What?!
 Heya, Asta.
 O-Old Man Zell?!
 Wait, what the heck is going on?!
 We can talk about this later.
 If we tell him why we're here...
 I can't let all of you go to such  a dangerous place for my sake!
 ...is what he'll probably say,  so we'll avoid that for now.
 Come on, let's go to the W's Forest.
 What the heck is ""W""?! Is it a size?  Is it an extra-wide forest or something?!
 I can't talk!
 I shut him up.
 Good job, Zell.
 Excellent work, Master.
 The only method I could think of for  shutting someone up was killing them.
 Um... You might want to  rethink your priorities.
 Let's hurry.
 Fhats fwoing on?!
 The other day, this guy in front  of the forest tried to talk to me
 and kept breathing really hard!  Talk about gross!
 Seriously? Like, ew.
 By the way, I thought I saw  Vanessa a little while ago...
 What? No way.
 I don't even want to imagine  what the queen would do if
 a witch who broke the rules was found.
 Imperfect.
 Vanessa, ever since you left this forest,
 my plans strayed far from perfection.
 If you master your thread  magic as I told you to,
 you'll be able to control destiny itself.
 And yet you let that man tempt you away...
 Queen of Witches
 A man... A mere human, at that.
 We are perfect witches,  and yet you let him use you...
 Aren't you ashamed?!
 Oh, dear...
 What an imperfect room.
 You're the one who's imperfect.
 Listen up. I'll only come  back on one condition.
 Teach me ancient dispelling magic!
 A little girl who doesn't understand  her place needs to be disciplined.
 That's the Witches' Forest.
 Witches' Forest?!
 What the heck is that?! Where are we?
 Shh! We need to be extra  careful from here on out!
 What? What's going on?
 We seem to be in ""Let's begin  the operation!"" mode now...
 I'll explain later.
 When the heck is later?!
 We're already here! You're dragging this out too much!
 Just shut up for a while.
 Otherwise...
 ...we'll shut you up again.
 Really?!
 Domina, please continue.
 The queen runs her overwhelming  magic throughout the forest,
 so if we give off even a little magic,  they'll know we're here immediately.
 Which means we won't be able  to use my spatial magic.
 You don't even have to use it.
 If anyone with magic so much as  enters here, they'll immediately know.
 And what happens if they find us?
 Have you ever seen a honeycomb?
 Uh, I don't have any magic,  so I should be fine.
 Shh!
 But then how are we supposed to get inside?
 And that's where
 these cloaks I made come in!
 I call them Vanishawls!
 Put one of these babies on, and ta-da!
 Your magic, your presence, and  your body will all disappear!
 Wow, that's amazing! But it  must be expensive, right?
 Oh, not at all! If you order right now,  you can get one for just 30,000 yuls!
 Wow, that's so cheap! Way too cheap!
 And today, we have a one-time special offer!  I'll throw in another one for free!
 The best of the best! Get your magic  items from Domina's Magic Items!
 Buy your ""Vanishawl"" now for 30,000 yuls and get another one absolutely free!
 Yay!
 Is this enough?
 Whoa, that's way too much!
 Hey, I was kidding! Of course,  they're free of charge.
 That's also a lie. You looked  rather hopeful for a moment.
 I'm sure she was startled by  how much Noelle offered her.
 Oh, hey! There's another way in over there!
 Let's go in from there!
 Woohoo! Onward to witchy paradise!
 Seriously, what are we doing?!
 Just shut up, Asta!
 What?!
 I hate them. I hate all humans.
 They hurt us
 and steal everything from us.
 Lady Fana.
 It appears that the Black Bulls we were  monitoring are up to something strange.
 I will burn them all.
 They hurt Licht and took Vetto's life.
 I will... make them pay!
 And then, when I went to the city,
 this guy who kept breathing hard  gave me a bouquet of a hundred roses!
 Ew, gross!
 Th-This is really cramped.
 I could kill someone right now.
 I'm really sorry.
 This Vanishawl was originally  made to fit just one person.
 But this is better than being caught  and becoming a human honeycomb, right?
 I guess we'll just have to deal  until we get to the queen.
 I mean, we're better off than them, at least.
 Sorry about the sausage fest.
 Apparently she only made  two of these cloaks.
 And to think there are some cute little  witchies right over there, giggling away...
 Could you please tell me  what we're doing here now?
 Hey, couldn't you sell this  love potion a little cheaper?
 I can't go any lower.
 L-Love potion?!
 Did you hear a man's voice just now?
 You must be hearing things. There's no  way a man could get into this forest.
 You're right.
 Man, I panicked...
 Sorry. I only ever imagined love  potions in my wildest dreams.
 Gole!
 Wh-What the heck is that? It's sorta cute.
 That's a security golem.
 They're small, but if they find intruders,  they become a pain.
 They'll call their friends and  start firing magic bullets.
 Then what you said earlier  about honeycombs...
 Yes. If they spot us, we're finished.
 They'll fill us with  holes until we drop dead.
 They get under your guard with their cute appearance, then they ruthlessly attack.
 They're perfect assassins.
 It's heading toward us.
 Don't worry. They won't find us  as long as we're under this cloak.
 Okay, now it's our turn.
 Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...
 How?!
 Gole?
 Heya... Nice place you got here.
 Gole...
 You worthless husband!
 Gah! A naked old man is clinging to me!
 What the heck are you doing, Old Man Zell?!
 I promise this isn't on purpose. I'm sorry!
 He can't help it. That's the  kind of thing Master is into.
 You couldn't hold back, could you?
 No, I just...
 A cold glare from my own student...
 Huh?
 What's going on?
 Men?!
 Intruders!
 Jeez! We'll just have to blast our way  through to the queen's manor!
 Right! Might as well use my spatial magic,  then! We'll take the shortest route!
 The most handsome member of the Black Bulls: Finral Roulacase My contact info is written on the back!!
 Hello, ladies!
 Why are we stopping?!
 A naked old man!
 The most handsome member of the Black Bulls: Finral Roulacase My contact info is written on the back!!
 Why don't we have some tea later?
 Seriously, Finral!
 You freak!
 The most handsome member of the Black Bulls: Finral Roulacase My contact info is written on the back!!
 I'll be waiting for your reply.
 Are we going to the place or what?!
 Hey, you pervert...
 What are you staring at?!
 This isn't the shortest route at all!
 None of them are giving me the time of day.
 I still haven't recovered from the shock.
 Crap! We're surrounded!
 Special Magic Item: Spew-Smoke.
 The name tells you exactly what it does, huh?
 This smoke has traces of magic in it.
 It'll work as a smokescreen  for just a short while.
 This is our chance to head  straight to the queen's manor!
 Yeah!
 There it is!
 What the heck? Is it under construction?
 Perfect! Let's dive right in!
 I scraped my back because  I wasn't wearing a shirt.
 That's your own fault for  being into that sort of thing.
 You've got it all wrong! This was  seriously just a coincidence!
 Ow...
 Imperfect...
 Miz Vanessa!
 Vanessa!
 Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
 I don't know who you think you are,  but get your foot off of her right now!
 How dare an intruder like yourself  address me in such a way?
 I am the queen of this forest,
 the mother of all witches.
 That girl over there,
 as well as Vanessa, are  my descendants. My children.
 A child who doesn't listen to her mother  needs a little discipline, don't you think?
 What?!
 This is a family matter.
 Outsiders should stay out of it.
 I am free to do whatever  I want to my daughters.
 You may be the Queen of Witches or whatever...
 But that's got nothing to do with what I said.
 I told you to get your foot off of her!
 Imperfect.
 Asta!
 What is this? You have no magic?
 What a vile, imperfect little brat.
 That's right... I've got no magic.
 And right now, I can't  even fight with my swords.
 But I'm still better than anyone  who'd step on their own family!
 You must be the brat  Vanessa was talking about.
 Why does she want to fix trash like you?
 Even sacrificing herself...
 This foolish little thing
 told me she'd become my slave and  live out the rest of her days here
 in exchange for healing your arms.
 Miz Vanessa...
 Wait... Is that why they're here, too?
 You told me that you'd become  the Wizard King someday, didn't you?
 I want you to make that dream come true.
 Me, too.
 ""When people care for you,
 none of your problems are  just your own anymore.""
 Right, Noelle?
 Yes.
 Guys...
 And with that...
 Impressive. Especially since  I hid any intent to harm you.
 But...
 Old man!
 Yes. I was able to distract you  while the old man saved Asta.
 Yup. This old man worked hard.
 So can we stop calling me that now?
 Now, then...
 Wind Creation Magic:  Emperor of Slashing Winds.
 Now get your foot off of her!
 Miz Vanessa is one of us!
 You fools.
 What could imperfect creatures  such as yourselves possibly do?
 This little girl,
 as well as all of you,  cannot escape your fates.
 All that waits for you is the end  seen in my divination here.
 They were much faster than I expected.
 I knew they would be coming,
 but to think they'd choose a  time like this to show up.

 The Forest of G.
 Bah-ha! I bought an amazing magic item  through the Magic Shopping Network.
 Bah-ha!
 This is an amazing item that makes  you and your magic disappear!
 It cost me five million yuls,  but if I can finally enter the garden
 of beautiful women known as the  Witches' Forest, it's a bah-hargain.
 It'll only take twelve years to pay it off!
 But this is bah-hazzare...
 The Witches' Forest should be around here.
 What's wrong?
 Bah-ha?!
 What was that?!
 Let's be friends.
 Ha-bah?!
 Who's there?! You're giving me the creeps!
 I'm Gordon.
 I'm also Gordon.
 Heya, I'm Gordon.
 We're all Gordon.
 Call us ""Donnie.""
 Bah-ha!

 This is the Forest of Gordons!

 The Eye of the Midnight Sun is  attacking the Witches' Forest.
 What? Apparently another force  is also trying to attack.

58,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Vetto cast an ancient curse on Asta's arms.
 The only hope of healing his arms was
 the Queen of Witches,  who lives in the Witches' Forest.
 But...
 To be blunt, the queen is supreme.
 She's so powerful that even the  Diamond Kingdom won't try to deal with her.
 Not to mention that it's impossible  to reason with her.
 We're going.
 If there's a clue to healing  Asta's arms there...
 Meanwhile, Vanessa was  also visiting her home,
 the Witches' Forest, in order to fix Asta's arms.
 There it is!
 Yeah!
 When Asta and the others reached  the Queen of Witches, they saw...
 Now get your foot off of her!
 Miz Vanessa is one of us!
 You fools.
 What could imperfect creatures  such as yourselves possibly do?
 They were much faster than I expected.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 Battlefield Decision
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun?
 Why are they heading here?
 Y-You're not just saying  that to trick us, are you?
 How imperfect.
 If I chose to do so, I could end your  pathetic lives at this very moment.
 Why would I need to lie?
 She was at Nean!
 She's from the Third Eye or whatever,  just like the hairy gorilla
 that did this to my arms!  She's super bad news!
 Then she's probably as powerful as Vetto.
 She could be even more powerful!
 You can't be serious!  Please tell me you're lying!
 It matters not.
 I will be more than happy to rid this  world of any imperfect creatures.
 Warn the others.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun Fana the Hateful
 The Queen of Witches, who pilfered one  of the magic stones, lives in that forest.
 The humans that stole Vetto's  life are also there.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun Shidan
 Indeed. They might have realized  the magic stone is there, as well.
 They're unforgivable. I'll destroy everything  and take the magic stone.
 I'm sure Master Licht will be pleased.
 It seems they are with the queen  in the middle of the forest.
 Let us burn them all and make examples  of them to the rest of the world.
 Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.
 Flames!
 We're being attacked!
 The forest...
 S-Such powerful flame magic...
 The Flame Spirit, Salamander.
 Its form is still not complete,  and yet it's this powerful...
 It's much stronger than I predicted.
 My readings were slightly off.
 Any time fate veers off-course,  more deviations follow.
 It can't be...
 There are more of them!
 Th-That's...
 Near the border of the Diamond Kingdom.
 Yeah.
 As I suspected...
 I thought this fate would  come to pass much later,
 but the other force that wishes  to attack this forest...
 The Diamond Kingdom.
 You can't be serious. They're coming here?
 One of the Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals Ladros
 Man... and just as I was relaxing  in a nice aromatherapy bath.
 What's with the emergency summons?
 We got word that the
 One of the Diamond Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals Mars
 Eye of the Midnight Sun is going  to attack the Witches' Forest.
 We have been ordered to take advantage  of the chaos that will cause
 to capture the Queen of Witches.
 We could do that easily  without being so sneaky.
 Orders are orders.
 That really pale guy...
 It's the super strong guy  we fought in the dungeon!
 Thank goodness... He's alive!
 Should you be happy about that?!
 S-Seriously?! What's going on?
 This was already bad enough,  but it just keeps getting worse!
 Why does this keep happening lately?!
 Is that... Mars?
 Then the one next to him must be Ladros.
 Zell...
 Anyway, we have to protect  the Witches' Forest!
 I'll defeat both the Eye of the  Midnight Sun and the Diamonds!
 And how are you going to  do that with those arms?
 That's right!
 The whole reason we even came  here was to fix your arms.
 Right...
 So much is going on that I totally forgot!
 He's got a point.
 Damn it all!
 Captain?
 Asta? Wait, what are you doing here?
 Miz Vanessa!
 Thank goodness! You're awake!
 Vanessa!
 Honestly, you were trying to  do way too much by yourself.
 Noelle... Finral...
 You're here, too?
 Huh? And some other familiar faces...
 Though one appears to have lost his shirt.
 Well, you see...
 That's just his hobby.
 No, really, it isn't.
 It's been a while, Vanessa.
 We were also looking for  a way to cure Asta's arms
 and ended up in the same place as you.
 That's right!
 Just you wait, Asta.  I'm going to talk to the queen
 and have her fix your arms!
 I decline your offer!
 Huh?
 It would be in exchange  for your freedom, right?
 I refuse to let you do that!
 Wha... How can you be so selfish?!
 This is the only way, you moron!
 You're the one being  selfish here, Miz Vanessa!
 How could you sneak back home  without telling anyone, you drunk?!
 Well, what was I supposed to do, you shrimp?!
 U-Uh, calm down, you two...
 I'll figure it out!
 And how are you going to do that?!
 Shut up!
 Even Asta told me to shut up!
 But I have seniority...
 You don't have to go through all this. I still have my last resort!
 H-Hey, Asta!
 H-His eyes look a little crazed, don't they?
 I have a bad feeling about this.
 Wh-What are you trying to do?
 This!
 That sword...
 Ow!
 Asta!
 What are you doing, you moron?!
 That curse has sunk deep into your arms!
 No matter how crazy you try to get,
 you can't always compete  with the fate you're dealt!
 So you're telling me that  it's my fate to sacrifice
 one of my friends for my arms to get better?!
 Who the hell's gonna abide by that?!
 I don't care if I have to crush fate itself!  I'm gonna fight with these arms!
 Huh? It's your fate to stay here?
 Oh, yeah, yeah. Good ol' fate.
 I hate that crap.
 Who the hell's gonna abide by that?
 I'm gonna do what I want, even if it  means I have to crush fate itself.
 He just said the same  thing Captain Yami did.
 One more time!
 You idiot!
 That's enough!
 Your friends aren't here to be sacrificed!
 They're here to win against a fate  that you can't fight on your own!
 I have no intention of sacrificing  myself for you, either!
 After I use the queen to fix your arms,
 I'm going to use that anti-magic of yours
 to get the hell out of here!
 Crap...
 Oh, then you should've just said so.
 Uh, I'm pretty sure you shouldn't  have said that out loud...
 Hey, Queenie.
 If you can actually dispel Asta's curse,  could you go ahead and do it already?
 Looks like your forest's in a lot of trouble.
 He wants to save the people  out there as soon as possible.
 He's an idiot, but he's strong.
 I'm sure he'll be useful to you if you heal him!
 And if he goes,
 we'll follow.
 The enemy is immense.
 Couldn't you use all the manpower  you can get right now?
 If you're truly a queen, you should be  doing whatever's best for your forest!
 It's true. We currently lack the strength  to deal with the impending attackers.
 Very well. I shall heal that brat's arms.
 I'll even make them sturdier than before.
 Sturdier? Really? Are they gonna be  huge like Captain Yami's, then?
 I highly doubt that.
 Sturdiness isn't necessarily  equal to how big they are.
 Aw, come on!
 What am I supposed to do about it?
 You've got some guts, Noelle!
 Yeah! I've never seen anyone  talk down to the queen before!
 I'm royalty myself.
 My legs are still shaking...
 Be merry while you still can.
 But in the end, both Vanessa
 and that boy's anti-magic  sword's powers shall be mine.
 Blood Recovery Magic:  Curse-Breaking Blood-Filled Cocoon.
 My arms feel so light! This is awesome!
 She performed such a powerful  spell in a mere instant?
 This is the power of the queen?
 This is great! They're completely better!
 Look! Look, look, look, look!
 Asta!
 Look, look, look, look!
 Now, when my back itches, I don't  have to scratch it against a pole!
 And I can pick my nose!
 But what I'm happiest about is that  I'll be able to work out again!
 Asta...
 He's still an idiot.
 Well, I don't know if they're  actually sturdier or not,
 but I can feel strength welling up inside me!
 All right! Let's go, guys!
 Yeah!
 All right! Let's go, guys!
 Yeah!
 Or...
 ""Let's go,"" my ass!
 Do you know how worried we were?!
 You crazy moron!
 You could barely move a second ago!
 Take that! And that! And that! And that!
 Here! Take your stupid robe!
 Thank you so much, guys! And I'm sorry!
 No effect!
 They're so hard!
 What the heck? Did she use  a strengthening spell?!
 No! They're just pure muscle! Hurgh!
 Congrats, Asta.
 Yeah! Thank you all for what you did, too!
 I've fulfilled my end of the bargain.
 Now let us see this so-called power of yours.
 Yeah! Leave this to us!
 Thanks for fixing my arms!
 Hmph.
 Asta, leave the Diamond forces to us.
 Mars and Ladros... I have some  unfinished business with them.
 All right, Old Man Zell. Don't die.
 Yeah.
 And put some clothes on.
 Right...
 You, too!
 Burn! Burn!
 Have they given up after a  single attack by Lady Fana?
 They're weaker than I thought.
 L-Look!
 They must be the enemies  you warned us about!
 How dare you do this?!
 Let's go, Akimo!
 Yeah! Let's protect the forest!
 Wh-What's that monster?
 Stay calm.
 The queen's golem!
 Wh-Who are those guys?
 The great Third Eye is magnificent!
 Lady Fana is not only immensely  powerful, but also beautiful.
 I'd love to have a shot at her  if I ever get the chance.
 But I guess I'll just have to settle  for these lowly witches today.
 Attack!
 Yes, sir!
 Make sure you capture the lookers alive.
 These witches possess powerful magic.  They'll make excellent slaves.
 N-No!
 Are you okay?!
 Huh?
 Eek! I was saved by a man!
 Your muscles are gross!
 Hmph.
 What the heck was that for?!
 The witches firmly believe  that women are superior.
 Sorry she acted like that  after you saved her.
 I'll put out all the flames.
 Thanks, Noelle.
 I'll rescue all the witchies!
 I'm counting on you, Finral!
 You've got some nerve,  doing this to the forest.
 This place isn't the best,  but it was still my home.
 I'll protect it, no matter what.
 Let's go, Asta!
 You got it!
 Oh, hey. There it is.
 I can't wait!
 Diamond Kingdom Mohawq
 We are prepared to attack at any time.
 Well, aren't you psyched?
 But... Tsk, tsk, tsk... Hold your horses.
 Where's the fun in dealing with the peons?
 We're going to enjoy whoever's  left from both sides later on.
 Yes, sir!
 They're here.
 Those numbers... Even with all the witches,  we're still vastly outnumbered.
 But what's important is how  you fight. Right, Master?
 Yeah.
 Let's all split up.
 B-But I swore that I'd protect you.
 Thanks, Zell. But this  isn't the time for that.
 You were considered a genius strategist,  so you should already know...
 This is the only way we can win.
 All right.
 So many excellent slave  ladies to choose from!
 Let us go!
 That bastard! What does he  think he's doing to my cuties?!
 The number of guards he has around him...  He must be the commander.
 Miz Vanessa!
 Use your threads to blast me up to them!
 What? But I won't be able to  pull you back at that distance!
 You'd be fighting in the air  with nothing to hold you up!
 I'll be fine!
 Well, if you're sure... I'll trust you!
 Who the heck is that?
 Fool! He's headed right toward us!
 Take this!
 No, you take this!
 That's... the anti-magic brat  who defeated Lord Vetto!
 Kill him!
 There!
 He's using the enemies as stepping stones.
 I can't believe that boy!  Then again, I guess I can.
 You guys cause trouble every single time!
 Wh-What's with this brat?
 Now no one...
 will be able to stop Asta!
 Quit it already!
 Now's your chance to run!
 Stop bossing me around, you stupid man!
 I'm not thanking you!
 Let's go!
 Seriously?!
 There you are.
 How dare you kill Vetto?
 I'll kill you!
 Crap! I'm gonna die!
 As if...
 I'd be scared!
 Made it just in time.
 Thanks!
 You keep getting in our way  over and over again.
 I'll kill you once and for all.
 Bring it on! I'll just keep throwing  your attacks right back at you!

 But the Queen of Witches is amazing.
 Scary, but get a good look  at her, and she's pretty.
 I guess older ladies can be charming, too.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The party headed to the Witches' Forest
 to break the curse that Vetto  had placed on Asta's arms,
 and they found Vanessa in a wretched state.
 Miz Vanessa!
 Vanessa!
 Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
 I don't know who you think you are,  but get your foot off of her right now!
 You must be the brat  Vanessa was talking about.
 This foolish little thing
 told me she'd become my slave and  live out the rest of her days here
 in exchange for healing your arms.

 In order to save Vanessa,
 the party began their battle with  the Queen of Witches, and then...
 They were much faster than I expected.
 New enemies arrived at the Witches' Forest.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.
 Witnessing how powerful the enemy was,
 the Queen of Witches healed Asta's arms
 and let him protect the forest.
 This is great! They're completely better!
 All right! Let's go, guys!
 Yeah!
 Because of the Queen of Witches's healing  magic, Asta's arms were better than ever.
 His battle with Fana, who was  filled with hatred, began.
 I'll kill you once and for all.
 Bring it on! I'll just keep throwing  your attacks right back at you!
 Flames of Hatred
 I'll just keep throwing your  attacks right back at you.
 Yeah.
 Over and over...
 Come at me as much as you want!
 I'll just keep throwing your attacks right  back at you over and over and over and over!
 Damn it, you bastard!
 I guess he's built up a lot of stress
 since he couldn't use his arms.
 I hate you...
 This time we'll...
 destroy you!
 Here they come!
 Flame Spirit Magic:
 Salamander's Talon.
 Wha—
 Seriously?!
 It's so powerful!
 So that's Salamander,
 said to have the highest attack  power of the Four Great Spirits.
 We're up against a spirit that matches  the military power of an entire nation...
 Amazing!
 Spirits are mana-based lifeforms.
 Asta's anti-magic sword can  slash apart mana itself!
 Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
 Man, that was scary! But it's so cool!
 Man, you're so lucky! I want a Salamander!
 Asta...
 But that old guy, Vetto, was much  faster and had better senses.
 We can do this!
 ...has a chance of winning this!
 Honestly... Watching you makes  being scared seem silly.
 Jeez... Why are these flames so powerful?
 It's like throwing water on burning rocks.
 I'm basically just wasting mana.
 I hope Asta and the others are okay.
 Why did you hurt us?
 I hate you.
 Okay, time for our counterattack!
 Yeah! Yeah...
 Hey, you! Let's sit down  and talk this through.
 Wha—
 What are you saying, Asta?!
 She's not someone you can just talk to!
 What's with all this hate business?
 What exactly do you hate so much?
 Would you mind telling me why you  hate the Clover Kingdom so much?
 How are we supposed to understand  each other when all we ever do is fight?
 Are you ready to talk?
 Shut up.
 What the heck are you doing?!
 Finral!
 You got it!
 Your friend also really hated us.
 The ones you broke...
 Our golden dreams and our bonds of blood!
 Despair!
 And... he was full of despair.
 Tell me why!
 Can't we just understand each other?
 Licht, is that person human?
 Yes. He's my friend.
 There's something strange about him.
 I believe that this will become
 a world where our peoples can  live side by side as friends.
 We'll be able to understand each other.
 Elves' mana is truly amazing.
 If we combine that with our techniques  in creating magical items,
 we'll be able to make this place  even more prosperous and safe.
 Let's do our best to live together.
 We wish you happiness!
 The mana is giving us its blessing.
 I'm so happy that our child will be welcomed  into this world with your blessings.
 This child is our future,
 the one who'll bring the  elves and humans together.
 The humans are attacking!
 Hey, wake up!
 My love...
 Why... Why?!
 Only that human knows where we live!
 He... He must've betrayed us!
 It can't be...
 This can't be!
 Who...
 Who would believe you?!
 This magic...
 Can you handle all of my hatred?
 She's got a third eye, too!
 Th-That thing just got bigger?!
 Asta!
 Asta!
 Not only did it get bigger, it's using  magic with different attributes?
 Come on, give us a break!
 Let the flames of my  hatred burn you to ashes!
 Damn it! In that case...
 I'll just have to bring out my special move!
 She's no ordinary mage.
 I just got a great idea!
 Now!
 It's so hot!
 The wave of hot air was  enough to blow me away.
 I won't be able to get closer to her alone.
 Miz Vanessa, Finral, are you guys all right?
 Somewhat. But...
 Her insane amount of magic is  creating a mana force field.
 I'm having a hard time manipulating space.
 The second I put my magic thread out, it gets burned.
 That magic power is ridiculous.
 Is this the power of spirits?
 It's like a god incarnate.
 Die!
 Damn it!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!
 What are you guys doing?!
 Noelle!
 I keep putting out the fires in  the forest, but there's no end to it!
 I guess I'll have to extinguish...
 Wh-What the heck is that thing? It's scary!
 L-Looks like I'll have to  extinguish the source first!
 Noelle uses water magic.
 And water can beat fire!
 It's evaporating...
 Fire Spirit Magic: Salamander's Talon!
 Hang on tight!
 Look out!
 Thanks!
 What the heck is that monster?
 But... I'm the one who uses water magic, so I have to do this.
 I can do this... I know I can do this!
 I can do this, I can do this, I can do this!
 You can't do it.
 You've been damaged goods  ever since you were born.
 Of course you can't do it.
 The only way you managed  to pull off the attack
 at the Water Temple is because  you let your rage take over.
 You're a failure.
 I really can't...
 You're strong!
 Noelle! You're strong!
 You can do this!
 I can't do anything about that flame!  I'm counting on you!
 Come on, come on, come on!  You can do anything if you have the guts!
 A-Asta!
 He's so loud. My ears are ringing.
 You hear me, Noelle?!
 You can figure anything out with guts!
 Asta?! You're a bit too loud!
 Hey, Finral! Why are you plugging your ears?
 Feel this wonderful breeze!
 You got this, Noelle?
 Yes.
 Get a grip, Noelle.  Just as Asta gave me courage...
 You can do it!
 You don't need to tell me!  I'll do it, Stupidsta!
 I'm going to give Asta courage, too!
 Here we go!
 It's going to fire.
 Right now, I'll probably only be  able to use Sea Dragon's Roar once.
 I'll bet everything
 on this one attack!
 I'm not a failure anymore!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 She dodged it?
 Disappear.
 Noelle!
 I'm not done yet!
 We did it!
 Wh-Whoa! That's our Noelle!
 I'm saved...
 I'll never forgive you.
 Did you see that, Asta? That's my true power!
 Y-Yay, I did it!
 Damn, that was awesome!
 That's my comrade! All right!
 Noelle's attack managed  to subdue the salamander.
 Now's our only chance!
 Next...
 It's your turn!
 It's my turn!
 All right! Now it's finally time  for my special move!
 I won't let you...
 Mineral Creation Magic: Harpe!
 Huh?!
 Why?! How is she able to use  magic besides flame magic?!
 That's so not fair!
 This spell...
 Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.
 And she can use recovery magic, too! Damn it!
 And this spell, too...
 I knew it!
 Hey, lady!
 You wouldn't happen to have a brother
 with a really pale face  and spiky hair, would you?
 He's over on the other side  of the forest right now!
 What are you talking about, Asta?!
 I don't know anyone like that!
 If I have any siblings, they're Licht  and the people of the village!
 Know their grudge against you!
 I'll massacre every last one of you!
 I can't get through to her at all!
 I'll just have to stop her with my  special move before she recovers!
 Hang on a sec, Asta! What's this  special move you keep talking about?
 Yeah, what is it?
 Glad you asked!
 You see, I'm gonna hold out  both swords in front of me
 and charge straight through  the air at super speed!
 I call it...
 How could you possibly do that?!
 Huh? I can't?!
 Not without us, you can't!
 You always come up with the craziest ideas.
 Let us help!
 Asta... Remember what I said earlier?
 Your friends are there to help you win  against a fate you can't defeat on your own!
 That attack of yours...
 will end up being incredibly powerful!
 Here we go!
 Too late!
 I won't let you kill anyone!

 He did it!
 All right!
 My special move was a complete success!
 No...

 when Fana of the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 another owner of a third eye,  suddenly appeared.
 She's got a third eye, too!
 I'll bet everything
 on this one attack!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Asta and the others were  helpless against the attacks
 of Fana's Salamander, the fire spirit,  as it tried to burn down the forest.
 But Noelle used a powerful  attack with her water magic
 and managed to subdue Salamander.
 All right! Now it's finally time  for my special move!
 In order to finish it off,
 Asta used Bull Thrust, a special  move he had just thought up.
 Here we go!
 Bull Thrust!
 Defectors' Atonement
 To think that imperfect little  brat had this much power...
 It seems he wasn't all talk.
 As for the other army...
 Who the heck is that guy?
 He's not a witch, is he?
 He had the balls to show up  alone in front of this huge army?
 Is he stupid?
 Mars! Do you know who I am?
 Wait, is that guy... our old teacher?
 Ladros...
 So I get to torment our old  teacher with my own hands.
 Heck yeah!
 Woo! Guess that's our teacher for you.
 It looks like neither of you  are who you used to be.
 Then I shall use my own magic...
 to atone for my past!
 Woo! What a nice breeze.
 It feels so nice!
 For the record, I have to ask...
 Do you have any intention of turning back?
 Oh, come on. That's our line, Teach!
 So, like... Apparently our  king is really sick, y'know?
 And from what we've heard, the queen  here has lived, like, hundreds of years.
 So the king wants to know how she does it,
 even if it means killing  everyone in this forest.
 We just happened to hear that  the Eye of the Midnight Sun was
 also visiting this forest,
 so we decided to take  advantage of the chaos!
 Taking what you want by force...  That's how the Diamond Kingdom works.
 And that's exactly why I left.
 Here I come!
 Yahoo! I get to embrace our  teacher with my own two—
 Tsk.
 He's charging at us despite  how many of us are here?
 Is this guy stupid?
 Wind Creation Magic: Emperor of  Slashing Winds—Winter Wind!
 What?
 He's fast!
 That's... the traitor, Fanzell Kruger!
 He was a military commander  and an instructor for our army.
 And he had the nerve to defect!
 If we kill him, we'll get a huge reward!
 Don't hold back! Kill him!
 As I thought, they're not moving.
 It must be hard to attack in a place  where your allies are concentrated.
 Particularly for warriors with  powerful magic like you two.
 But there are limits to how  much I can do by myself.
 I'm counting on you two, my little  honey and my cute little student.
 I wonder if Master actually  put some clothes on.
 Yup. I think I might actually be a genius.
 Keep calm! Get into Formation Six!
 Former commander or not,
 if we keep formation and continue  attacking from a distance,
 we'll eventually beat him.
 He's only one guy!
 What?!
 Of course he's not alone.
 ""To make a surprise attack, you must  have three times the enemy's strength.""
 That's what my master taught me.
 Reinforcements!
 Don't underestimate our strength!
 Team Two!
 They're... trying to drive us into the forest!
 This isn't good!
 The dense fog and trees  will ruin our formation.
 Change over to Formation Thirteen!
 Team Four!
 Team Five!
 How are they able to predict  our moves so easily?!
 It's because I was in the  Diamond Kingdom's assassination squad.
 You guys are too easy.
 Previously, I killed people who were  doing everything they could to survive.
 There might not be anything I can  do to atone for what I've done.
 This might just be self-satisfaction, but...
 I'll put an end to your tyranny.
 You traitor!
 Sure. You can say whatever you want.
 I won't lose heart again.
 If I did, the person who saved me  might get angry with me again.
 That girl's amazing!
 She's able to command us witches so well.
 I know, right? Our little  Mariella is amazing.
 And as for our next move...
 What are those things?
 They fell for it!
 I used my magic items and skills to  modify the golems just a tiny bit.
 Amazing! But the modifications  must've cost a fortune.
 Believe it or not, it only cost me  3,000 yuls in materials for each!
 That much destructive power  for a mere 3,000 yuls?!
 Okay, everyone! This is it!
 Time to teach those thugs who  thrashed our houses a lesson!
 Don't you dare underestimate us witches!
 Oh, dear... Looks like they set traps  down there and tried to lure us in.
 It wouldn't be safe to just charge in there.
 But on the other hand,  it looks fun, so here I go! Woo!
 Let me play, too!
 Now, then... where are they?
 I figured this is what you'd do.
 Wind Binding Magic: Emperor of  Slashing Winds—Whirlwind!
 Whoopsies! Looks like I've been caught.
 I'll ask you one more time.  Any chance of you turning back?
 Like hell I'm gonna turn back!
 I wanna kill lots and lots of people!
 What the hell's wrong with you, Teach?
 You're the one who raised murderers like us.
 And now you think you can live  your life as a good person?
 Sorry, but I promised my final student...
 and your junior apprentice.
 I'm going to live!
 I'm done running!
 Good. Make sure to sense  your opponent's mana.
 Calm your emotions.
 Good. Now concentrate.
 Listen up. Your powers  exist to protect others.
 Don't ever forget that.
 Yes, sir!
 Ladros was an expert in  physical reinforcement spells.
 This probably won't be enough to beat him.
 That's enough!
 Mars...
 He had the best skills of all my students.
 At this point, I don't think  I can beat him at close range.
 Let's have you step back a bit.
 Wind Creation Magic: Emperor of  Slashing Winds—Mountain Wind!
 Ladros...
 This is my full magic power!
 Wind Creation Magic: Emperor of Slashing Winds—
 Gale!
 Ladros was an odd kid who  didn't have a magic attribute.
 Teacher...
 You can become strong even  without an attribute, right?
 He had a complex about that.
 But his magic was stronger  than anyone else's.
 If he's picked up a powerful long-distance  spell, things are gonna get ugly.
 I'll put him out of commission first!
 Forgive me!
 I can't! I can't, I can't!
 I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't!
 Your magic...
 Teacher, I just...
 can't eat all of your magic!
 He doesn't have a single scratch on him!
 After you left, I had the  army surgically modify me,
 and I gained a certain magic ability...
 Absorption and emission.
 I can absorb all of the magic  attacks I take into my body
 and fire them back whenever I want.
 In other words...
 I can use your magic to kill your friends!
 What the heck is that magic?
 It's not just Ladros.  Several magic powers are building...
 Hey, Teach... Did you happen to bring  anyone important to you into this forest?
 If you did, you should probably  go save them right about now.
 Sweet! You can race with my magic!
 Here I go!
 Ready... and boom!
 Million Lasers!
 Whoops... I got so psyched up, I ended  up killing some of the people on our side.
 I wonder if Teach is still alive.
 Ooh, there he is!
 Zell...
 Domina...
 Oh, dear... It looks like you really did  have someone important to you here.
 But you seem to be taking a nap.  Probably not the best time for that!
 So you're Teach's special someone.
 Man, I'm jealous.
 Hey, I've seen you before.
 Oh! You're the girlfriend  who ran off with him!
 How've you been?
 Don't... You should be using your  powers to do the right thing...
 But I have been this whole time.
 I didn't go through special training to  protect people. Not even a tiny bit.
 Getting to use your power to the max in  combat... What could be better than that?
 You see, I want to be acknowledged.  By this country! By this world!
 That's why I trained hard and climbed to  the rank of the Eight Shining Generals.
 What is this idealistic crap  that's coming out of your mouth?
 That's exactly why you  lost a power struggle
 and had to run away with your  tail between your legs,
 you stupid coward!
 My husband... is not a coward!
 Guess I'll just have to kill this chick first!
 Don't!
 My powers... exist to protect others.
 Your lessons got through to me.
 Mars, what just...
 Mars, buddy... Whatcha doin'?
 There's no reason to kill  people unnecessarily.
 Our target is the Queen of Witches.
 How half-assed can you get?
 Those two are traitors that defected  from the Diamond Kingdom.
 Letting them go would mean  betraying our kingdom.
 You're right.
 So... you're gonna betray the kingdom?
 I guess that's what this means.
 Woohoo!
 I can finally kill you legally!
 Seeing you always drove me nuts!
 All cool and composed, even when we  were kids! You could do anything!
 I knew you were going to get in my  way as I was aiming for the top!
 Who knew I'd get to off you here?
 And along with your beloved teacher!
 This is the best! I couldn't ask for more!
 Mariella?
 That's my master you're talking about.
 Don't kill him like he's  just some sort of bonus!
 Could you and your weak  magic stay out of this?
 You wouldn't even count as a snack.
 That's my widdle Mars!
 I'll take your ridiculously huge magic, add in some flair, and send it right back atcha!
 Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe!
 Mars, why are you protecting us?
 As Ladros said, we're traitors.
 And you lost your memory...
 Don't worry. I'm on your side, Master.
 I wasn't expecting to see you here, but...
 Woohoo!
 The details can wait.
 We need to do something about him first.
 Right. But how are we supposed to  handle such an unnatural power?
 He's almost invincible, but there are  still a number of ways to defeat him.
 One is to feed him magic until it overwhelms  his capacity and he self-destructs.
 This might be possible with spirit magic  or even the Queen of Witches's magic.
 The other method...
 is anti-magic.
 Anti-magic?
 How do you know about that?
 There's actually someone who  can test out that method
 on the other side of the forest right now.
 Let's lure Ladros over there!
 Understood.
 What are you gossiping about over there?
 No matter what plan you come up with, it'll be useless against my power!
 What?
 Huh?
 Your power has made you careless!
 I'm not half bad at  reinforcement magic myself.
 Have a nice trip!
 We have you completely surrounded!
 So just give up already!
 Shoo, shoo! Shoo, shoo!
 Resistance is futile!
 We don't want to hurt you!
 You're still young! You shouldn't  just throw your life away!
 If you do something stupid, your parents  and friends back home will be sad!
 You filthy humans... Don't you  dare speak of my friends!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 You Got Through to Me
 You Got Through to Me.
 Mars!
 Do you... know how old I am?
 Twenty-eight.
 Woo! There's no way Teach is in his twenties!
 I say thirty-eight!
 No one can teach swordsmanship like that
 unless they've been teaching a long time.
 He's forty-two!
 I have absolutely no interest in this,  but he's probably forty-six.
 He has such a beautiful and intelligent  wife despite how he looks.
 The only way he could've  pulled that off is with
 flirting techniques acquired as a middle-aged man.
 Hm... Fifty!
 He always looks so tired, too... I say fifty-four.
 You are at least younger  than me... aren't you?
 I'm only twenty-eight...
 Your lessons got through to me!
 It appears that Salamander  is still alive and well.
 What will you do now, brat?
 Let's see what you're made of.

61,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The forces of the Eye of the Midnight  Sun attacked the Witches' Forest.
 They were after the magic stone  that lies in the forest.
 At the same time, the forces of the Diamond  Kingdom also attacked the Witches' Forest.
 They wanted to take advantage of the chaos
 and steal the Queen of Witches' secret.
 Fanzell, a former officer in  the Diamond Kingdom's army,
 ended up facing two of his  former students, Mars and Ladros.
 Million Lasers!
 Don't... You should be using your  powers to do the right thing...
 Getting to use your power to the max in  combat... What could be better than that?
 You see, I want to be acknowledged.  By this country! By this world!
 Guess I'll just have to kill this chick first!
 Don't!
 My powers... exist to protect others.
 Your lessons got through to me.
 Mars managed to turn the  tables at the last moment.
 Fanzell was troubled because
 he thought there was no way to defeat  Ladros's absorption and emission power,
 but he and Mars came up with a plan.
 What are you gossiping about over there?
 No matter what plan you come up with, it'll be useless against my power!
 I'm not half bad at  reinforcement magic myself.
 Have a nice trip!
 The Promised World
 We have you completely surrounded!
 So just give up already!
 If you do something stupid, your parents  and friends back home will be sad!
 You filthy humans... Don't you  dare speak of my friends!
 She still has that much magic left?!
 Oh, damn it!
 Those flames...
 There! They're right over there!
 This overwhelming amount of magic...
 It's Salamander!
 This magic...
 In that situation, Asta's not going  to have any time to deal with Ladros!
 No, wait a sec...
 Come on, Teach! Mars! Wait up!
 A little reinforcement magic  won't help you win against me!
 And you'll never win if  you keep running away!
 Here you go! Million Lasers!
 Asta!
 Old Man Zell!
 Wait, you're with the pale guy?!
 Asta!
 Deflect it over here!
 I don't know what's going on, but okay!
 I'll get us out of the way using the wind
 and aim the fire right at...
 Hey... This is way too big!
 Did it work?
 Ladros's magical powers disappeared.
 Hey! Old Man Zell!
 What the heck's going on here?! Something just fell!
 Well done, Asta.
 I see you've grown even stronger.
 Aw, shucks. It's nothing.
 No, wait! Why are you with the pale guy?!
 He's an enemy!
 Asta, was it?
 I am not your enemy. Trust me.
 How am I supposed to believe a  guy with an evil face like yours?!
 And my name is Mars, you shrimp.
 Wait, your mouth's nasty now, too!
 I'll explain everything later.
 Huh?
 For now, I'd like you to trust Mars.
 Well, if you say so.
 Thanks. Now, then...
 I think Ladros has been taken  care of for now, thanks to Asta.
 So we need to do something  about this monster.
 So that's the fire spirit Salamander  that I've heard so much about.
 It appears to be weakened, but it  still has tremendous magical powers.
 But those flames... They're the same as mine?
 And this magic itself feels like...
 Fa...na...
 We have no family...  so we have no other choice...
 But...
 Mars, is the training painful?
 N-No, it's not.
 When things get rough, remember the faces of those you love.
 We were born to protect the people  of this kingdom that we love so much.
 The faces of those you love...
 The face that popped into my  head immediately... was yours,
 Fana.
 Once we become strong enough  to protect this kingdom,
 we'll be allowed to go outside.
 You'll probably make it out first, Mars.
 Lucky.
 I mean, you're the strongest  out of all of us, Mars.
 I'll be waiting for you when that happens.
 Huh?
 Until you get out, too, Fana.
 Sure! Let's go see the  outside world together.
 This is your final test.
 Kill each other.
 The sole survivor will be allowed to go  outside as our kingdom's mage warrior.
 If you refuse, you'll all be disposed of.
 I'm sorry, Mars.
 Fana...
 I have no other choice.
 Please die.
 Why...
 Why?
 My wounds...
 If I didn't do that, you wouldn't have...
 tried to kill me...
 Make sure you go see the world outside.
 For me... as well.
 Fana!
 I thought I killed her with my own hands...
 But Fana's alive?!
 Fana!
 Hey!
 It's me! It's me!
 Don't you recognize me?
 H-H-Hey! Wait, wait, wait!
 You're going to die, die, die!
 Were you always like this?!
 Fana!
 You know each other?!
 Fana! Fana!
 He—
 Fana!
 Fana?
 My student Fana?
 After I left, I heard she died in  Morris's human experiments.
 Fana!
 I don't know you!
 Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
 It really is Fana...
 But is that transformation magic?
 No... there'd be no point in that.  Or there shouldn't be.
 That eye is emitting a strange power...
 Is it someone's spell?
 Is the Eye of the Midnight Sun  controlling Fana with that eye?
 What... is this? My head is...
 Fana!
 Why do all of you insist  on getting in my way?
 I hate you!
 That's...
 Gah! More self-destruct magic?!
 I'm taking you all down with me... No...
 I'll blow this whole temple to smithereens!
 Self-destruct?
 What's wrong with those people?!
 Do they all come with that option installed?!
 This isn't good! In a few minutes, this whole area's going to be blown away!
 Everything should just... disappear.
 Everything should just... disappear.
 Sea Dragon's Lair!
 Mars, no!
 What the hell are you doing?!
 Block it with your magic!
 Master, I have no right to block it!
 I killed Fana! I can't—
 This is seriously not the time for that!
 Are you stupid?! Do you wanna die?!
 I don't know the details,  but do you really know her?
 She's a leader in a terrorist group  called the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 Are you sure she's not just similar-looking?
 Dude, she's got three eyes!
 I would never mistake Fana!
 She's my precious childhood friend!
 Is that right?
 Then...
 If she's so important to you, now's really no time for you to be dying!
 Live and save her for real!
 You're right. I'm sorry.
 Were you always this up-front?
 Not only does Asta yell at me, but now he's yelling at you, his senior.
 It's all right, Mars.
 You'll be able to save her!
 Neither Finral's spatial magic nor my  thread magic work against those flames.
 And if we agitate it with Noelle's water  magic, it might explode immediately!
 I knew it. Only Asta's  anti-magic sword can stop it!
 All right, let's do this!
 Asta!
 When we fought the hairy gorilla...
 It's no use...
 You humans shall taste despair... Despair!
 My power couldn't stop him, but...
 Back then, I ended up killing her, but...
 This time...
 ...I'm not...
 ...letting anyone die!
 Stay away from me!
 Mineral Creation Magic: Laevateinn!
 They're both amazing!
 High-powered flame magic even  at that range isn't fazing them!
 Still, they have only a few minutes left.
 Will they make it in time?
 I'll charge in until she's in my sword's  range and dispel that self-destruct spell!
 This heat is insane!
 If we go any further,  we'll end up as charcoal!
 Asta?
 No, that's...
 You...
 Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.
 You good to go?
 Heck, yeah!
 So long as I don't turn into charcoal,  I can go as far as you want me to!
 This guy's amazing.
 After I fought him in the dungeon, I battled  against many other skilled fighters,
 Not yet! I'm not done yet!
 but I've never met anyone  who's this bad at giving up.
 And... he's also strange.
 Even now, he's still not sure whether I'm friend or foe, but he's still talking to me
 and trying to help.
 I've fought many of the Magic Knights,
 but no one has tried as hard to  protect and help people as he does.
 He embodies the title in the  truest sense of the term.
 He is...
 a real knight!
 Hey, are you all right?
 I'm fine!
 This pain can't even begin  to compare to Fana's!
 This guy's completely different  from when I first fought him.
 He was like a killer doll back then. I didn't know he had such warm feelings.
 Enormous, polished power,
 and an unbreakable determination  to save someone...
 Right now, he's indestructible!
 It's going to blow any second now!
 You guys should evacuate!
 They believe in their friend  and refuse to move.
 I'll believe in those two as well,  and see this through.
 Go forth, my students.
 You can do this!
 Just...
 ...a little more.
 Fana!
 It's all over.
 No... Not yet!
 I won't let it end!
 H-He did it!
 Ack! Hot, hot, hot! Hot, hot, hot!
 It's gone.
 It is not gone.
 Our hatred will never go away!
 Not—
 Fana, it's me! It's me!
 I'm really, truly sorry!
 Back then, I didn't have the  strength to fight alongside you!
 Please forgive me!
 You're a girl, Fana. You shouldn't  push yourself too hard.
 I'll be waiting for you when that happens.
 Until you get out, too, Fana.
 Why... Why?!
 Only that human knows where we live!
 He... He must've betrayed us!
 We've met in the outside world,
 but nothing's started yet!
 Let's...
 Let's go see the  outside world together.
 Let's go see the world together!
 Okay.
 It's a promise, Mars.
 Yeah, Fana.
 Mars?
 Oh, goodness.
 What a relief.
 I'm so jealous!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Leave It to Mars
 Leave It to Mars.
 Hey, Mars. Tell me what happened after  you defeated me all those years ago.
 Ow!
 I'm sorry I defeated you.
 Ahem...
 Ta-da! Look at this grimoire!
 Wait, is half of this mine?
 Yes! It's a grimoire with your powers in it!
 I can feel you all the time!
 Wow... That's a little scary.
 Ow!
 Th-The mage scholar Morris made this!
 I was brainwashed by Morris. They modified my body,
 and I fought as I was commanded.
 But then I regained my memories  after fighting Asta.
 And ever since, Fana,
 I've been saving lives in secret between  missions as my way of atoning to you!
 I'm a good boy, right?
 Yes, you're a very good boy.
 You may have defeated me,  but you're a good boy.
 Ow!
 I'm so jealous... No, envious!
 No, no. I'm older here, so I  have to act like I don't care.
 I am older than Mars, right?
 Congratulations, Mars and Fana. I wish you happiness.

62,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun  arrived at the Witches' Forest,
 searching for a magic stone.
 Wanting to take advantage of  the chaos they were causing,
 the Diamond Kingdom came to steal  the Queen of Witches' secret.
 Million Lasers!
 Guess I'll just have to kill this chick first!
 Don't!
 Your lessons got through to me.
 Fanzell's former student Mars, who was  still in the Diamond Kingdom's army,
 decided he would side with him.
 Why are you protecting us?
 As Ladros said, we're traitors.
 And you lost your memory...
 Don't worry. I'm on your side, Master.
 Deflect it over here!
 I don't know what's going on, but okay!
 By taking advantage of Asta's anti-magic,  they successfully defeated Ladros.
 But the moment they tried to finish off Fana of the Eye of the Midnight Sun's Third Eye,
 who was weakened by Noelle's spell...
 Fana!
 It's me! It's me!
 Don't you recognize me?
 My student Fana?
 Fana, who had lost her memories,
 fell into a deeper state of confusion  and tried to self-destruct, but...
 Everything should just... disappear.
 Asta and Mars risked their lives to stop her.
 Let's go see the world together!
 Okay.
 It's a promise, Mars.
 Fana regained her memories.
 Those Who Boost Each Other Up
 All right!
 Asta.
 I couldn't have done it without you.
 Thank you.
 There is no reason for the weak  to stand on the battlefield.
 I was born to break people like you.
 You're in my way...
 Begone!
 The weak will perish,  and only the strong will remain.
 Someone as naïve as you  cannot win against me!
 That was all your strength!
 I'm glad you were able to  save your childhood friend!
 Is he your friend, Mars?
 Wow! So you made a friend  in the outside world!
 No, I wouldn't say he's—
 Yeah, he's totally my friend!  We did fight once, though.
 Ow...
 So hard!
 I'm glad you calmed down, too.
 But what the heck happened?
 You stupid dummy! Why do you have to do  such drastic things every single time?!
 Were you born just to try to kill yourself?!
 You barely have any clothes on!
 You're a magnificent student.
 Thank you, Master.
 Master Fanzell!
 Your powers exist to protect others.
 Don't ever forget that.
 Yes, sir!
 I'm so glad you're both alive.
 So you barely remember anything?
 Yes.
 After the final training, I...
 I can hardly believe she's  started breathing again.
 Is this the power of the magic that bears  the Phoenix's name? Or could it be...
 How fascinating.
 We'll fit Fana with a mage stone, too.
 What a disappointment.
 Not only did it fail to increase her  magic, but she hardly has any left.
 I guess that was the last dying ember of it.
 Get rid of her. She's of  no interest to me anymore.
 You poor thing.
 My old friend...
 It's just as it was long ago.
 Humans even hurt other humans.
 As you wish, I shall destroy them.
 But... I need your body.
 You will live on!
 I don't have any memories after that.
 It felt as though someone  else entered my body.
 Like I was being controlled...
 All I remember is that  person's fierce hatred.
 What about the third eye  and pointy ears you had?
 I'm really sorry.  I don't know anything about them.
 You went through all that?
 I had no idea, and I...
 Mars, you don't need to  feel bad about anything.
 I mean, we got to meet again.
 Right. I'll never let you go again.
 Yeah... Let's stay together forever.
 Y-Yeah...
 My, my! Aren't things heating up over there?
 He's stiffened up as hard as a  chunk of ore. How adorable.
 Childhood friends tragically torn  apart and reunited by destiny...
 That's really great!
 Whoa, he's bawling over there!
 What's the matter, Finral?
 I'm jealous and envious and bummed out!
 Huh? You don't have any childhood friends?
 No! I don't have any cute  childhood friends like that!
 Nope! Nope! Nope! Not one, damn it!
 I have childhood friends!
 Lots of them, actually!
 Just so you know, I'm not jealous!
 Why'd I just get slapped?!
 I'm royalty!
 Anyway, why did the Eye of the  Midnight Sun come to the Witches' Forest?
 I still feel a strong desire in my head  to retrieve the magic stone.
 Magic stone?
 So that means there's a  magic stone in this forest?
 Let's hurry and go see the Queen of Witches!
 No, before that, we need to save Domina,  Mariella, and the wounded witches.
 What is this ki?
 Impossible! His magical power should be gone...
 Everyone, run!
 Man, that was some intense magic.
 It took forever to absorb it all.  Thanks for the meal!
 I must admit, I thought I was going to die.
 Ladros... But your magic  power should've been depleted.
 I emitted it all, and then took it back in.
 You rely too much on your  magic detection, Teach.
 Really, though, why do all of you
 keep putting your own lives  in danger to protect others?
 M-Mars...
 That's exactly why I'm  gonna end up killing you!
 Well, well, some weirdo just showed up.
 This doesn't concern you, so could you get lost?
 It's got lots to do with me!
 He's my...
 friend!
 Why do all of you
 keep putting your own lives  in danger to protect others?
 M-Mars...
 That's exactly why I'm  gonna end up killing you!
 Well, well, some weirdo just showed up.
 This doesn't concern you, so could you get lost?
 It's got lots to do with me!
 He's my...
 friend!
 Asta...
 Mars!
 I need to use a recovery spell!
 I can't cast anything?
 What happened to my body? Is my magic gone?
 Just hang on! I'm gonna pound this guy!
 Whoa, wait a sec! You're that one guy, right?
 The anti-magic knight or whatever.
 I totally feel your pain, man.
 I was born without a magic attribute myself.
 Even when I was a kid, everybody made  fun of me and called me bland.
 But hey, you're even more worthless than me.
 What'd you say, you bastard?!
 I kinda feel bad for you.
 Give me some of your magic, then!
 I would if I could.
 Oh, I know.
 Here. All yours if you can reach.
 What a great reaction! I think  we'd make great partners.
 Wanna team up?
 You can be my right-hand man.
 I'll talk to the Diamond Army for you.
 Let's rise up through the  royal army's ranks together!
 We'll teach the guys who get all cocky  just because they've got talent a lesson!
 Just kidding. I'm gonna make his  anti-magic powers all mine, too!
 I refuse.
 Huh?
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King  of the Clover Kingdom!
 Wizard King? Seriously?
 This is why I hate idiots! Million Lasers!
 I heard about how you fight.
 Without that spatial magic guy over there,
 you can't do a thing about  long-distance spells, can you?
 You make the perfect target!
 That ricochet trick won't work on me, either.
 Recycle, recycle!
 There's no way you can win! Just give up!
 Who's gonna give up?
 You hurt my friends.
 And you won't get away with that!
 Friends?
 There's no such thing.
 There are only two kinds of people  in this world: the users and the used.
 I won my way to the top by  using the people around me.
 I'm gonna use Mars over there
 and the girl next to him to  get myself even further ahead.
 Maybe I'll let the military use them  for magic research until they die!
 What's the matter? You're not  letting me get away with this, right?
 You can be my stepping stone, too!
 Huh?
 What is this?
 N-Not good! My magic's draining away!
 I-It won't come out!
 Huh? Wait... You're kidding me!
 From this? Really?
 Crap! Everything I've worked for...
 Crap! All I did was take my  eyes off of him for a second!
 I'd made it to the rank of  the Eight Shining Generals!
 This is bad! Bad! Bad!
 No way! No way! No way!
 Did he really just throw this stupidly  heavy sword all the way up there?!
 What kind of decision was that?
 What the hell were you thinking?!
 Shit! Shit! This is crazy!
 Are you telling me I'm gonna be  taken out by a dumbass attack like this?
 Damn it! Stay back! Stay away!
 I couldn't have made it this far on my own.
 People taught me how to use  my power and how to fight.
 We got through life or death  situations together.
 We helped each other out  while improving how we fight.
 The reason I've been able  to react to the attacks
 is because of something called ""ki""  from back in my homeland.
 Ki?
 Where I come from, we've got this saying...
 ""A warrior never goes back on his word.""
 You said you were going to  become the Wizard King, didn't you?
 Surpass your limits. Right here, right now.
 There's no other way.
 Yes, sir!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Cradle!
 What are you guys doing?!
 Noelle!
 I'll bet everything
 on this one attack!
 I'm not a failure anymore!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 We did it!
 Let us help!
 Here we go!
 That attack of yours...
 will end up being incredibly powerful!
 Too late!
 I won't let you kill anyone!
 Bull Thrust!
 He did it!
 All right!
 My special move was a complete success!
 Friends are only meant to be used?
 Not my friends! My friends and I...
 We boost each other up!
 I-I was wrong!
 I'll stop hurting people! Please spare me!
 Please! Take out this sword!
 I can't get it out on my own!
 No!
 Huh?
 I know how strong you are, so I'm not gonna get careless!
 If I take it out and you attack me, I have no chance of winning!
 Besides, if I'd missed when I  threw it at you, I would've lost!
 I'm an idiot, so I can't afford  to mess up to begin with!
 No, please... I-I'm begging you!
 If it doesn't come out, I'm gonna die!
 That's not enough to kill anybody!
 I missed your vital points on purpose!
 Damn it! I thought I'd be able  to trick an idiot like him if I
 tugged at his heartstrings,  but he's not buying it!
 Shit! Shit! Shit!
 This twerp's been through  his share of battles!
 So I'm gonna whack you  again and knock you out!
 Damn it all!
 This is all of my remaining magic.
 If I attack him and he blocks it, I'm really finished!
 I'll just have to use reinforcement  magic and force it out!
 Ow!
 I've got enough left for two magic bullets...
 That bastard!
 You're Fana, right?
 Ladros!
 I don't know how you got those powers,
 but use that huge magic of yours right now!
 Huh? Huge magic? What are you talking about?
 Quit playing dumb, and hurry it up!
 Do it or I'll kill...
 him!
 Mars!
 The next shot will really kill him.
 Stop!
 And there it is!
 Okay, then...
 Time for the ultimate gamble!
 This magic's insane!
 I feel like my body's gonna burst!
 This is the greatest magic I've ever eaten.
 Impossible! This power  surpasses the spirit's!
 It's not an amount a human can emit!
 Ladros, you...
 You bastard!
 Payback time.
 I tracked it with ki, but it was still  so fast that I couldn't dodge it.
 I've obtained the ultimate power!
 If I use this, the other Eight Shining  Generals don't stand a chance!
 Forget them! I can take  over the whole kingdom!
 Woohoo!
 I'll murder everyone who  ever looked down on me!
 But before that, I guess  I'd better finish you off.
 I won't get careless again.
 I'll keep hitting you with ranged  attacks that you can't block...
 until you're in pieces!
 Asta!
 He's turned the tables.
 Since he can use that sword, I thought  he might be their descendant, but...
 Show me who you really are!
 Now, then, how many more shots can  that body you're so proud of take?
 Huh?
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 How Does It Taste?
 How Does It Taste?
 This is the greatest magic I've ever eaten.
 Take that!
 Ah, that tastes very regal.
 That's royalty for you.
 Take that!
 Ah, yes. Yours tastes a little mature.
 Take that!
 This tastes really nostalgic.
 Ladros!
 It tastes like pickles!
 So you're saying that not only do I look  old, but my magic tastes old, too?!
 You got it, Teach!
 Tee-hee!
 Queen of Witches, what did you do to Asta?!
 Asta's grimoire is giving off an eerie light.
 You almost look like... a demon!

63,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 He's turned the tables.
 Since he can use that sword, I thought  he might be their descendant, but...
 Show me who you really are!
 Not in the Slightest
 Huh?
 What is this place?
 Wait, does this mean...
 that I di—
 Hey... No way.
 I haven't married Sister yet.
 And besides...
 Damn...
 it...
 Heya.
 Welcome.
 Who the hell are you?!
 Well, that's cold.
 I've been the one closest  to you this whole time.
 Nope! I definitely don't know anyone like you!
 Well, whatever.
 Regardless, this is a chance for  me to obtain a physical body.
 So I'll be taking yours.
 Hey! What's the big idea?!
 Oh, come on. It's not a bad deal.
 You wanna win, right?
 Against that human.
 I can make that happen for you.
 Shut up! I'm gonna defeat  him with my own strength!
 Quit yappin' and let me take  over your consciousness!
 All you've got to do is pass out.
 A little dwarf like you  has no chance of winning.
 Don't you dare underestimate dwarfs!
 Thanks for looking down on me from  all the way up there, you big lug!
 Because of that, I can look  up as I run to the top!
 There are places that you just can't climb.
 Come on, just give up.
 You can't do a thing in this world.  Just give up on everything.
 You were born a loser!
 Give... up?
 That one time was the very last time
 I'm ever going to feel depressed!
 Never giving up...
 is my magic!
 What the?
 He got back up instantly...
 The three leaves of the clover  represent faith, hope, and love.
 Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.
 Within a fifth leaf...
 resides a demon.
 This... doesn't feel like magic?
 Asta?
 What happened to you?
 That's quite the transformation.
 But what exactly are you going to do with it?!
 Well, it looks like you're a bit faster now,
 but let's see how long you can keep that up!
 Did you really think I'd fall  for the same thing twice?!
 This isn't a slight change.
 Where's all this strength coming from?!
 Damn you!
 Now you won't be able to dodge anymore.
 Huh?
 Whoa, there!
 What is this?
 It feels like I'm in a cold lake.
 It feels cool...
 My mind is unbelievably clear.
 And I can feel...
 the power overflowing!
 I thought he'd lose consciousness,  but it seems he was able to control it.
 Anti-magic energy flows constantly  through the Demon-Dweller Sword,
 draining the wielder's magic.
 As such, no one should be able to wield it.
 But since you are magicless, that power flows through you.
 You've been unconsciously emitting  and shutting off that power.
 Using the power of my blood, which I transfused during your treatment,
 I accelerated the flow of power and removed the limits on its output.
 The anti-magic power will  now become a raging torrent,
 and you will become its vessel.
 What... the hell?
 I assumed that you might be one of their kin,
 but apparently I was wrong.
 What is this feeling?
 A sudden mutation kept  mana from dwelling in you.
 You're merely defective.
 But because of that, you are able to wield that sword.
 What the hell are you?
 You aren't special. Not in the slightest.
 But that's exactly what makes you special.
 Get out of my sight!
 In your presence, all magic is meaningless.
 So finish him.
 Damn it!
 Why?!
 My magic's supposed to be invincible now!
 Stay back!
 Get away from me! Stay away!
 It's no use.
 The flood of anti-magic homes in on mana.
 A black shooting star... climbing into the sky?
 Shit!
 Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Shit!
 Why?!
 I got this far by kicking everyone else down!
 Why are you...
 You might've kicked people down,
 but everyone that helped boost me up
 makes me strong!
 Black Meteorite!
 All the magic in my body is gone.
 This can't happen to me... Not here...
 I guess maybe... this really is my limit.
 Lad...ros...
 Asta...
 He's so powerful...
 The way he fought didn't  seem like Asta at all.
 And the way he looks...
 It's almost as if...
 Kill me. I'm ready.
 Like hell I'd kill you!
 Right now, I'm gonna go rescue all the people you hurt!
 Hurry up and heal so you can come help me!
 Then you can apologize to them all!
 You're all wrinkly and bloody now, but I'm  not letting you off the hook, you jerk!
 What the hell?! Are you okay?
 Yeah... I can't beat that.
 I feel much better now.
 Uh, did your personality just change?
 Well, the mage stones broke,  so my head feels a bit lighter.
 Good grief...
 You sure you're okay?
 I guess it's guys like you  that climb to the top.
 You sure you didn't go crazy?
 If I'd been with you...
 We might've been able to help  each other get stronger, too.
 Asta, thank you.
 Hey, did you fall asleep?
 Hey, come on! Are you listening to me?
 I guess I was worried for nothing.
 He's still himself.
 I'm back to normal.
 What was that black stuff, anyway?
 And I feel like I fought  something in my dream.
 But it felt like I was able to use some  mysterious power, and that was super exciting!
 I wanna master it!
 I wonder if this is what it feels  like when everyone else uses magic.
 I hurt all over!
 I'm bleeding so much!
 Oh, crap! I'm dying!
 Someone save me!
 What do you want?
 Sorry...
 No one's okay at all!
 Hey, you two! You guys can  use recovery magic, right?!
 Do something—Wait,  are you guys even alive?!
 Oh, good! You're alive!
 But you're totally not waking up!
 Sorry, Mars. Am I too heavy?
 No... You're actually kind  of warm, and it feels nice.
 You've seriously changed, dude!
 Oh, Mars...
 You're ignoring me?!
 Damn it! I'm gonna have  to carry you all with me!
 I'll make as many trips as  I need to make! Bring it!
 There's no need for that.
 The Queen of Witches!
 The Queen...
 We took down the Eye of the Midnight Sun  and the guys from the Diamond Kingdom!
 That means I paid you back  for fixing my arms!
 I didn't even need to go into battle.
 It was far from perfect,  but well done nonetheless.
 Nah, it was nothing!
 Oh, hey, so...
 While we're at it...
 Do you think maybe you  could heal everyone here?
 Ah...
 That won't be necessary.
 What... is thi—
 Noelle!
 Blood Creation Magic:  Fresh Blood Execution Ground.
 I'm sure Master and the others are fine.
 You're right.
 Such an ominous magical power...
 You just showed up outta nowhere,  and now what the hell are you do—
 Controlling blood. That is my magic.
 Ever since I cast that spell on you,
 I've been able to manipulate  your blood as I please.
 I am a queen.
 Why would I bother granting  a wish for the likes of you?
 You are the one who will bend to my will.
 Blood Magic: Puppet's Blood.
 Asta!
 That being said, I can't have you die on me.
 I shall heal you, at least.
 Blood Recovery Magic:  Curse-Breaking Blood-Filled Cocoon.
 Stay with me, and you can  rampage all you like.
 She's using one high-level  spell after another!
 It's bone-chilling. This is somehow even  more terrifying than the spirits' magic!
 So this is the Queen of Witches!
 If I cannot hold the anti-magic  sword in my own hand,
 I just need to control someone who can.
 I've observed how you use it.
 From now on, you'll spend your life  in my employ, working as my blade.
 Th...
 This can't be...
 The Queen was after the anti-magic  sword this whole time?!
 Now, for your first task...
 I shall force you to kill everyone  here with your own two hands.
 Kill every last one of them perfectly.
 No... way...
 So the Queen of Witches was after  Asta's anti-magic all along.
 This magic... I didn't get this  old just for show, y'know!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Show me who you really are!
 Never giving up...

 The Queen of Witches released Asta's  limiter suppressing his anti-magic
 and awakened his full powers.
 What is this?
 It feels like I'm in a cold lake.
 It feels cool...
 My mind is unbelievably clear.

 Asta was able to defeat Ladros,  thanks to this newly awakened power,
 and Ladros turned over a new leaf.
 However...
 Controlling blood. That is my magic.
 From now on, you'll spend your life  in my employ, working as my blade.
 The Queen of Witches was after  Asta's anti-magic all along.
 She then took control of Asta...
 Now, for your first task...
 I shall force you to kill everyone  here with your own two hands.
 The Red Thread of Fate
 No... way...
 Asta, stop!
 Asta!
 Now, then... Which one of you shall I kill first?
 I know.
 I'll start with you, little royal.
 Go.
 Stop!
 No! Wake up!
 Snap out of it, Asta!
 It's no use. He can't hear us.
 Asta, stop! Don't you recognize me?
 It must be fate...
 To think that a royal of the  Clover Kingdom shall die by his sword.
 Asta...
 Asta...
 Wake up!
 Asta...
 This is farewell.
 No!
 Asta, don't!
 Do it.
 This boy... He's unconscious, and yet...
 Asta...
 So he's not completely under her control.
 I won't let you kill me.
 I'm not going to let you kill me!
 Just you wait!
 I'll shake this flimsy spell  off right this instant!
 These stupid things!
 Puppet's Blood binds itself with the  blood in your body and takes hold.
 No matter how much you struggle,  you will never undo it.
 That goes for you as well,  even if you don't have any magic.
 Asta...
 You sre stubborn. However...
 Asta!
 Please! Make him stop!
 I swear that I'll never  leave this forest again!
 I'll never disobey you again... So please...
 No.
 I will kill them here, perfectly,
 to keep you from having any  more foolish notions ever again.
 My divinations told me, ""Vanessa will summon what you want
 and return to the forest alive someday.""
 That is why I didn't  search very hard for you.
 Granted, I didn't think that what I wanted  would be a human with anti-magic swords.
 But what did you gain by going outside?
 You formed trivial bonds with  imperfect fools, and as a result,
 you only brought about their deaths.
 You cannot escape me.
 You cannot sever this bond.
 Bond?
 After all, you are my daughter. My family.
 I'm... part of your family?
 You belong to me.
 No way!
 No, really!
 Oh, yeah! That town had  really delicious cake.
 I want to go, too.
 Hey, please! Help me!
 I want to leave!
 Hey, please! Please, don't go!
 Vanessa.
 Your Majesty...
 Please let me out of here!  I don't want to be in here anymore!
 I'm so lonely all by myself!  How long do I have to stay in here?
 Your Majesty!
 This thread magic doesn't have the sort  of incredible power you say it does!
 Please, let me out of here!
 No. You will one day have the  power to control destiny.
 It clearly says so in my divinations.
 But—
 You asked how long you must stay in there, and I shall give you an answer.
 I won't let you out of there
 until you invoke the magic that  allows you to control destiny.
 You are my family.
 If I'm your family, let me out of here!
 I cannot do that.
 I will be the one to choose your destiny.
 Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
 Please, wait! Please let me out of here!
 I don't have... powers like that.
 Oh, yeah. That cake shop  ended up closing down.
 That's a shame.
 Hey, did you know?
 There's a big town outside this forest,
 and there are a lot of people  who aren't witches living there.
 Vanessa... We've heard that  story hundreds of times.
 All the other witches go  there to have fun, right?
 Some even have boyfriends.
 Why don't you escape from this  cage and go out there, too?
 What? B-But I can't...
 I mean...
 I can't defy the Queen of Witches.
 C-Come on, cheer up.
 Do you want me to ask the  Queen of Witches for you?
 That's impossible. You're a doll  that I created with my own magic.
 If I can't do it, neither can you.
 You have a point.
 This whole conversation is just you  talking to yourself to begin with.
 Hopefully you'll be able to  make some real friends someday.
 That's impossible... There's no way.
 I'm going to be stuck like this  forever... I'll never be free.
 It seems a bit noisy outside...
 There's a man!
 Intruder!
 Intruder?
 Jeez... Come on now. I'm just  doing some warrior training.
 A man?
 Why am I being chased around this  forest just for being a guy?
 I've never seen one before. A man...
 And that hysterical old hag  is a tough cookie, damn it.
 He fought the Queen?
 What the hell is this place, anyway?
 Huh? Who're you? What are you  doing in a place like this?
 U-Um, w-well, you see...
 The Queen has me locked up in here.
 You're locked up in here?
 So you're literally like a bird in a cage.
 I've never been outside.
 Seriously? Well, that sucks.
 But, hey. You're in luck.
 There's a huge hole in it now,  so you can get out that way.
 I-I can't! I'll never be  able to escape the Queen.
 I'm fated to stay here.
 Huh? ""I'm fated to stay here""?
 Oh, right. Good ol' Mr. Fate.
 I hate that bastard.
 Like hell I'm gonna listen to 'im.
 I'll do what I want, even if  I have to crush fate myself.
 I'm pretty sure I can't beat that  hysterical old hag right now, though.
 So I'm getting the hell outta here.
 See ya, little birdie.
 W-Wait! What should I do?
 Hell if I know. Choose for yourself.
 I'm a bird trapped in a cage...
 Which means that I should have wings.
 I can fly through that big, blue sky.
 I will choose...
 for myself!
 What I obtained in the outside world was...
 No, it's not you.
 What?
 You're not my family!
 The Black Bulls are!
 And right now, that family is about to  be taken from me, right before my eyes!
 If I can't stop this, why do I even exist?!
 Please! If I truly have this power...
 My magic, I implore you...
 Change destiny!
 What is this?
 The red thread... of fate.
 Is that what this is?
 I didn't visualize it taking this shape.
 Why?
 Did she finally discover  the power to control fate?
 Well, then... Let us find out.
 No!
 It only touched him?
 Nothing is happening?
 Rue your sin in having underestimated  the Queen of Witches.
 No!
 So it was still incomplete.
 But have no fear.
 I am perfection, and I shall ensure that it is fostered properly under my supervision.
 No!
 What?
 What in the world? I could've sworn  that he cut down the royal girl.
 Rue your sin in having underestimated  the Queen of Witches.
 Didn't I just speak those  words a few moments ago?
 What?
 Was there some kind of mistake?
 Stop!
 It's over.
 Stop!
 This... It cannot be...
 Then how about him?
 Then how about the cat itself?
 Puppet's Blood has come undone?
 Are you telling me my manipulation failed?
 This... This truly is the  power to control destiny.
 In all likelihood, this magic changes
 the destinies of the people the cat  touches to the caster's advantage.
 Vanessa herself probably didn't see the  fates where her companions were killed.
 She's only seeing the attacks  continue to miss against all odds.
 This cat is both harmless and unavoidable.
 So you've awakened. Well done, Vanessa.
 I've been waiting for this moment.
 I've waited so, so long.
 Blood Magic: Puppet's Blood!
 Vanessa!
 Now both you and your magic belong to me.
 That power best suits  me because I am perfect.
 Now, fate, align yourself with me!
 What was...
 What just happened?
 Darling!
 Domina! Mariella!
 You're safe...
 Impossible...
 Impossible. Impossible!
 There's nothing that my  perfect magic cannot control!
 So why?
 So this is the power to control destiny  that you were talking about.
 I don't know much about this power yet,
 but there is one thing I do know.
 This magic only takes the side of myself  and those I have a family bond with.
 You and I have no bond.

 Vanessa Saw...!
 Vanessa Saw...!
 Oh, my lovely princess, please marry me.
 Oh, my prince! I'm so happy!
 Do you really choose me?
 Yes, it has to be you. You're almost  as beautiful as the Queen of Witches!
 Oh, I could never compare to her!
 The Queen of Witches is so beautiful,  kind, and beloved by all!
 No, you truly are.
 You're so elegant, kind, and proud,  just like the great Queen of Witches.
 Oh, I'm so happy, my prince!
 Oh, my princess.
 Man, it's so quiet around here  without those knuckleheads around.

65,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Controlling blood. That is my magic.
 Ever since I cast that spell on you,
 I've been able to manipulate  your blood as I please.
 Now, for your first task...
 I shall force you to kill everyone  here with your own two hands.
 Kill every last one of them perfectly.
 Asta fell under the Queen of Witches'  control and tried to kill his friends, but...
 Please! Make him stop!
 No.
 You cannot escape me.
 After all, you are my daughter. My family.
 I'm... part of your family?
 You're not my family!
 The Black Bulls are!
 A new spell activated, arising from  Vanessa's strong love for her friends.
 The red thread... of fate.
 Puppet's Blood has come undone?
 This magic only takes the side of myself  and those I have a family bond with.
 You and I have no bond.
 I'm Home
 You and I have no bond.
 Impossible...
 Your Majesty, look!  I made a doll out of thread!
 My, it's so well-made.
 I want to make everyone smile with my magic!
 I'm sure you'll be able to, Vanessa.
 I obsessed so much over obtaining perfection
 that I forgot something important.
 There is a power you can obtain from  your feelings because you're imperfect.
 The magic you could not obtain under my care...
 It came to you only because  you were free and imperfect.
 Perfect.
 Do as you wish.
 You have utterly defeated me.
 Blood Recovery Magic: Curse-Breaking Blood-Filled Cocoon.
 Ow!
 My wounds have healed!
 Huh?
 She fully healed all of us.
 The Queen of Witches really is insane.
 We... won?
 You're amazing, Vanessa!
 We won... We won because of your magic!
 Whoo!
 Thank goodness.
 I'm so glad you're okay!
 Do you know how worried I was about you?
 Ow, ow, ow, ow...
 I see you're naked, as usual.
 Huh? When did that happen?
 It's been a while, you two.
 It's good to see you.
 Why, you little...
 It's all thanks to you, Vanessa.
 No.
 It's thanks to all of you.
 It's because all of you were there for  me that I was able to use that spell.
 Thank you.
 I guess so.
 Huh?
 Woohoo! It doesn't hurt!
 It doesn't hurt at all! Actually,  I feel as light as a feather!
 The moment he gets back on his feet...
 Talk about energetic.
 Hey, Stupidsta! You're practically naked!
 You're bringing that up now?!
 Maybe he took after you, Master.
 What?
 But just look at me now, Noelle!
 As soon as I was healed, I felt like  my muscles were even more powerful!
 Stupidsta!
 This bird...
 Thank goodness those violent  people finally left.
 That's what they get for  attacking the Witches' Forest!
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun
 was apparently looking for a  magic stone that's in this forest.
 Do you know anything about that?
 I would assume the magic  stone you speak of is this.
 I have no need of it. You may have it.
 Huh? The magic stone?
 Whoa, thank you!
 Holy crap! We got the  magic stone just that easily!
 Yami's gonna praise us for this!
 Hey, it seemed like the Eye of  the Midnight Sun wanted this.
 Do you have any idea why?
 Actually, who the heck are they, anyway?
 Do you know anything about them?
 That magic stone is a magical item  that heightens the wearer's powers,
 but only those of the elf tribe  are truly able to use it.
 Elves?
 The elves possessed great power.
 They lived in what is now called the  Forsaken Realm several centuries ago.
 Each individual elf had an extraordinary  amount of magical power.
 Many of them were equal to me.
 Several centuries? Lady, how old are you?
 Your skin is way too flawless.
 But...
 The humans outnumbered them, and when  they fought them, the elves were annihilated.
 That Fana girl's third eye...
 That is forbidden magic.
 But that girl wasn't the one who  activated that spell. It was someone else.
 Ordinary humans are unable to  meddle with forbidden magic.
 I-I'm so completely lost.
 Activating a forbidden spell
 requires a tremendous amount of  mana and some sort of sacrifice.
 The ancient demon was also  a top-level forbidden spell
 activated by the leader of the elf clan.
 That demon?
 It could be that the Eye of the Midnight Sun are descendants of the elves.
 It couldn't be.
 Are you telling me the evil  monsters from the picture book
 my nanny read to me as a  child were actually elves?
 Holy crap! We're getting a  ton of amazing new intel!
 Reporting! I'm gonna  become a reporting fiend!
 And Asta, the two swords you bear...
 They are the ruined remains of the  magic swords used by the elves' leader.
 What does that mean?!
 Asta's head exploded because he couldn't  keep up with the conversation!
 Get a hold of yourself, Stupidsta!
 He can't! He's too dumb to  handle any more of this!
 If you continue to fight them, that mystery  should also be resolved eventually.
 Yeah, he's done.
 So you're really going back  to the Diamond Kingdom?
 Yeah.
 The Queen of Witches sealed the effects  of Puppet's Blood into this medicine.
 I'll pass it off as some longevity  drug and give it to the king,
 and put an end to Morris's plans.
 And I'll remake the Diamond Kingdom  into a peaceful nation.
 I decided that I'll help Mars out.
 That seems like the quickest way to get into  the top ranks of the Diamond Kingdom.
 Uh, can we trust this guy?
 I'll become someone you can approve of,
 and one day I'll come to  visit you again, Teach.
 We'll keep Fana with us.
 Mars, Ladros, don't push yourselves too hard.
 Don't worry. We'll take good care of her.
 I'll do my best to make sure she doesn't  have to see Master naked.
 Fana, I'm sorry. Please wait  until I've changed the country.
 I swear that I'll make the Diamond Kingdom  the sort of place you can return to.
 I'll wait as long as it takes!
 Once the Diamond Kingdom is peaceful,  let's go see the world together!
 Of course!
 I'm so jealous!
 Sister, one day, that'll be you and me.
 Asta...
 You called me a friend.
 If you run into trouble, I'll come help  you at any time, no matter where you are.
 That's what friends are for, right?
 Yeah!
 If you ever need any help, let me know!
 I'll blast my way right  into the Diamond Kingdom!
 You are free.
 But this is still your birthplace.
 You may come to visit whenever you'd like.
 If I start at number two, I'll be at the top in no time!
 Hey, don't forget to support Mars!
 Yeah, I know, I know!
 You can't be trusted.
 Sorry to keep you waiting!
 Miz Vanessa!
 Have you finished your goodbyes?
 Let's get the heck out of this creepy forest.
 Aw, man... I didn't have a chance  to get close to any of the witchies.
 Huh? Hey, don't laugh!
 Thank you for healing Asta.
 See you again someday.
 Captain Yami! My arms are fixed!
 We actually made it back alive!
 Thanks to everyone, I'm healed!
 It was nothing.
 Oh, cool.
 So why are you half-naked?
 What?! That's it?!
 Captain Yami! We found a magic stone!
 For real?!
 All right, kid. Here's your first mission  since getting your arms fixed.
 Go get me some booze!
 Huh?!
 Fine! I'll go at maximum speed!
 Wait, the others aren't back yet?
 Huh? They probably dropped  dead in a ditch somewhere.
 Seriously?
 Come on. If you don't want  to die too, get going.
 Yes, sir!
 Captain.
 Yo. Welcome back.
 I'm home!
 I bought you some!
 That really was fast. Talk about creepy.
 So what's my next mission?!
 Take a break.
 You're working too much.  No more missions for a while.
 Also, put some damn clothes on.
 Yup.
 No way... If you take my missions  away from me, what do I have left?!
 Muscles.
 Oh, come on. You don't need to cry that much.
 Here, I brought you some clothes.  Hurry up and put them on.
 We're home.
 Oh, you're finally back.
 That's Magna's voice!
 That's right! Magna and Luck went to  a dungeon to find a way to fix my arms.
 I've gotta thank them!
 What the heck?!  Something crazy happened to them!
 Fallen angel who lost your wings...  In order to see you smile again,
 we traveled to a dungeon.
 We were lost in the dark, drowning in despair,
 and my heart came close  to breaking many times...
 But every time that happened,  I would see a vision of you.
 You shook my soul. I killed my  weaker self and continued fighting!
 Did his personality completely change?!
 The mana is calling me.
 You, too?!
 We wandered the dungeon, disposed of  our enemies, and I became more powerful.
 But there was just one important  thing I couldn't find:
 a spell to heal the wounds  that torment you.
 Powerless and defeated, I had to go home.
 The mana is calling me.
 Oh, my arms are fixed!
 What the hell? Well,  good for you, you little punk!
 Thanks!
 Way to go, Asta! Now let's kill each other!
 No!
 We're back.
 Gauche...
 That's right. Gauche and Gordon also went  to the royal library to fix my arms.
 I've gotta thank them.
 What the heck?! They turned into nerds?!
 I have awakened to the splendor of magic.
 Beautiful spell arrays are like paintings.
 Amazing, Master Gordon.
 Seriously, why did your  personality change, too?!
 Magic truly is the ultimate artistic masterpiece.
 And I still have no idea what you're saying!
 But, but, we still haven't found a  cure for your arms, Master Asta.
 No matter how long it takes, we'll find a way to remove the curse.
 Please wait, please wait,  please wait, I implore you!
 Oh, my arms are fixed!
 What was that, you little punk?!  I said I'd fix them someday!
 Go get yourself cursed again, damn it!
 What?!
 Your nose is bleeding, Gauche!
 It's from rage, damn it!
 Hey, it happened again.
 Shut up, you dumbass!
 I know...
 That your nose only bleeds
 when you wish really hard for someone  important to you to be happy.
 I realized that because this was the first time  we'd ever been alone together for so long.
 This might be the way to cure Asta's arms!
 Damn it, that won't work!
 It always happens when you  think about your little sister,
 but your nose was secretly bleeding when  you were thinking about Asta, too...
 This is dumb. I'm going  to stare at Marie now.
 You actually care about Asta
 just as much as you care for your little sister.
 Just like your sister, yes, Asta is family.
 Which means that since I'm Asta's best friend, I'm also your family...
 I'm back...
 Miz Charmy—
 What the heck?!
 Hi, it's me, Charmy.
 I got infested with magic mushroom parasites.
 Should you really be eating those?!
 I can't transform properly!  This is so embarrassing!
 Should you really be embarrassed right now?!
 Miz Charmy! Don't eat any more of those!
 I-I can't stop...
 You ate one, and three more sprouted up!
 Here, try one.
 Heck no!
 I picked lots of other yummy things, too.
 You risked your lives for that?!
 But I'm sorry... We couldn't  find a way to fix your arms.
 Yeah, I'm not surprised.
 Huh? Huh?!
 You're cured! How embarrassing!
 There's really nothing  embarrassing about that!
 Well, it looks like we've got  plenty of food and drink.
 I'm making muscle-for-brains  over there take a break,
 so let's have some fun.
 Party time!
 It's so nice to be able to eat with my hands!
 Oh, since no one was around this morning,  I didn't get to feed them yet.
 Hey, kid!
 Yes, sir?
 You guys must be starving.  Don't worry, I've got plenty for you!
 Of course this happens!
 Oh, yeah. No one's done the laundry, either.
 Where am I supposed to hang all these?!
 No one's cleaned the place, either.
 Hey, kid!
 Yes, sir?
 I'm out of toilet paper. Go get me some.  And who told you to open the door?
 My bad!
 And on to the next!
 The captain told him to rest,
 but he's not getting a chance to rest at all.
 Well, I'm sure that's fine for Stupidsta.
 Yes... This is where I feel most at ease.
 To to mention—
 You guys are the best!
 The thing I found in the outside world
 is my other family.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 I Wonder Why
 I Wonder Why.
 What's the matter, Asta?
 I wonder why Fana doesn't get burned  when Salamander is covered in flames.
 Probably because it's magic?
 I wonder why your clothes don't get  wet inside the Sea Dragon's Lair.
 Because it's magic.
 Why doesn't konbu seaweed  flavor the ocean like dashi?
 Leave any food questions  to me, Professor Charmy!
 The component that gives konbu dashi its  flavor, glutamic acid, lies within its cells.
 Those cells have what's called  ""selective permeability,""
 which gives it the ability  to take in what's necessary
 and get rid of everything it doesn't need.
 The glutamic acid that creates the dashi  in konbu is necessary for its survival,
 so it doesn't leave its cells while  it's still alive within the ocean!
 But once it dies and is dried,  the cells break apart,
 causing the glutamic acid to come out,  which turns into dashi.
 There's no way Stupidsta's  going to understand any of that.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 They're definitely going to strike  again so they can get the magic stone.
 Exactly what are they after?

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun's Secret
 I'm sure you've heard, but apparently the  Queen of Witches from the Witches' Forest
 has cured Asta's arms.
 Such wonderful news. I was  so worried, I couldn't slee—
 I mean, never mind!
 I had no trouble sleeping at all!
 I mean, you two were so worried, but I'm sure you're both relieved now.
 I wasn't worried about him.
 Neither was I!
 But Klaus, you were dumping water over  yourself every night and praying for Asta.
 May Asta's arms get better!  May Asta's arms get better!
 H-How did you know that?!
 I was also going to pray,  but you were already ther—
 I mean, never mind! I didn't see a thing!
 I didn't, either! I didn't douse  myself with water and pray!
 Not a chan—
 Ahem!
 I'm sure you know why I called you two here.
 You got serious so suddenly.
 This is about the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 They showed up in the Witches' Forest  and attempted to take the magic stone
 that belonged to the Queen of Witches.
 Thankfully, Asta and the others faced them  and were able to obtain the magic stone.
 Asta's amazing, as always.
 We don't know when or where we might end  up fighting the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 And that's why... we're going to have an  Eye of the Midnight Sun study session!
 First, Yuno, tell me everything you  know about the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 What I know?
 Well, they suddenly attacked  the royal capital.
 We Magic Knights went to face them.
 See if you can take my magic!
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 Flame Magic: Sol Linea!
 Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!
 Glass Creation Magic: Verre Fleur!
 Sand Creation Magic:  Sand-Armored Heavy Guard!
 If you're hurt, please come see me!
 Earth Creation Magic: Raging Mother Goddess!
 I will not allow anyone to touch me.
 Briar Creation Magic:  Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees!
 Water Creation Magic: Slashing Sea Serpent!
 Mist Magic: Solid Mist Clones!
 Accept your punishment.
 Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver.
 Punishment for the crime of  daring to threaten the people
 of this country.
 Flame Creation Magic: Leo Rugiens!
 Burn to ashes!
 Th-They're amazing!
 The Magic Knights!
 They're so powerful!
 Let me just tell you one thing about me.
 I...
 hate losing more than anything else!
 Wind Spirit Magic: Sylph's Breath!
 But what the enemy was truly after
 was the captain of the  Crimson Lion Kings, Fuegoleon Vermillion.
 You're...
 I see...
 Despite how strong Fuegoleon is,  we don't know when he'll wake up.
 That was a miscalculation on my part.
 No, this was due to our inexperience.
 We've confirmed that the pendant  Fuegoleon was wearing is missing.
 The jewels embedded into that stone slab...
 Next, the Eye of the Midnight Sun  appeared near the town of Nean.
 Asta and a few others who were  on break met them there.
 It appears that Asta was fated to cross  paths with the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 In Nean, the leader of the Eye of  the Midnight Sun, Licht, and...
 Allow me to introduce them.
 They are the strongest three  in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 The Third Eye!
 Third Eye
 With a name meaning the opposite of faith, Raia the Disloyal.
 Raia the Disloyal
 With a name meaning the opposite of hope, Vetto the Despair.
 Vetto the Despair
 And with a name meaning the opposite of love, Fana the Hateful.
 Fana the Hateful
 I think it's about time we end this.
 Die.
 Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath.
 Despite how powerful Captain Yami is,
 the strongest three of the Eye of  the Midnight Sun gave him trouble.
 Looks like you're having fun, Yami.
 Let us play, too.
 Aw, man... Another second or two,  and something would've awakened in me.
 I'm amazed you can even say those  words when you look like that.
 Honestly, how pathetic are you that  you actually have to rely on us?
 Captain Jack the Ripper from  the Green Praying Mantises,
 Captain Nozel Silva from the Silver Eagles,
 and Captain Charlotte Roselei from the  Blue Rose Knights came to assist.
 Briar Creation Magic:  Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees!
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe!
 The one I have business with is you.
 Mercury Magic: Silver Spears!
 I finally weakened him this much.  There's no way I'm letting him go!
 I figured you'd try that!
 Farewell.
 You're after the leader's head, too, right?
 Go on. Go!
 Not giving up...
 ...is my magic!
 How'd you like that? No magic in that attack!
 Crap!
 Why?
 Why do you have that grimoire?
 Why do you...
 have the Demon-Slayer Sword  and the Demon-Dweller Sword?
 Those swords belong to the master!
 This crappy grimoire and these  crappy swords belong to me!
 No...
 That grimoire is...
 If this keeps up, you won't last, Licht!
 Trinity Sealing Magic!
 You worked a little too hard there, Licht.
 Our boss isn't feeling too good,  so we're gonna head home for today.
 The next time we meet,  I'll show you what true despair is!
 And that will be the end of you.
 We, the Eye of the Midnight Sun, are always watching you.
 They were somehow able to fight  off Licht and the Third Eye.
 If I had been there, everything  would've been easier for them.
 They wouldn't have been so badly hurt.
 After further investigation,
 we were able to determine why they were  after Captain Fuegoleon's pendant.
 They call the stones that were  set into it ""magic stones.""
 They believe that if they  collect all of them,
 they will be reborn into their true forms,
 which are linked closely to mana,  and gain enormous power.
 Apparently they also went after Fuegoleon
 because they wanted the  magic stone that he had.
 There are three magic stones left.
 They know the location of one of them.
 And where's that?
 In a strong magic region...
 The Underwater Temple.
 So you want us to get there before  the Eye of the Midnight Sun does
 and snatch the magic stone or whatever?
 I'm counting on you, Yami.
 And you, Asta...
 Yes, sir!
 I got too excited and  knocked the air out of myself!
 I've never seen someone  self-destruct from saluting.
 And then the Black Bulls headed  to the Underwater Temple.
 Asta again?
 He should've just given me the mission.
 I guess the Wizard King is  rather fond of Asta, too.
 Not a chance.
 Once the Black Bulls arrived  at the Underwater Temple,
 they searched for the magic stone.
 But the Eye of the Midnight  Sun arrived again,
 and one of the members of the most powerful  Third Eye, Vetto the Despair, appeared.
 Looks like you're having fun.
 Why don't you let us join in?
 We'll hit him with all the magic we've got!
 Combo Magic: Flame Lightning  Explosive Cannon!
 Now... scream! Despair!
 Ib I gwabe up...
 Fu curd I brotec?
 Huh?
 He said, ""If I gave up, who could I protect?""
 Oh? All this power
 from a little bird's song  and a mouse's dance.
 Frontier magic is truly intriguing.
 That's right! This spell was  created because we're here!
 We served the sea god, praying,  singing and dancing...
 We spent a long time that way,  weaving the magic into our lives!
 That's right! Ever since we were  little, we've offered up this song
 and dance to the sea god  and the rest of our people!
 This spell...
 ...is our bond with the people
 of the Underwater Temple!
 Did they do it?
 So what?
 Big Brother!
 Dreams? Bonds?
 You have no right to talk about such things!
 Kahono!
 What is this power?
 Let my friend go!
 Girl, you're royalty?
 I'm Noelle Silva of the Black Bulls!
 How dare you hurt my friends and comrades?!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 I did it!
 Impressive... You managed  to draw me out, human.
 What's with that eye?
 Now, it's payback time.
 Mythical Beast Magic...
 A-Asta!
 Not yet...
 Not yet, damn it!
 We haven't given up yet!
 Despair...
 You've lost!
 After working together, they finally...
 How do you like that, you bastard?!
 Asta!
 Little boy!
 Well done! I'm so proud of you!
 You're so amazing, la!
 Damn... That shrimp is full of guts.
 This magic...
 I'm taking you all down with me... No...
 I'll blow this whole temple to smithereens!
 All right! Bring it on!
 Right, consider it brought.
 Hey, you dumbasses. You good?
 Captain Yami!

 Vanessa...
 Noelle...
 Gauche...
 Charmy...
 La!
 Who are you again?
 I'm Grey!
 And Magna and Luck...
 You guys did good.
 I'll be nice and take care of the cleanup.
 Or rather, I'm taking all the glory.
 The reason I was able to surpass my limits...
 is because of all of you, you dumbasses!
 It's no use...
 You humans shall taste despair... Despair!
 Shut up with the despair this, despair that already, you three-eyed goon!
 It doesn't matter how strong your magic is!
 This spell cuts through dimensions!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!
 Consider that my thanks for  looking after my squad.
 See ya, Mister Despair.
 And then the Black Bulls defeated Vetto
 and obtained the magic stone that  was at the Underwater Temple.
 They had completed their mission.
 Also, according to the Queen of Witches...
 That magic stone is a magical item  that heightens the wearer's powers,
 but only those of the elf tribe  are truly able to use it.
 It could be that the Eye of the Midnight Sun are descendants of the elves.
 And Asta, the two swords you bear...
 They are the ruined remains of the  magic swords used by the elves' leader.
 Elves?
 They're legendary beings.  They actually existed?
 We don't know what will happen once they've  collected the remaining magic stones.
 But no matter what happens,  we, the Magic Knights,
 will protect the Clover  Kingdom and its people!
 Yuno, Mimosa! I'm counting on you two!
 Yes, sir.
 There's no need to worry. No matter  the enemy, I shall defeat them.
 I'm going to become the  Wizard King. So, Asta...
 I'm never going to lose to you!
 My lot got this from the old  hag in the Witches' Forest.
 They defeated the Diamond Kingdom's  forces and the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 I heard the Black Bulls did  an excellent job again.
 I thank you all.
 Thanks. But nothing's going to get  started if we don't get any stars.
 You know, stars. Lotsa stars.
 Ahem...
 Now, then... I've received quite a bit  of information, both good and bad.
 The good news is we should be able to find  the Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout.
 Oh? That sure is good news.
 So what's the bad news?
 It appears they're finally  going to make their move.
 Looks like there's going  to be another battle.
 Another fight...
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Prayers
 Prayers.
 May Asta's arms get better!  May Asta's arms get better!
 Five hundred and one, five hundred  and two, five hundred and three...
 Yuno, do you want to join me?!
 No.
 There's no need to be shy!
 Huh?
 Come, now!
 Well, this is fun.
 Not a chance.
 It's a festival to announce all of  the Magic Knights' achievements!
 We call it the Star Festival!  I hope you guys have fun!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 And currently...
 Now that my arms are better, I need  to make up for all the time I've lost!
 It appeared as though peaceful days  had returned to the Black Bulls.
 Man, there haven't been any  incidents lately. It's so boring.

 To put it simply, it's a  friggin' awesome festival!
 Understand now?
 I see!
 Or not at all!
 That was a bit too simple.
 Finral, explain this festival in more detail.
 Huh? U-Uh, sure...
 But I have seniority...
 As you all know, the Wizard King awards stars
 to Magic Knights Squads to recognize their achievements.
 All of the squads compete to  see who can get the most stars.
 Then they announce the number  of stars won in a year
 and determine the top squad for that  year. That's what this festival is.
 Heck yeah! Let's shoot for number one!
 Considering how much trouble  our squad causes each year,
 I'm sure we're always fighting for last place.

 We're dead last, without contest.
 I mean, we're the only squad in the negative.
 What?! We're causing way  too much trouble, then!
 Also, this festival is held  in full view of the public,
 and is the biggest, most-loved  festival of the year.
 And it's called...
 The
 Raging  Bull
 Star
 Festival
 Festival
 ...the Star Festival!
 The Star Festival
 Festival
 Whoo! Mister Yami!
 He's really into this!  Captain Yami is surprisingly into this!
 Right. I can never get into this  stupid festival, but let's go.
 Yet you're dressed like that?
 I'll go with you, Mister Yami!
 Festival! Festival! Festival! Festival!
 Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!
 Oh, sorry to interrupt, but Finral...
 Girls! Girls! Girls... hm?
 There are some people  I'd like you to bring with us.
 This is awesome!
 All right! Go live it up, you dumbasses!
 Raging Bull
 Festival
 There's still time before  they announce the rankings!
 Woohoo! I'm drinking tonight!
 La! Noms!
 I'm gonna go get some food, too.
 I wonder what I should get for Marie.
 I wonder if there's anyone strong around.
 Hey...
 Where'd you buy that funny-looking mask?
 This is my face.
 Stop that!
 I'm super excited!
 I wish I could show this  to everyone back in Hage!
 Don't get so excited that  you end up getting lost.
 W-Well, I guess I'd better  go around with you.
 Hey!
 Oh, there they are!
 Kahono! Kiato!
 I've missed you guys!
 Asta! You're looking great!
 Yeah!
 What brings you here, though?
 I had Finral bring them over.
 Always happy to help out one  of my adorable juniors.
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got  some kayute girls waiting for me.
 Flirty, flirty, flirt!
 So this is what a festival  in a surface city is like!
 It's amazing!
 I'm already grateful enough that you  guys saved the Underwater Temple
 from those terrifying  Eye of the Midnight Sun guys.
 Thanks for inviting us, Asta.
 And there's my beautiful goddess!
 Kahono, you still can't talk, so don't get too excited.
 I'm sure Kahono really wants to sing.
 And I...
 Kiato, did you bring your leg?
 Huh? Yeah...
 We preserved it with water  magic. Why do you ask?
 Good.
 In that case...
 My leg!
 Awesome! We got secret witch  spells from the Queen of Witches,
 and that was one of her healing spells!
 This is amazing!
 I can dance! Just like before!
 No...elle?
 My voice... I can talk!
 I... can....
 sing again!
 Noelle!
 Thank you!
 Kahono!
 Thank you so much, Noelle!
 I'm so happy for you!
 Thank you so much, Asta!
 S-Sure...
 Everyone can hear my song again... Thank you so much!
 That was so pretty!
 What a magnificent voice!
 I guess now we can strive to be idols again!
 Yeah! I'm gonna get even better, and then get filthy rich!
 O-Oh, right...
 That's her main goal.
 Kahono's way more responsible than I am.
 Money's important!
 Hey, this festival only  happens once a year, right?
 Let's have a total blast!
 Yeah!
 Your heart is mine, my beautiful goddess.
 Shrimpsta!
 Magna! What's that giant thing?
 What else? It's a cannon to shoot fireworks!
 Fireworks?!
 I'm gonna be shootin' them off once the  sun goes down, so you better help me!
 Heck yeah!
 Oh, but I'm about to go enjoy  the festival with them.
 What? You aren't going  to listen to your senior?
 There're two guys... and two girls.
 H-Hey... Are you guys going  on a d-double date?
 Double?!
 Not bad, Shrimpsta.
 Uh, what's this double whatever thing?
 Huh? A double date's—
 Th-That's not it at all!  Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?!
 I certainly won't complain about  a date with my beautiful goddess.
 Jeez... I see you still have  a problem with being honest.
 That means I'll just have to...
 Oh, come on!
 It's been forever since we've seen  each other, so let's all have a blast!
 I know! Let's actually make it a double date!
 What?!
 What the heck's about to happen here?!
 Okay! Let the double date begin!
 A d-double date? That's w-way too bold!
 For Kahono to bring this up...  Does that mean she likes Asta?
 Kahono... She's doing this to bring  me and my goddess together.
 Well done, little sister!  Your big bro's gonna do his best!
 What the heck's a double date?!
 Whoa!
 Come on, Asta. Let's go have some fun!
 Ah, so a double date means having fun!
 S-So I was right?! Goodness, she l-linked  arms with him right in front of me!
 Shall we dance as we go?
 Yup. She's panicking.
 Noelle, if you don't do something,  I'm going to enjoy this festival with Asta.
 If you don't fight and win,  your wish won't come true!
 So good! Yum!
 Could you write ""my beloved goddess""  in mayonnaise for me?
 ""My beefy glasses""?
 No, ""my beloved goddess.""
 I can't shoot!
 Sir, you've got to use your magical power.
 In that case...
 Use some of mine.
 Thanks!
 Hey! What're you doing, miss?!
 Ugh! What's your deal?!
 I found this lovely mask that'd  be perfect for you, my goddess!
 Woohoo! I got a prize in the magic gun game!
 You're awesome, Kahono!
 I got some smaller balls  as a consolation prize!
 Those two seem like a good match.
 Wh-Why do I have to care  about something like that?!
 My beautiful goddess, a crêpe for thee!
 Ugh, why aren't you even trying, Noelle?
 At this rate, I'm just getting  in the way of your crush.
 I guess I'll just have to change things up.
 I know the perfect spot.
 Hey, Noelle. What's this place?
 I-It's a haunted house, duh!
 What's that?
 Huh?! You seriously don't  know anything, do you?
 They didn't have these things at  the festivals in Hage Village.
 Places like this are well-known for being  extra scary and bringing couples super close!
 Otherwise known as the couple  establishment factory!
 At this rate, I'm just going  to have to force them together!
 K-Kahono, don't leave my side!
 I can't let my goddess see me like this!
 Come out, ghosts... Or should  I say, cupids of love!
 Bah-ha! Let's go over this one more time.
 You'll scare the customers,  and then I appear!
 Bah-ha... Miss, are you all right?
 My, what a brave gentleman!
 Indeed! I'm the bravest!
 I am the most powerful of  the Magic Knights, after all!
 < Lies >
 Just between you and me,
 I'm confirmed as the next captain  of the Green Praying Mantises!
 < Lies >
 But I've fallen head over bah-ha for you!
 Complete Nonsense
 Let us enjoy this night together.
 Yes!
 And that's how I'm going to  get the girl! Easy peasy.
 Yeah, for you.
 And here they come. Give it your all!
 So when are these ghosts coming out?
 H-How am I supposed to know?
 Phati!
 Aphro!
 Huh?
 There we go. They're scared.
 Asta and Noelle should be clinging to  each other for dear life right about now.
 Phati!
 Or not?!
 Get lost! You stupid insect ghosts!
 You guys had the nerve to attack  the royal capital again?!
 Bah-ha?! Th-They're...
 Save me!
 Don't come over here! Hey! Look closer!
 It's me!
 You must be the boss!
 Bah-ha?!
 Oh, so they were all fake.
 Of course they were! We got  kicked out because of you.
 You flew off the handle too, you know.
 Y-You're just imagining things.
 I-I was so scared...
 Another failure! Noelle has to  work harder, but Asta's too dense!
 I wonder how he really feels about Noelle.
 Hey, Asta.
 What does Noelle mean to you?
 Huh?
 What does she mean to me? Hmm... Let's see...
 Mommy!
 Is she lost?
 Where the heck are her parents?
 Hey, you oka—
 Look at her shabby clothes.
 What an eyesore.
 I wonder if her parents are peasants  who came here to find work.
 What a noisy brat. Peasants can't  even raise their kids properly.
 How dare those lousy peasants  spoil the Star Festival for us?
 Only those who possess strong magical  powers can live in the realms above us.
 There's prejudice against  those who lack magical powers.
 Even though we're all human.
 Huh...
 Hey!
 What's the matter? Why are you crying?
 Hey! I can't help you  if you just keep crying!
 Get a hold of yourself!
 H-Hey...
 I know!
 Hey, lookie over here!
 Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
 I got you...
 Asta the Superman can do anything!
 He's tiny, but his voice sure is huge!
 He's dumb, but he's bursting with muscles!
 He can't use magic, but he  can slash through any spell!
 Are you making fun of me?!
 He can't use magic, but there's nothing he can't do!
 Superman, Superman, Superman Asta!
 Asta the Superman can do anything!
 Bursting with muscles!
 Slashes through any spell!
 Ta-da!
 There's nothing he can't do!
 Superman, Superman, Superman Asta!
 Wow...
 My goddess, behold this dance,  which I offer to you!
 So, tell me your name.
 Emma.
 Kahono, could you use your song magic to  broadcast this girl's name to her parents?
 Oh, yeah! Leave it to me!
 Emma!
 How can I ever thank you?
 I'm glad your mom showed up.
 Thank you, everyone.
 Didn't I tell you to stay put?  I'm here to work, remember?
 I'm sorry. The festival seemed so fun...
 Thank you so much.
 Those ornaments... You're royalty?!
 From the House of Silva?
 I-I'm so terribly sorry!
 My daughter didn't offend  you in any way, did she?!
 Sh-She's royalty?
 She has silver hair... She must  belong to the House of Silva!
 It's rude enough for any  peasant to even speak to her!
 Yes, I am royalty.
 We're said to have the best  magic in this kingdom.
 And that's exactly why we should  extend a helping hand to everyone.
 Being arrogant because  you think you're better
 than everyone else and  looking down on others...
 Only those with shallow hearts do that!
 You can enjoy the festival too, Emma.
 It doesn't matter if you're a royal,  an aristocrat, a commoner, or a peasant!
 Everyone should have fun together!
 You're so cool, miss!
 What does Noelle mean to you?
 Well...
 I guess...
 I like Noelle quite a bit.
 Take that!
 Whoo! Fireworks!
 Huh? What's wrong?
 Finally!
 Come on, Noelle!  Tell him how you really feel!
 Where...
 Where the heck did that come from?!
 Have you lost your mind?!
 What the heck?!
 That's hot!
 Whoa...
 That's royalty for you.
 Is he okay?
 Yeesh...
 Asta, did you fly off in  consideration for my feelings?
 Jeez... He's so dense, and she just  can't be honest with herself.
 What was that?
 I-I thought I was going to die...
 Festival
 I've wanted to settle the score  with you for a long time.
 Wh-What's going on?
 Petit Clover

 Hitman
 Hitman.
 My angel... No, my client, Marie...
 As you requested, your big brother  is going to end that man's life.
 The target is that doll.
 We are hoomans.
 Marie likes that thing a lot lately.  I'm going to bring it down.
 With all my magical powers!
 Mirror Magic...
 Real Double! And then...
 Reflect Refrain!
 Hoomans... Hoomans...
 Wha— We missed!
 Hoomans...
 Oh, this really short, buff  kid broke that gun earlier.
 He's going to die!
 I went on a d-date with you, so  you'd better be grateful, Stupidsta!
 Wait, who said it was a date?! I'm a royal!

68,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Star Festival, held in the  royal capital, had begun.
 The Star Festival was held
 to acknowledge the Magic  Knights Squads' achievements
 and announce who had received the most  stars from the Wizard King that year.
 Kahono! Kiato!
 Asta had invited Kahono and Kiato from  the Underwater Temple to the festival
 and used the Queen of  Witches' secret witch spells
 to heal Kahono's injured throat  and Kiato's injured leg.
 Asta and the others enjoyed  the festival, but...
 Hey, Asta.
 What does Noelle mean to you?
 Huh?
 What does she mean to me?
 I guess...
 I like Noelle quite a bit.
 Where...
 Where the heck did that come from?!
 Have you lost your mind?!
 What the heck?!
 Festival
 Asta ended up stumbling upon  Yami and Captain Jack the Ripper
 of the Green Praying Mantises facing  off in a rather heated situation.
 Battle to the Death?!  Yami VS Jack
 Hey, mister! Can I get another drink?
 Come one, come all!
 Behold the song and dance  of the Underwater Temple!
 Such a beautiful song!
 And that boy dances so elegantly.
 Kahono can sing again,  and Kiato can dance again.
 That's so wonderful.
 Don't you think so, Stupidsta?
 Wh-Who the heck are you? I'm royalty!
 I'm terribly sorry.
 I forgot. I blasted him away.
 How dare he fly off somewhere?
 Stupid Stupidsta.
 Stupidsta, where did you go? Hey!
 How about some food, missy?
 Maybe later.
 Want to take a shot or two, miss?
 Maybe later.
 Would you like to try one, miss?
 Maybe...
 Gulp.
 ...later.
 I guess common food is okay.  This isn't bad at all.
 Anyway, I wonder where Stupidsta flew off to.
 Mana seems to be concentrating over there...
 How about some squid?
 Raging Bull
 Everyone, come try out Captain Yami's  yummy—I mean, Yami—grilled squid!
 Bah-ha! Bah-ha! Bah-ha!
 Captain Jack's meat dishes are the best!
 You only need one bite to feel satisfied!
 It's piping hot! Your mouth can't help  but go bah-ha, bah-ha, bah-ha!
 You mean they'll be going  aph, aph, aphew! That's hot!
 Your heart and stomach will  feel phat and content!
 No shit.
 Festival
 Raging Bull
 What the hell, kid? Where are all our customers?
 If you don't get us some customers, I'll kill you.
 Y-Yes, sir! Mister,  how about a squidtastic squid?
 Whaddya say?
 Hey, don't run away!
 Come on! At least try one!
 Newbie! If you don't get me more  customers, I'm gonna slice you up.
 B-Bah-ha?! I promise he's  not scary, everyone!
 Please buy some, bah-ha!
 Come on, you two! Bring in some customers!
 Got it.
 Please, buy one!
 Please! Please buy some, bah-ha!
 Come on, please? Come buy one!
 Buy some!
 Please!
 Sir? They won't even look at me.
 The unpopular captain of the Black Bulls
 and our captain are right  next to each other.
 There's no way anyone's gonna buy from us.
 Bah-ha, bah-ha...
 Phati, phati...
 Aph, aph...
 What was that?
 This is delicious! Super delicious! Please buy some!
 I promise it's not poisoned!
 I was wondering why mana was concentrating  over here. What are you doing?
 Help me out, Noelle!
 Huh? Oh...
 Guess you're here, too, Bah-ha.
 Specialty Grilled Squid
 Young lady from the Black Bulls...
 My name is not ""Bah-ha,"" it's Sekke.
 I'm Sekke Bronzazza, bah-ha!
 Oh. Whatever.
 So, what are you and Bah...  er, Sekke, doing, Asta?
 Captain Yami and...
 ...Captain Jack...
 I've wanted to settle the score  with you for a long time.
 Your food stall and my food stall...
 Let's see who sells the most!
 It's on!
 Bring it! There's no way I'm gonna lose!
 You grandpa-faced fisherman!
 If you lose, I'll flay you alive!
 Bring it on, you giant string bean!
 If you lose, I'll make you wipe my ass!
 It's on! I ain't gonna lose!
 No matter what...
 ...I'm gonna win!
 Grilled Squid
 Er...
 Say what?
 That's why we got roped  into bringing customers in.
 But neither stall has sold anything.
 How about some grilled purple  snakes I just caught over there?
 That sounds super tast—I'm kidding!
 It sounds gross!
 Stop getting distracted by other stalls.
 But purple snakes...
 My rainbow squids...
 I risked my life catching them in  a storm off the coast of Raquey,
 using my years of fishing experience!
 They're the finest you can get!
 Don't you dare compare them to some snakes!
 I'm sorry!
 If I lose to Jack, it'll be all your fault.
 H-How about some grilled squid?!
 They were caught fresh of the coast of  Raquey! They're the finest you can get!
 They're delicious, just like  the tatoes from Hage Village!
 What are you trying to do? Ruin my business?
 No!
 So it is your fault that I  haven't sold a single one yet!
 Squid... Squid, squid... Squid...
 Stupidsta!
 Tch. You're friggin' worthless.
 Mine were useless, too.
 We don't have time to wait and  see who can get better sales.
 Imagine that. I was just  thinking the same thing.
 Why don't we...
 ...fight each other with our own abilities!
 Dead or alive!
 Wait, what?
 Look that way!
 Huh?
 Dead or alive!
 Look that way!
 Look that way!
 What is this?
 Take that!
 Next!
 We're not getting anywhere.
 Guess we need to step it up a notch!
 If I actually get serious, you're gonna die.
 That's my line!
 Let's change locations. We're gonna  end up causing a disturbance here.
 We'll be going now.
 Excuse us!
 Asta! Stupidsta!
 Noelle.
 Get a hold of yourself! Stupidsta!
 Noelle!
 What?
 Get Finral's ass down here.
 Hey, this is...
 We won't bother anyone here.
 I'm on another level today...  Just like this grilled squid!
 And I'll slice you in half,  just like that grilled squid!
 Why did I have to come, too?
 This is also pretty tasty.
 Captain Jack can slice a  giant mountain in bah-half!
 You may be the Captain of the Black Bulls,  but you're no match for Captain Jack!
 Bah-ha! Bah-ha! Bah-haha!
 What's got Bah-ha so worked up?
 That festival had the girls so laid-back  that my flirting almost worked.
 Man...
 Yami and Jack having a  no-holds-barred battle...
 I wonder what kind of  powerful spells I'll see.
 I can't wait!
 You ready for this, Jack the Ripper?
 That's my line! Yami Sukehiro,  my blades are tingling!
 They can't wait to slice and dice you!
 Last time, you were almost dead, so slicing  you up wouldn't have been worth it.
 Who was almost dead, now?
 You, you dumbass!
 You let those Eye of the Midnight Sun bastards beat the shit out of you!
 I was only acting like they  beat the shit out of me.
 I was going to turn things around  right when you guys showed up.
 Whatever. Looks like you're  getting worked up, Yami.
 You'll actually be worth slicing up today!
 Let's see who's gonna be slicing up who!
 Well, I see they're as terrifying as ever.
 Holy crap! I can feel their electrifying  ki all the way over here!
 Why are all the Magic Knights  Squad Captains so weird?
 Let's see what kind of battle unfolds!
 Again, why are you so worked up?
 Bah-ha!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade!
 Nice!
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe!
 Wow...
 Hmph. That's nothing special.
 If Captain Yami got serious—
 You're amazing, Captain Jack! Bah-hahaha!
 Hey, watch it, damn it!
 He's okay!
 Captain Yami's Lightless Blade  can draw out the enemy's spell!
 So that's how he avoided that attack.
 You're so awesome, Captain Yami!
 Yami and Jack, both of your spells  are amazing! Well done, boys!
 I guess I'll start this next round.
 I'll show you an extra-special spell.
 Extra-special?
 I awakened a new spell during the  mission to the Underwater Temple.
 My own talent scares me sometimes.
 All right, bring it on!
 A new spell?
 Wait, don't tell me...
 Bah-ha, bah-ha?
 He's going to use that on Captain Jack?
 Uh, Finral, shouldn't we be  stopping Captain Yami now?
 Uh, what?
 This is dangerous, even for Captain Jack.
 Yeah! Stop them!
 What if something happens to one of  the Magic Knights Squad Captains?
 What do you expect me to do?
 If one of them goes down, the other's  going to be held responsible.
 And if that happens, the forces protecting  the Clover Kingdom will be weakened!
 Then what do you think will happen?
 What will happen?
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun or  the Diamond Kingdom might attack!
 If you don't stop them now,  it'll be all your fault!
 It's my fault?!
 It's all your fault! Bah-haha!
 Seriously, who the hell are you?
 Hurry up and stop them.
 I'm royalty, remember?
 What does that have to do  with anything right now?!
 But I probably should try to stop them.
 Either of them getting  defeated would be bad news.
 If he actually uses Dimension Slash in here,
 who knows if the rest of  this cave will even hold up?
 And then...
 Everyone will be in danger.
 Since I have the most seniority here,  I need to stop them!
 Yami! Stop! That's enough!
 Finral!
 Stay out of my way!
 He's so useless.
 Seriously, talk about pathetic.
 What is your deal?
 Here I come!
 Come at me!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked...
 Severing Magic...
 Death Scy—
 Dimension—
 Time Binding Magic: Chrono Stasis!
 I would've loved to have  seen Dimension Slash,
 but as you mentioned, if something were to  happen to any of the Magic Knights Captains,
 we'd be at a disadvantage.
 Not to mention, this cave would  probably collapse from the impact.
 I'll just have to look forward to  seeing Dimension Slash later.
 Wizard King! Where are you slacking off now?!
 Hey there, Marx.  Something really fun was happening.
 Please stop fooling around and hurry back!
 It's time for the meeting  concerning the Star Festival's
 announcement of how many  stars each squad has earned!
 Oh, is it?
 Don't ""Oh, is it?"" me!
 The king is waiting for you, too!
 Please return right now!
 You're always so angry, Marx.
 Your blood pressure's going to go sky-high.
 And whose fault is that?!
 Well, you heard him.  I'm going to head back now.
 I'll see you again later.
 But before that, I should probably make  sure they don't fight again after I leave.
 Abra and cadabra.
 All done.
 Dimension Slash!
 Death Scythe!
 Huh?
 What happened?
 Bah-ha?
 What the hell happened to your pants, man?
 Look who's talking!
 Damn. I don't feel like fighting anymore.
 Don't make me laugh. Now I don't  feel like slicing you up anymore.
 Are they done now?
 Thank goodness. I won't be  held responsible for this now.
 Jeez! What were you going to do  if something serious happened?
 You dumbass. Like this jackass  would go down that easily.
 Right...
 That's not the issue here!
 They say the more you fight,  the closer you are.
 But make sure you don't  fight too much, bah-ha.
 Seriously, who do you think you are?
 This isn't half bad.
 Your meat dish isn't that bad, either.
 Right? Now, I'll make you some dessert.
 Hey, go get that one thing!
 Bah-ha!
 Ice
 Now hold it down.
 Bah-ha! So cold...
 Raging Bull
 Ice
 Not bad.
 Here ya go.
 Thanks.
 The more you fight, the closer you are, huh?
 Maybe Sekke is right.
 S-Stupidsta...
 I-I don't mind f-fighting  with you once in a while.
 S-Sure?
 Well, I'll be going now.  I'm gonna go join everyone else.
 Let's call it a draw for today.
 That makes it 53 wins,  0 losses, and 34 draws for me.
 Huh? What the hell are you talking about?
 You mean it's my 98 wins,  0 losses, and 1 draw.
 You must be going senile.  It's my 156 wins and 0 losses.
 I'm the one with 567 victories here.
 Oh?
 You want a piece of me?!
 I've been wanting to settle the  score with you for a long time now.
 Guess tonight's the night.
 You giant string bean!
 You grandpa-faced fisherman!
 Again?! Asta, stop them!
 Me?!
 Well, who else is there?
 You go do it!
 But I'm royalty!
 Now, now, let's just—
 Shut up!
 See? There's no one else.
 Okay, fine...
 Raging Bull
 U-Um, Captain Yami, Captain Jack...
 Come on, we're at this super fun  festival, so let's not fight.
 Let's just all get along, okay? 'Kay?
 You're in my way.
 Stay out of my way!
 Stupidsta!
 Everyone, thanks for your support!
 We're going to become the biggest  idols in the Clover Kingdom someday!
 Idols that can sing, dance, and use magic!
 I'm Kahono!
 And I'm Kiato!
 We look forward to your support!
 We look forward to plenty of yuls, too!
 Oh, no!
 Lots and lots!
 Asta?
 You're late, Finral. Where were you?
 I bet you asked a girl out  again just to get rejected.
 I mean, that happened too, but...
 A few other things happened, too.
 Other things?
 I'm pretty exhausted.
 Oh, come on. The festival just started.
 Oh, thanks.
 Go on. Drink up! Cheers!
 Cheers.
 I know.
 Captain Yami must've summoned  you to use your spatial magic.
 That must've been rough.  Thanks for all you do.
 Cheers.
 Y-You okay?
 Captain Yami, I flew super far!
 He's actually okay.
 He's so tough.
 Where the heck am I?
 I need to get back to everyone else.
 Wow, she's so beautiful.
 She's so elegant.
 Is she from some wealthy family?
 Hey, go talk to her, man.
 No way! How could I?
 She is super pretty. I bet  Finral would love her.
 But I feel like I've seen her before.

 Grilled Squid
 Grilled Squid.
 Today, I'll show you how to make  some delicious grilled squid.
 Yeah!
 It's super simple. Anyone can do it.
 You say that,
 but you're not going to cheat and use  magic like that one chef did, are you?
 Just watch.
 First, you pull out its insides and cut slits into it.
 Those are actually real instructions!
 Then you season it with sugar,  salt, mirin, and ginger.
 Still real instructions!
 Then, you grill it.
 This is normal cooking!
 All done.
 Yummy!
 There you go. Simple grilled squid  that anyone can make.
 There's no punchline this time.
 Festivals are the best!
 Girls let their guard down a little, too!
 Okay, I'm gonna get me a girl!

 She's even more beautiful than usual!

69,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Wizard King gives stars to the Magic Knights Squads
 for every achievement they accomplish.
 The squads compete to obtain the most stars.
 The Star Festival is where the  number of stars each squad
 has accumulated in that year  is announced to the public.
 While the usually peaceful  Star Festival was going on,
 Yami and the captain of the  Green Praying Mantises, Jack the Ripper,
 decide to battle it out  over something insignificant.
 Abra and cadabra.
 Their issues were resolved by  an unexpected turn of events,
 and everyone returned to the Star Festival.
 The Briar Maiden's Melancholy
 Wow, she's so beautiful.
 She's so elegant.
 Is she from some wealthy family?
 Hey, go talk to her, man.
 No way! How could I?
 She is super pretty. I bet  Finral would love her.
 Truly exquisite. I've decided.
 You will be my companion tonight.
 That's Baron Balmain from  the House of Bamilton.
 First, let us enjoy this festival together.
 Come with me.
 Ignoring me, are you? You've got some nerve!
 Just who do you think I am? I'm—
 Hey!
 Huh?
 That would be my line.
 We don't get to enjoy festivals  like this every day,
 Blue Rose Knights Squad, 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight Sol Marron
 so let's doll ourselves up a bit, er...
 Who do you think I am?
 This magic...
 She's the captain of the Blue Rose Knights!
 Blue Rose Knights Captain Charlotte Roselei
 Whatcha doin', Sis?
 Call me ""Captain.""
 You got it, Sis!
 Come with you?
 Were you planning to use  me as some accessory?
 And without my consent, no less. What were you thinking?
 The House of Bamilton? I belong  to the House of Roselei.
 Did you think you could approach me  so casually because I'm a woman?
 Is there a single way in  which you are superior to me?
 Honestly... where did Asta run off to now?
 Well, he did take quite a flight.
 I don't think I've ever seen so many people.
 Feel free to take my hand at  any time so you don't get lost.
 What's going on?
 What's the matter? Use your magic  to do something about my briars.
 Woohoo! You go, Sis! You're as cool as ever!
 Call me ""Captain.""
 You got it, Sis!
 Wait, wait, wait!  You're supposed to stop her!
 That guy's seriously gonna die!
 Is something wrong? Did you find Asta?
 Looks like some drunk is  dancing naked over there.
 It's nothing for royalty to see.
 H-H-Hey!
 Hi there.
 You're...
 The little runt from the  distinguished service ceremony!
 Who are you callin' a runt?!
 I mean, you're definitely a little runt.
 Shut up, you giant woman!
 Huh? What was that, you little mouse?
 You want me to stomp you?
 Please don't!
 More importantly, Sis!
 Call me ""Captain.""
 You got it, Sis!
 I found this super awesome dress!
 What I have on right now is fine.
 I know you'll look great in it, Sis!
 Come on. Let's go!
 H-Hey!
 Stop it, Sol.
 Come on, don't be like that!
 Woohoo! Your skin is as  lovely and pale as ever!
 It's smoother than marble!
 Hey, stop that!
 Drinking at a festival is  on a whole 'nother level!
 Yeah! Eating at a festival makes the  food taste even more delicious, la!
 S-So many people!
 I'm so embarrassed! Nom...
 Oh, wow. It really is delicious.
 I wanted to come with Marie.
 It tastes special somehow.
 Maybe it's because we're at a festival.
 Oh, it must be because I'm  with you, Big Brother!
 Festivals get me so pumped up!  The inner man in me is raring to get out!
 I know, right? Wanna fight?
 Hell no!
 Festivals...
 By being able to enjoy a different environment than we ordinarily experience in our lives,
 our bonds become even stronger...
 It's such a special day.
 An unforgettable page in  our book of memories...
 I'm zero for five today.  I'm doing worse than usual.
 Sniffity, sniffity, sniff-sniff...
 I smell an extremely beautiful lady.
 Pardon me!
 What's his problem? There are plenty  of pretty girls right here.
 Talk about rude!
 More importantly,  what's taking the captain so long?
 You look awesome, Sis!
 That helmet you always wear looks  great on you, but so does this!
 A goddess... I'm truly in the  presence of a goddess right now.
 Wow, she's super pretty!
 Quiet down, men. This isn't a show!
 Huh?
 The only ones allowed to get all excited  about Sis's beauty are the Blue Rose Knights!
 What?!
 Still, I can't let the other  captains see me like this.
 Especially not him...
 Seems pretty rowdy over here.
 Y'all enjoying the festival?
 Raging Bull
 Festival
 Hey, kid. You still in one piece?
 Hey, come on! I almost got hurt!
 Huh? Like that's enough to hurt you.
 Y-Y-Yami!
 Why in the world did he have to show up?
 You're such a goddess, Sis!
 No... I cannot lose my  composure in front of Sol.
 Calm down... Calm down, me.
 Just wait. He might not even  recognize me in this dress.
 Hey, it's Her Cold and Prickly Majesty.
 Badump!
 What the hell's with the sparkly outfit?!
 Breathe. Stay calm... Stay calm.
 And what about you? What are those  strange clothes you're wearing?
 Festival
 Raging Bull
 Especially your lower half!  What in the world is that?!
 Hey! You're the dirtiest,  macho-est guy out there!
 The Captain of the Black Bulls!
 Huh? What's your problem?
 Looks like you aren't training your  squad members properly, rose girl.
 Shut up! Don't you dare come any closer  to Sis dressed in that weird outfit!
 Sol, stop...
 There you are, Captain! What are you doing?
 Come drink with me!
 Oh. Hey, Vanessa.
 Who's this woman?
 I'm not sure why... but I feel like  I can't afford to lose to her.
 She's the Captain of the Blue Rose Knights.
 Huh?
 This woman... She's so incredibly  friendly with Yami.
 Is she a member of the Black Bulls?
 I'm so jealous!
 Who do you think you are, glaring at Sis  like that? You're just a Black Bull!
 I'm not glaring!
 A Black Bull couldn't beat Sis  in a billion, trillion years!
 A billion, trillion years, eh? Ouch.
 I can't let the Blue Rose Knights  keep talking to us like that!
 I can't embarrass Captain Yami any further.
 Hey, you!
 I challenge you!
 Ridiculous. There's little time left before  our achievements are announced.
 Why would anyone bother to—
 Huh?! There's no way Sis would lose!
 Let's do this, Sis!
 You're actually doing it?!
 What kind of battle shall it be?
 Just so you know, I'm more powerful  now than I've ever been before!
 You fool.
 Do you have any idea who you're talking to?
 I'm the Captain of the Blue Rose Knights.
 Th-This is turning into a huge mess!
 What are we gonna do, Captain?
 Hell if I know.
 Now, now, now, now, my lovely ladies...
 We're at a festival, so why  don't we all just get along?
 You're a man. Stay out of this!
 Huh?
 You only know how to flirt  with girls. Shut up.
 So mean.
 Then how about this?
 It's perfect for a festival night!  A battle befitting two gorgeous ladies!
 A cosplay contest!
 You can't be serious.
 What? Scared of losing?
 Of course not! There's nothing in this  world that Sis can't look good in!
 Things seem rather lively over there.
 Well, we are at a festival.
 There doesn't seem to be any trouble,  so I'm sure it's fine.
 Let us head to where they will announce  the achievements. We mustn't be late.
 Right.
 The announcement of our achievements...  I'm so nervous.
 There's nothing to be nervous about.
 We will undoubtedly come out on top.
 Right. But I think the Black Bulls  worked rather hard, too.
 Indeed, they might have.  Actually, I know they have.
 We must especially keep an eye  on all of Asta's achievements.
 B-But he's still just a Black Bull!
 They're full of problems,  regardless of their achievements!
 They are no match for us, the Golden Dawn!
 Right, Yuno?
 The Black Bulls are the lowest  of the low. Them, beat us?
 You can't be serious.
 First up, we have the Captain of the  Blue Rose Knights, Charlotte Roselei!
 The cosplay she chose is...
 A sexy little witchie!
 Talk about super rare! Yee-haw!
 We chose the same outfit as that one witch  just to show how much better Sis is!
 The difference is super clear!  Sexy little witchie Sis is awesome!
 Of course. There's no way  I'd lose to that woman.
 Also, call me ""Captain.""
 Raging Bull
 I-I'm so embarrassed!
 Why must I wear something like this?!
 Don't look! Don't look at me, Yami!
 Actually, maybe there's a part  of me that wants you to look.
 Maybe he'd be a little  friendlier to me if I dressed
 like that girl who's way  too friendly with him.
 But it's too embarrassing! Don't look!
 Actually, look at me!
 The Blue Rose Knights' captain  looks pretty good in that, too.
 This is pretty hilarious.
 Next up, we have a member of the  Black Bulls, Vanessa Enoteca!
 The cosplay she chose is...
 No one saw this coming!  She's dressed as a sister of the cloth!
 Look at her slay!
 Apparently, you don't know  anything about guys.
 Guys like this sort of contrast.
 She's usually exposing so much  that this is actually sexy, too!
 May God watch over you all.
 Miz Vanessa is glowing more than usual!
 This is pretty hilarious.
 All right, everyone! Send your magic  powers to the girl you like best!
 I'm definitely voting for the  sexy little witchie, Charlotte!
 The sister's good, too, though!
 Man, I don't know which to choose!
 And let's stop right there!
 As for the results...
 Unbelievable! They received  the same amount of points!
 It's a draw!
 What?!
 Hmph. This doesn't matter anyway.
 A draw? After I bothered to dress like this?  I've shamed the House of Roselei.
 But...
 I wonder what Y-Yami thinks.
 Does he see me in a different light now?
 Then my embarrassment might be worth it.
 There's no way Sis got a draw!
 Let's settle this once and for all!
 Bring it on!
 All right! Round two will  be a swimsuit competition!
 All right, you two, stri—
 I think I kinda like this...  I mean... I-I'm kidding.
 Anyone who agrees with him  will endure the same fate.
 Our Clover Premium Beer uses ingredients  from right here in the Clover Kingdom!
 It's rich and smooth, but you can  still taste some fruity undertones!
 Try a sip!
 C-Captain, you like a girl who  can hold her liquor, right?
 Huh? Where'd that come from?
 Badump, badump...
 Well, I guess so.
 Then we can drink together. Why?
 R-Really?
 Looks like I'm gonna win.
 We're going to have a drinking contest next!
 This is nonsense.
 I've entertained you this long,  but that's enough.
 They're going to announce  our achievements soon.
 We're ready to go, Sis!
 Let's bring her down and show  that insolent girl who's boss!
 The rules are simple!
 The winner will be decided by who  can drink the most booze in an hour!
 The beer we'll be drinking is  this special Clover Premium.
 One of the Clover Kingdom's best!
 No chugging allowed, though!
 We can't have any little ones copying us,
 and we need to savor the flavor  out of respect to the brewers!
 Why is this happening?
 All right, let the games begin!
 You got this, Sis!
 I have no idea what's going on,  but you can do it, Miz Vanessa!
 It appears that this woman  is a pretty heavy drinker.
 This may be a difficult match.
 Come at me anytime!
 What?!
 It looks like she already  drank herself under the table!
 I'm not drunk at all!
 I can't believe she proposed  this battle in that condition.
 I'm still good to go.
 I can win this!
 S-Sis?!
 Yo! She can't hold her liquor at all!
 But that's another thing  that's so cute about her!
 The hell are those two doing?
 I lost my cool because this was over Yami.
 What was I thinking?
 A curse... I place a curse  upon the House of Roselei!
 When your daughter turns eighteen,  the curse will activate.
 It will engulf you all and trap  you within a cage of time!
 Oh, how can this be, Charlotte?
 If only we could figure out  how to break the spell.
 Please don't cry, Mother and Father.
 I'll become stronger. Stronger than anyone else!
 And I will overcome this curse!
 Apparently, she raised her rank again.
 That newbie from the  Blue Rose Knights is so powerful!
 Not to mention beautiful!
 Lady Charlotte, please marry me.
 No, marry me!
 If you cannot defeat me,  you could never accept my curse.
 I'm surrounded by weak men who are all talk.
 I will overcome this myself!
 The curse!
 The curse upon the House  of Roselei has activated!
 It's no use. We can't stop it!
 It won't... stop...
 At this rate, the town...
 Curses! How pathetic... I'm so pathetic!
 I'm so sorry... Mother and Father...
 What the hell's the big idea, you jerk?
 You flung the pasta soup  I was eating everywhere.
 Yami Sukehiro? To think I'd let him see  me in such a disgraceful situation!
 What a failure I am.
 On missions, you're as cool as a cucumber  and always raring to go. So what gives?
 I like tough girls.
 But it probably wouldn't hurt to ask someone for help once in a while.
 Our Magic Knights Squads are full  of strong people you can rely on.
 To have my heart stolen by a man...
 That was the way to break the curse.
 Oh, sweet. It's disappearing. Lucky for us.
 He's such a barbarian.  He's so aggravating, and yet...
 You can't finish it, can you?
 Didn't I tell you not to push  yourself too much before?
 A-An indirect ki—
 Looks like we have another draw!
 Well done! Well done, Sis!
 Great job, Miz Vanessa!

 What the hell was this battle,  besides a waste of time?
 They're about to announce the  Magic Knights Squad achievements!

 I wonder what they're like!

 You can look forward to  the Black Bulls' results this year.
 I know because I've watched  everything you've done without blinking.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Star Festival.
 A festival where the number of stars that

 The squad that places first
 proves they have done the most work that year.
 It is considered the highest honor.

 I hear that includes the new captains of  the Crimson Lion Kings and the Purple Orcas!
 All the captains?

 Festival
 We're late.
 Crap. What are we gonna do?
 Two New Stars
 Everyone, thank you  for gathering here today.
 Over there!
 It's the Wizard King!
 28th Wizard King  Julius Novachrono
 This year, I'll be announcing the Magic  Knights Squads' achievements myself.
 The Wizard King is doing it himself?
 Wow!
 After the results are announced,  the king will also make an appearance,
 so please look forward to that.
 Wizard King!
 Wow, the Wizard King is as popular as ever!
 Now, then...
 As you all know, our Clover Kingdom  has been battling invasion attempts
 from both the Diamond and Spade Kingdoms,
 as well as a new terrorist group  called the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 The royal capital was attacked,  and many lives were lost.
 I even considered canceling the  Star Festival for this year.
 But it's because of all  these events that I wanted
 to commend the courageous men and  women who fought against them,
 and decided to hold the festival.
 Now, then. Let us welcome them...
 Our nine Magic Knights Squad captains,  whom we hold in the highest esteem.
 It's the captains!
 Captain of the Silver Eagles Nozel Silva
 That's the captain of the  Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva!
 Captain of the Green Praying Mantises  Jack the Ripper
 The captain of the Green Praying Mantises, Jack the Ripper.
 Captain of the Coral Peacocks Dorothy Unsworth

 The new captain of the Crimson Lion Kings, Mereoleona Vermillion.
 Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings Mereoleona Vermillion
 The new captain's a woman!
 The rumors say that her flame magic powers  are equal to those of the former captain,
 her younger brother Fuegoleon,  or maybe even more powerful!
 The new captain of the Purple Orcas, Kaiser Granvorka.
 Captain of the Purple Orcas Kaiser Granvorka
 They have a new captain, too!
 I heard a lot of things went  down with the Purple Orcas.
 I look forward to the new captain!
 And last, but not least...
 Captain of the Golden Dawn William Vangeance
 The captain of the Golden Dawn,  William Vangeance.
 Sir William!
 The Golden Dawn's definitely taking  first place again this year!
 Wait, aren't we missing some captains?
 Now that you mention it...
 After I told them over  and over to be on time...
 Yami's late all the time, but  I'm surprised about Charlotte.
 Good grief. There's already trouble.
 You're the cause of it!
 Raging Bull
 Well, anyway...
 Let's announce the ranking.
 In first place...
 The Golden Dawn!
 Kiten defended  5 Number one arrest rate for misdemeanor crimes this year  5 Medical relief to various locations  10 Aided the Zekka region after a typhoon  6 Border defended  6 Magic ore importer arrested  3 Magic Knight Squad financial donation contributed  5 Band of burglars vanquished  2 Palace defense squad assisted  5 Noble Realm welfare facility aid  3 Sodeel Village restoration aid  3 Frontier expeditions  6 Magical mine discovered and conserved  3 Aided in magical item research  2 Assisted in guarding the king  3 Illegal substances exposed  2 Aided in scouting and negotiating with the Diamond Kingdom  3 Nobility guarded  3 Assisted with flying lessons at a children's facility  1 Assisted with farming in the Clover Kingdom  3
 The number of stars they accumulated is...
 an astounding 125!
 That's a huge jump from their  record of 96 from last year!
 That's amazing!
 They can't be stopped!
 The Golden Dawn is on a whole other level!
 The Golden Dawn did excellent  work yet again this year.
 Now let's have the member who made the  biggest contribution of stars take the stage.
 The promising newcomer attended  by Sylph, the Wind Spirit,
 Yuno!
 La?! Yuno?!
 He's a dreamboat!
 He's so handsome!
 Excellent work, Yuno!
 You're amazing!
 What did you expect?
 4th Class Senior Magic Knight, Golden Dawn Alecdora Sandler
 Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn  Langris Vaude
 Yuno... I can't lose, either!
 Next, in second place...
 Do you think it's the Crimson Lion Kings,  like in the years before?
 No, their former captain, Fuegoleon,  being injured probably hurt their chances.
 Then it must be the Silver Eagles.
 I'd love for the Blue Rose Knights to get it!
 I wonder why Lady Charlotte isn't present.
 Hey, there.
 Want to enjoy the festival with  me after the announcements?
 That robe...
 You're a Black Bull. How about no?
 I bet you guys are going to come in last again.
 In second place...
 We're always in last,  so none of this matters to us!
 The Black Bulls
 The Black Bulls!
 What?!
 Seriously?!
 Medical relief to various locations  10 Aided the Zekka region after a typhoon  6 Border defended  6 Magic ore importer arrested  3 Magic Knight Squad financial donation contributed  5 Band of burglars vanquished  2 Palace defense squad assisted  5 Noble Realm welfare facility aid  3 Sodeel Village restoration aid  3 Frontier expeditions  6 Magical mine discovered and conserved  3 Aided in magical item research  2 Assisted in guarding the king  3 Illegal substances exposed  2 Aided in scouting and negotiating with the Diamond Kingdom  3 Nobility guarded  3 Assisted with flying lessons at a children's facility  1 Assisted with farming in the Clover Kingdom  3
 They managed to accumulate...
 101 stars!
 What?!
 We're in second place?! What the heck?!
 Seriously? Well, crap.
 Y-You can't be serious.
 That's amazing!
 Yay!
 What a lovely surprise.
 I figured they'd climb the  ranks this year, but...
 Well done.
 Y-You mean that squad of ruffians?
 This has to be some kind of mistake.
 Maybe they threatened somebody.
 They must've cheated.
 That's not true!
 The Black Bulls risked their lives fighting  the Eye of the Midnight Sun to protect us!
 There's no way they would've cheated!
 Kahono... Kiato...
 They saved us, too!
 The Girl from the Restaurant in Nean Rebecca Scarlet
 Some of them are a bit rowdy,  but they're all kind people deep down!
 I understand your surprise,
 since the Black Bulls made
 their own unprecedented record last year  by getting negative 50 stars.
 But things are different this year.
 They advanced by leaps and bounds  to climb this far up the ranks.
 One of the most impressive  members is their newcomer...
 Then again, their captain's not even present.
 Hey, is anyone from the Black Bulls around?
 Man, that was a shock.
 Hey, aren't you boys from the Black Bulls?
 Unfortunately, that stage has some other  lousy brat's name written all over it.
 Yup!
 Where in the world is he?
 I'll let you take the glory this time,
 so just hurry up and get on the stage!
 Huh?
 He's calling you,
 kid!
 Man, that was dangerous.
 I see you showed up, Asta.
 Heck yeah, I did, Yuno!
 Yuno!
 Asta!
 The Black Bulls' growth from last  year is far greater than ours.
 Asta, looks like you guys got a lot of stars.
 Don't let it go to your head, though.
 I'm still the one who'll be the Wizard King.
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King!
 Look who's talking! Your squad won  and even broke your last record!
 You're the one who better  not let it go to your head!
 I'm gonna get twice the amount  of stars you do next time!
 Then I'll get double that.
 Say what?! Then I'll get five times that!
 So how many times more stars are you  going to get than me in total now?
 Uh... That was double... another  double... and then five times that...
 So nine times?
 Twenty times more, you moron.
 Damn it!
 Well, that was quite the entrance.
 This is the rookie who worked the hardest  out of the Black Bulls this past year.
 Asta!
 Oh, hey. Hey, there.
 Yuno and Asta placed first and second in  obtaining stars among all the rookies.
 They're two new rising stars.
 In only six months since they  joined the Magic Knights,
 they've both built up magnificent records.
 On top of that, they're childhood friends,  and they're both just sixteen.
 They're both very impressive youngsters.
 I wonder what noble families they're from.
 Nope! Apparently they're  peasants from the boonies!
 Bah-ha! Not to mention that Asta  kid doesn't even have any magic!
 They're peasants? No way.
 He doesn't have magic?
 Did they really use their  abilities to rise up the ranks?
 Ugh! What's with these people?
 Bell.
 What?
 Full power.
 I wouldn't have it any other way.
 Uh, Yuno? What are you doing?
 Asta...
 Doesn't this remind you of the  training we did when we were little?
 The hell?! Why do you keep doing  stuff like that outta nowhere?!
 Besides, we're not kids anymore!
 Are you trying to kill me in the middle  of my big moment?! You ass!
 If you had died there,  then that's all you were worth.
 Glad you survived.
 What?!
 S-Such powerful magic...
 And the other guy stopped it?
 They're on a completely different level!
 Now that you've seen their powers,
 if any of you still doubt their  achievements, please come forward.
 It's true that they're both peasants.
 But they've worked harder  than anyone to get here.
 Proud citizens of the Clover Kingdom!
 A round of applause for  these two new Magic Knights!
 And... let us overcome  our differences in status,
 band together, and lead  our country to victory!
 Wizard King...
 I guess peasants aren't too bad.
 Yeah! Now's not the time to  be talking about status!
 Let's all work together!
 Yuno...
 Yeah.
 We...
 actually made it this far.
 And now that you're all fired up,
 I'll announce the remaining rankings!
 In third place, the Silver Eagles!  They earned 95 stars!
 In fourth place, the Blue Rose Knights!  They earned 83 stars!
 In fifth place, the Crimson Lion Kings!  They earned 76 stars!
 In sixth place, the Green Praying Mantises!  They earned 69 stars!
 In seventh place, the Coral Peacocks!  They earned 67 stars!
 In eighth place, the Purple Orcas!  They earned 51 stars!
 And in ninth place, the Aqua Deer!  They earned 49 stars!
 D'oh!
 This concludes the announcement of  the Magic Knights Squad achievements.
 To all the squads... Please continue  all your hard work next year.
 W-We're last!
 H-How? Why?
 It's because all you do is draw dumb pictures. You don't have your act together.
 Double d'oh!
 Asta! How did you get all those stars?!
 H-Hey, let go of me! Have you no shame?!
 No, no, I don't wanna!
 Is he really a captain?
 We lost to the Black Bulls?
 We lost to the squad that Noelle's in?!
 Good for you, Noelle.
 What did you expect?
 I'm sure you'll get first place next time!
 And when that happens...
 Dance a joyous dance with me!
 Hooray for the Magic Knights!
 We'll be counting on you again next year!
 Now that the achievement  announcements are over,
 here's the moment you've  all been waiting for.
 The appearance of our beloved  King of the Clover Kingdom!
 The king?!
 Come to think of it, what's the  king of this kingdom like, anyway?
 Do you know, Yuno?
 Nope.
 That's quite a lot of excitement  for a mere sideshow.
 Now, greet your king with your loudest cheers.
 Now, my citizens...
 The King of the Clover Kingdom Augustus Kira Clover XIII
 Revere me!
 Don't stand right next to me.
 You're in my spotlight.
 My apologies, Your Majesty.
 Ahem...
 My wonderful citizens,  how are you doing today?
 I am the King of the Clover Kingdom,  Augustus Kira Clover the 13th.
 Long... live the king.
 Revere me more, would you?!
 Whoa! He freaked out!
 You can't be serious.
 I am the king! The king!
 I'm the most important person  in this whole kingdom!
 Behold this sublime mana that's  been passed down for generations!
 My thoughts!
 My appearance!
 Everything about me is righteous!
 I am greater than any Wizard King!
 I wonder if the Wizard King would  consider becoming the king.
 If only the Wizard King  was the actual king.
 Couldn't the Wizard King just be the king?
 The Wizard King should just become the king!
 Shh!
 Your Majesty, please calm down. Calm down.
 Curse you, Julius! Stealing all  the popularity for yourself!
 Not to mention...
 The Golden Dawn is number one again?
 You and your weird mask!
 How dare they surpass squads  that have royalty as captains?
 Unforgivable... Completely unforgivable!
 I'll show them! I will be the one  who earns the people's support.
 My loyal citizens, I have  an announcement to make.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun's  hideout has been located.
 I-It has?
 Until now, they have attacked us many times,
 and they had the upper hand in every battle.
 But things are different now.
 We are going to launch an  all-out attack on the enemy!
 To that end,
 I have decided to gather an even more  select group from the Magic Knights
 to form the ultimate hand-picked unit.
 They will be called... the Royal Knights!
 The
 The Ro
 The Royal
 The Royal Kni
 The Royal Knights
 A week from now, I will hold  an exam for all Magic Knights.
 Only those who pass this exam will  be allowed to join my Royal Knights.
 And then, we will destroy  the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 Magic Knights, offer up your grimoires  in service to this kingdom!
 Royal Knights!
 Royal Knights!
 Royal Knights!
 Nailed it.
 This was all Julius's idea,
 but I shall take the glory for it!
 Why are you choosing, Your Majesty?
 The ones we think are awesome are the Wizard  King and the Magic Knights Squad captains.
 Not the king.
 I've never heard about the king  doing anything amazing before.
 Have you, Yuno?
 No...
 He has, like... a lot of mana,
 but he hasn't done a single good  thing for the people, right?
 I guess so.
 I don't have any magic, so I don't really get it,
 but that king doesn't have much of a  presence... and he seems pretty petty.
 Hey, Asta. Take a hint.
 You're not supposed to tell  the truth at times like this.
 Huh? Wait, so I'm right?
 This is hilarious.
 Execute them!
 Execute those filthy peasants immediately!
 This is all your fault.
 How dare you involve Yuno like that?!
 Execute them?
 Seriously?
 Now! Now! Now!
 Hurry up and kill them!
 Your Majesty, please calm yourself.
 Out of consideration for me,  I ask that you pardon those two.
 They may become the shield  that protects you someday.
 Besides...
 If you recklessly brandish your  power over something like that,
 you'll make the king's authority look cheap.
 The Royal Knights! I'm looking  forward to this, too!
 Magic Knights! Show us  your courageous strength!
 You don't need to tell me that.
 If our members get chosen,  our squad's rep will go up.
 I'm not gonna let Yami's squad keep the lead.
 I'll work hard so we don't end  up in last place next time!
 Jeez... This is totally Julius's idea.
 He always thinks up something fun.
 Wizard King!
 I'm sorry for making the king mad earlier!
 You should apologize to me, too.
 I almost got executed because of you.
 Since you two wish to become  the Wizard King, the Royal Knights
 will be a chance for you to  achieve even greater things.
 Yes, sir!
 But while you two may be amazing,  you're still rookies.
 Plenty of tough veterans are going  to show up for the selection tests.
 Tougher than you've ever seen.
 Bring it on!
 If we fail, it just means that  we weren't up to the task.
 Go forward, without getting  full of yourselves.
 I'll be waiting for you.
 Yes, sir!
 The Royal Knights, huh? I dunno what kind  of exam it'll be, but I'm gonna do this!
 Don't cry if I'm the only  one who gets in, Asta.
 Like hell I'm gonna cry!
 I'm gonna pass and kick the  Eye of the Midnight Sun's ass!
 And for that to happen,
 I need to hurry and figure out how  to make the most of that power.
 You absolute imbeciles!
 The Crimson Lion Kings placed fifth?
 What kind of travesty is that?!
 Do you want me to kill you  all right here, right now,
 before you ever have a chance  to die on a mission?!
 W-We just stumbled upon a major bloodbath!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Rill the Artist
 Rill the Artist.
 Sigh... I just can't get it right.
 What are you up to, Rill?
 The king asked me to draw a portrait of him,  but it's just not turning out right.
 I guess even you have bad days.
 His face doesn't spark  any inspiration at all,
 and I can't make it look artsy.
 Let's see...
 He drew him so cool.
 Who the heck is this scary lady?
 Huh? She's Captain Fuegoleon's big sister?

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 After the Star Festival's main event, the  announcement of the Squads' achievements,
 the king made an important announcement.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun's  hideout has been located.
 To that end,
 I have decided to gather an even more select  group to form the ultimate hand-picked unit.

 Asta and Yuno were unable to  contain their excitement, but...
 You absolute imbeciles!
 They happened to run into the new  captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
 Mereoleona Vermillion,  scolding her squad in a hellish fury.
 The Uncrowned, Undefeated Lioness
 The Crimson Lion Kings have  only ever placed first or second,
 and you had the nerve to  ruin that by coming in fifth!
 And just because my vacuous younger  brother ended up bedridden?
 What are you, a bunch of infants?!
 What's ""vacuous"" mean?
 She means ""foolish.""
 Wait, did she say younger  brother? Who's that?
 Probably Captain Fuegoleon.
 Huh?! Then that scary lady is...
 Captain Fuegoleon and Leo's older sister?!
 The nerve of that fool, Fuegoleon!
 How dare he raise a bunch  of spineless cowards?!
 He has the nerve to stay in bed
 and leave me with a bunch  of useless fools like you?
 That fool isn't fit to be a captain!
 That's not true! Fuegoleon's a  better captain than anyone!
 He's right! Captain Fuegoleon taught us  exactly what a true knight should be!
 Not only is he strict,  but he's more passionate about us
 and this kingdom than anyone else!  He's the ultimate Magic Knight!
 You may be my sister, but I will not  allow you to ridicule our bro—
 Then quit talking and show  me your true strength!
 Show me that you're the ultimate squad  that's been led by the ultimate captain!
 That giant fool would never die  and abandon you or this kingdom!
 Until he returns, you need to show me just  how strong the proud Crimson Lion Kings are!
 While my vacuous younger brother is gone,  I'll whip you all into shape myself.
 Where's your answer?!
 Yes, ma'am!
 She's so passionate!
 She's smothering.
 What kind of intense training  is waiting for them?
 All right. Let's go to our  hot springs training camp.
 Hot springs?
 A training camp like that sounds super fun!
 Sounds easy...
 I heard that.
 Then you should come, too.
 Uh, something just grabbed me!
 I mean, I belong to a different squad, and I  shouldn't really be following strangers...
 Asta! You must want to join  in because you're my rival!
 No!
 Bye, Asta. I'll see you at the exams.
 Yuno! Wait, you jerk!
 You're coming, too.
 N-No way!
 Hey! That's too out-of-character for Yuno!
 Take your smothering hand off of him!
 I don't care about your character.
 Bell, be quiet for now.  It's even more smothering.
 O-Okay...
 There's no escaping once my  sister has her paws on you.
 She's a hidden power
 who stayed behind the scenes only because  she had no interest in fighting or politics.
 But if she were to fight, she'd probably  be even stronger than Fuegoleon.
 She's the Uncrowned, Undefeated Lioness,  Mereoleona Vermillion!
 Let's see just how strong you two really are,  Rookie One and Rookie Two.
 We've been captured by a lady who's crazy!
 Closed for private party
 Man, the drinks are extra-good tonight,  don't you think,
 captains of the squads that  placed below the Black Bulls?
 You okay, Sis?
 Call me... ""Captain.""
 You got it, Sis.
 Get off your high horse. You've been  last place every other year, damn it.
 And how does it feel to  be beaten by the squad
 that placed last every other year?  Tee hee hee!
 If you don't shut that filthy  mouth, I'll do it for you.
 I'm surprised you had  time to braid your bangs
 after you lost to those  potty-mouthed Black Bulls.
 Aren't you embarrassed? Tee hee hee!
 I'll kill him!
 Oh? You wanna fight?
 Mercury Magic: Silver Spears!
 Kind sir, please refrain from using  attack spells inside our establishment.
 This drink is on the house.
 I apologize.
 It's good.
 He's right, Nozel. This is  a place to enjoy a drink.
 That being said, Yami,  you shouldn't have been absent.
 You've got one crazy  hairstyle going on yourself.
 Kind sir, please refrain from using  attack spells inside our establishment.
 This drink is on the house.
 Oh, please do excuse me. I shouldn't  have let my temper get to me.
 Thank you kindly.
 My, my...
 Man, what the hell is your problem?
 I guess I'll just have to—
 Guess I'll let you off the hook today.
 You guys are acting like  pushovers all of a sudden.
 Is there something sketchy  in those drinks of yours?
 Yami!
 You're amazing, Yami!
 I'm beyond depressed after  being ranked last just once!
 Yet you looked unfazed for years,  despite always coming in last!
 Your heart is invincible!
 It's so amazing! Unfathomable!
 Even your heart has chest hairs!
 You are the epitome of insensitivity!  You're a total weirdo!
 R-Right...
 I can never understand a damn word you say!
 Just wait until next year, Yami!
 What? Going home already?
 I don't mind having a few drinks  with you tonight, String Bean Scythe!
 Shut it!
 Then I guess I'll just  have to drink by myself.
 Gotta celebrate my ridiculous  ascent to the top!
 You seem quite pleased with yourself  for climbing up the ranks just once.
 S-Sisgoleon...
 Who are you calling ""Sisgoleon""?
 Well, you're Fuegoleon's sister,  so that'd make you Sisgoleon.
 We siblings are not referred to  by such ridiculous nicknames.
 What? I thought you just kept  adding ""goleon"" to your names,
 Grampsgoleon     Gramsgoleon
 Daddygoleon
 Mommygoleon
 Brogoleon
 Sisgoleon
 like some sort of verb conjugation.
 Fuegoleon
 Li'l Brogoleon
 Li'l Sisgoleon
 Nonsense.
 Oh, heya, Captain Yami.
 Looks like she caught you, kid.
 How'd that happen?
 I'm not... exactly sure myself.
 You're coming, too.
 Huh?
 You weren't even late to the announcement.  You just didn't bother showing up.
 Uh, wai—
 It appears you need training,  so I'll help you out with that.
 No, wait. I'm already a captain...
 Good. That's what you get, Yami.
 You're coming, too.
 Huh?
 What are you doing to my sis?!
 Who are you?
 I-I don't know what's going on,
 but I'll follow you to the ends of  the earth, so don't you worry, Sis!
 C-Call me ""Captain""...
 There you are, Stupidsta!
 You need to come give Kahono  and Kiato a proper send-off!
 Also, just so you know, the reason we got  second isn't because of you or anything!
 L-Lady Mereoleona...
 It's been too long. Have a pleasant evening.
 You.
 Noelle...
 Y-Yes?
 You're coming, too.
 Huh? What? Wait, I have  nothing to do with this!
 We look like grapes dangling  on a vine right now!
 My character...
 Quiet down.
 Hey, where are we going?
 She said something about a hot spring.
 H-Hot spring?
 Hey, Noelle. Could you wash my back for me?
 You moron!
 Ow!
 I told you lot to quiet down!
 Thank you for your patronage.
 Now, then... This looks like  it's going to be interesting.
 Strong Magic Region
 Yultim Volcano Trail
 H-Hot spring?
 All right! Let's go, you bloody imbeciles!
 This is a strong magic region  known as the Yultim Volcano.
 There's a volcanic belt laced with  powerful mana deep underground,
 and it spews lava constantly.
 This is a place that no ordinary  person can set foot in.
 But at the summit, there's a  splendid and revitalizing hot spring.
 Well? You're getting excited now, aren't you?
 Come! Let us head to the summit!
 I wouldn't say we're excited.
 Zoinks! What fresh hell is this?
 But a hot spring...
 Sol, wash my back for me.
 Being in a hot spring with Sis! Yes!
 Sol, you didn't have to tag along.
 What are you talking about?
 I told you I'd follow you to the ends of the  earth, Sis! That includes this hot spring!
 Call me ""Captain.""
 You got it, Sis!
 Let us race to see who can get  to the summit first, Asta!
 Yeah! Bring it on, damn it!
 I need to work out my aggression!
 You, too, Yuno from the Golden Dawn!
 You can go right ahead.
 So this is what ""cool"" looks like.
 I don't like it.
 Eh, you get used to it.
 Quit dawdling and go!
 Here I go!
 We'll get by somehow with magic!
 What's with this heat?
 The atmospheric mana's going berserk!
 My sweat glands are about to explode!
 It's hard to breathe, too.  My chest feels like it's on fire!
 We're supposed to climb an erupting  volcano in this condition?
 That's impossible!
 Tch. If I try to duck out,  Sisgoleon's probably gonna come after me.
 Looks like I'm doing this.
 Why did Lady Mereo bring me along, too?
 I have no choice.  I'm starting to sober up, too.
 If I can't cross this mountain,  I'll disgrace women everywhere.
 I'll reach the summit in a blink of an eye!
 The captains are amazing!
 The magma's doing nothing to them!
 More importantly, how are they able to  move like that in a place like this?!
 That's amazing!
 I've figured it out!
 That's Mana Skin!
 To some extent,
 all Magic Knights use mana to boost their  physical abilities when they fight.
 One fundamental spell in which this ability is polished to perfection is called Mana Skin.
 Yami and Charlotte are able to release  their mana at a constant rate,
 even in an environment where  mana is going berserk.
 They are always wearing a layer  of mana, protecting themselves.
 Mana Skin? Sure, every Magic  Knight uses that technique.
 But sustaining it for so long in  a harsh environment like this...
 We can't figure it out that fast!
 No, it'll work!
 We'll get a feel for it little by little, adapt to the mana here,
 and reach the summit before  we use up our magic!
 We've gone soft, so this is the perfect  environment to retrain ourselves!
 Let's go!
 Yeah!
 It's so hot! What's with this place?!
 Mana Skin, huh?
 Yuno, where the heck are we? It's so hot!
 Ah, it's so nice and cool.
 Yuno!
 Asta! You'd better get there before  I overheat from soaking too long.
 Asta! I'm going on ahead!
 Leo!
 Curse you, Yuno! I demand that you wait!
 I'm gonna be just like Sis!
 Then I'm gonna soak in a hot spring with her!
 Damn that Sisgoleon.
 She must've brought us along to  serve as examples for the Crimsons.
 Especially Charlotte. Her poor  affinity with this place makes her
 a prime example of how it should be done.
 Golden's top rookie, Mister Cool, is here  to stir up the younger guys his age.
 Despite how she looks,  that lady tyrant is pretty sharp.
 Quit dawdling and get a move on!
 Or maybe not. I'm not really sure anymore.
 Mana Skin...
 I'm terrible at controlling my magic,  so this is basically impossible for me to do!
 Even though my water attribute should  be super compatible with this place...
 I haven't seen Lady Mereoleona in ages,
 and she brings me straight  to a place like this!
 What the heck is going on?
 Did you say something, Noelle?
 N-No, nothing at all, ma'am!
 Do you have the resolve to climb to the summit?
 I asked you if you had the  resolve to climb to the summit!
 I do!
 I can tell from your mana.
 The little girl who was always cowering  around her siblings has changed.
 You're starting to resemble  your mother a bit.
 Not only on the outside,  but on the inside, too.
 She didn't just have the physical  strength of a Magic Knight.
 She possessed a strong heart, too.
 Thank you. Those flowers are beautiful.
 The baby's going to be born soon, right?
 Yes.
 Once you give birth, you're going to  return to the battlefield, aren't you?
 Why are you crying?
 They must've told you.
 The Magic Knights need you, Lady Acier.
 So why are you risking your life to...
 As a Magic Knight, once you decide you're  going to step out onto the battlefield,
 you fight for the people and your kingdom
 without thinking twice about  risking your life, right?
 In a similar way, once a woman  has a child in her belly,
 she will try to protect that  baby's life at any cost.
 That's what it means to be a mother.
 Nothing's stronger than a determined woman.
 Just like your mother.
 If you've made the decision to climb,  then hurry up and climb this mountain.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Damn it... Everyone else went on ahead.
 There's nothing I can do about this  just with guts and my muscles.
 I-I can't cut the heat with my sword.
 D-Damn it...
 You can head back.
 It's impossible for someone with absolutely  no magic to climb this mountain.
 I thought you might have promise since  you were the number two rookie,
 but apparently your previous  exploits were all thanks to luck.
 Your luck is magnificent. With that luck,  you might be able to become
 the Wizard King even if you  can't climb this mountain.
 If you get the point, go home.
 I'm not going back!
 I...
 H-How...
 ...do you become the Wizard King?
 What we're striving for isn't something  that can be obtained just by luck!
 It's merit.
 Then go on and climb!
 You can't protect others with pride, and the trust of others comes with merit.
 There is only one thing people  want from the Wizard King...
 There's no way a fool who doesn't  know himself can manage it.
 Merit that proves they are the best.
 I'll get to the top!
 Our dream is waiting for us  at the top, beyond merit!

 fighting the Eye of the Midnight Sun  and has yet to awaken.

 I acted all tough and  said I'd get to the top,
 but I can't even move an inch in this heat!
 What should I do? If my muscles  or guts can't get me through this,
 there's nothing I can do right now.
 I can't do this my normal way.
 Normal? Then what if I try  something that's not normal?
 That power!
 But how do I use it?
 Last time, I sorta went unconscious and  ended up like that when I came to.
 I don't know!
 Your head looks like it's  about to explode, too.
 That's what you get for thinking too hard.
 Right...
 I can't think too hard about this.
 It's not like thinking helped  at all last time, either.
 I need to concentrate. Empty my mind...
 Transform!
 Actually, you can go home after all.
 Please forget you saw that!
 You got it all wrong! I can do this!
 I can do it if I try!
 Then I suggest that you keep struggling.
 Yes, ma'am!
 That's the only thing I can do!
 I'll struggle, struggle,  and struggle some more!
 Come to think of it, back then,
 it wasn't just the fact that  I wasn't thinking about anything.
 I was about to die.
 Is that why I unconsciously...
 Then, I guess...
 I'll try jumping into the lava.
 I ran head-first into Salamander's explosions!
 This isn't going to be scary at all!
 No, wait! That's just being reckless!
 Did you forget what he told you back then?
 Stay calm at all times!
 I need to think...
 I-It's no use! I can't think of a damn thing!
 Because I'm stupid!
 I'm so jealous of that  Mana Skin barrier thingie.
 If only I had some magic... Damn it!
 I haven't been this jealous  of everyone in a long time.
 Hang on, Asta. You've gotta stop  being so envious of others.
 You've done a lot yourself.
 There's no way a fool who doesn't  know himself can manage it.
 I don't know myself? Could it be that...
 I still don't fully comprehend  the power that I have?
 First, I have this anti-magic sword
 that only I can hold, because I  don't have any magical powers.
 It can cut through any magic.
 But I can't do anything  about this environment.
 Second, I trained my body and increased my  stamina so that I could use this sword.
 I could climb any other mountain,  but not this one.
 Third, I can now use the ki detection  that Captain Yami taught me about.
 It's now part of my routine.
 Using that, I'll know when the rocks or lava  from the eruptions are heading my way, but...
 Ki?
 Ki
 People looking at you, the sound of their breathing,
 their smell, the motions of their muscles,
 the vague sense that they're there...
 Ki is the blanket term for all of the  different types of life energy
 the human body emits.
 When I do it, I combine it with  magic and muscle, and fight that way.
 Could it be that if I use  ki detection on myself,
 I'll find out more about that power?
 I was right. I sense my own ki within my body,
 as well as something black flowing  into my body from the sword.
 If I could only strengthen this flow.
 Like, circulate it throughout my body more...
 Circulate... like a river? No, like a ring?
 What stance would make  that easier to visualize?
 This is it!
 All right, good! Flow even  more throughout my body!
 More... Even more!
 More fiercely!
 The sword's anti-magic flowed  into Asta's body amplified itself,
 and then brought about  a change in Asta's body.
 There it is!
 I can feel the power overflowing!
 All right, I'm gonna make it to the top!
 I can't stop!
 Y-You can't be serious!
 That attack didn't work?
 Magical Lifeform Borula
 Don't falter! If we can't  defeat something like this,
 we're unworthy to be called Magic Knights!
 Yeah, so take care of it already, Leopold.
 You got it! Wait... Noelle!
 Your attribute is water, which gives  you an edge over that thing!
 What are you doing?!
 Shut up! It's taking all my concentration  to keep my Mana Skin up!
 Asta?
 But that form...
 One Horn Bull Thrust!
 That's my rival for you! So you've  acquired a new special technique, eh?
 That black aura...  I shall dub you Black Asta!
 Wait, where are you going?!
 Hell if I know!
 Oh, crap! Oh, crap! I don't know how to stop!
 I seem to be heading  toward the summit, but...
 That's...
 Yuno!
 Asta...
 I'm headed head-first into the lava!
 You're not going to help him?
 There's no need.
 The anti-magic overflowing from his  body isn't heading toward the lava.
 It's headed toward her fierce magic.
 She's pulling me to her?
 P-Please run!
 Run?
 You fool!

 Impressive.
 Looks like that violent lioness  is as psychotic as ever.
 How'd she do that midair?

 H-Holy crap!
 She's definitely Captain  Fuegoleon's big sister!
 It looks like you've finally  learned a little about yourself.
 But you still have a ways to go.
 Yes, ma'am!
 I couldn't control it very well,  but I was able to use that power!
 I'm gonna get even stronger and  pass that Royal Knights exam!
 So you're finally all here, you fools!
 The Yultim Volcano becomes  completely dormant at night.
 You're supposed to get  here before that, damn it!
 At this rate, we're never  going to win back first place!
 Those who couldn't make  it up here before nightfall
 will try again another day!
 Yes, ma'am!
 I made it here before the sun set,  but I shall climb it one more time...
 no, a hundred more times, and become  even stronger than you, Sister!
 That's not enough! Climb it 10,000 times!
 Yes, ma'am!
 Good! Now I give you all permission  to soak in the hot spring!
 Hot springs, huh?
 I remember soaking in one back  at Hage Village after my training.
 B-But where is the hot spring?
 Holy crap! Hot water came outta nowhere!
 And now it's a huge bath!
 So this is the Yultim Volcano hot spring!
 You can't be serious.
 The analeptic effect of this hot  spring is the best in our kingdom!
 But no one ever bothers to use it,  so we always get it to ourselves.
 It's the best hole in the  wall you could ask for!
 Well, I mean, any normal bastard would  die before they ever got up here.
 All right, you fools! Take off your clothes!
 What?!
 B-But Sister, we couldn't possibly...
 All the ladies are here, too! What's gonna happen?!
 Are we all getting in together?!
 I don't know if her name  is Meringue or Orange Juice,
 but what the heck's her problem?!
 I'm not going to allow Yuno to take  off his clothes in front of any girls!
 T-Together with Yami in a hot spring?
 I like women who like hot springs.
 It doesn't hurt to have someone  wash your back sometimes.
 Wh-Why am I having  such ludicrous delusions?!
 Okay, don't lose it.
 Stay calm. Stay calm.
 How am I supposed to stay calm?!
 I will never allow any man to  see Sis's pure, naked body!
 Earth Magic: Mud Wall Partition!
 Anyone who dares to climb  this wall shall die!
 Whoa! She created a women's bath  and a men's bath in an instant!
 All right, you fools! Hurry up and get in!
 Yeah!
 The view's as nice as ever.
 The temperature's just right.
 Sis... You're so b-beautiful.
 If this isn't heaven,  then I don't know what is.
 Nothing beats having a drink  while soaking in here.
 How about it, Charlotte?  Have a drink with me.
 No, thank you. I'll pass.
 What? Is my liquor too good for you?
 No, it's nothing like that.
 I hold you in the highest regard,  Lady Mereoleona.
 Then drink with me.
 I was already a drunken mess in  front of Yami at the Star Festival.
 If that happens when I'm naked, I'll just die!
 Then I'll have some.
 Despite how I look,  I'm way older than all of you!
 Oh? The Wind Spirit?
 This wall won't suddenly break, will it?
 Why are you zoning out?
 H-Hey! I can wash my hair myself!
 Oh, don't be shy! You said  your name was Noelle?
 You've got some guts! I like gutsy women!
 Wanna join our squad?
 Um... I'm already a Black Bull...
 What's so great about that squad?  It's overrun by men.
 What? Well, the girls are working hard, too.
 I mean, there are some loud  and reckless guys, but...
 But they're not all bad...
 Most of the Blue Rose Knights are women!  All the guys in our squad are errand boys.
 I was hoping we could get that Yuno guy to  join so we could work him to the bone, too.
 I never thought he'd get that strong.
 All the guys are errand boys...
 That doesn't sound so bad.
 The men's bath is right over there.
 R-Right about now, Yami's over there...
 Nude...
 Right over there!
 Why are you floating like that?  You didn't even drink anything.
 And that's how you are after one sip?
 S-Sis, are you okay?!
 You're so beautiful,  even when you're passed out!
 C-Call me ""Captain.""
 You got it, Sis!
 Fan me, too...
 What happened to them?
 This is a decent bath.
 The stars are so beautiful.
 Lady Acier also loved the  view of the stars from here.
 My mother came here?
 She's the one who showed me  this spot in the first place.
 What was my mother like?
 Um... No one will tell me about her.
 She was a strong woman.
 She would give me lessons quite often.
 I was undefeated on the battlefield,  yet I was never able to defeat her once.
 It didn't even matter that my magical  attribute had the advantage.
 The Steel Warrior Princess who would  dance around the battlefield, Acier Silva...
 Her strength and beauty  captivated everyone.
 And you look a lot like her.  You're her spitting image.
 But your magical abilities  aren't like hers at all.
 Your sloppy magic control makes it hard  to believe that you're her daughter.
 Her daughter
 Her magic was refined beyond belief,
 Refined
 and it had dignity.
 Your magic is so crude and unsightly,  it's hard to believe you're royalty.
 Crude
 And that's why you must surpass her.
 You may look like your mother,
 but surpass her with a  strength that's all your own.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Of course. Even that idiot who doesn't  have any magical powers is doing his best.
 Even if I lack talent, I'm not  going to run or make excuses.
 I'm getting fired up,  and my body's feeling warm, too.
 Wait, it's actually getting hotter?!
 How dare you try to show off?!  I'm sure you can't handle this heat!
 I'll melt the cool right off of you!
 I'm totally fine.
 What did you say?!
 Leo, he's not trying to act cool or anything!
 He just hates losing!
 I also hate losing!
 Let's see who can stay in here the longest!
 Hey! Why are you cooling down  the water with your wind?!
 That's not fair!
 It's not cheating. Magic is  part of my strength, too.
 Besides, you're heating it  with magic in the first place.
 What the hell are you dumbasses doing?
 There are better ways to enjoy a hot spring.
 Captain Yami!
 What are the other ways to enjoy a hot spring?
 Do you mean working out?  Or maybe working out?
 It's working out, isn't it?!
 Shut the hell up.
 Is your head full of muscles, too?
 You're the only moron who'd enjoy that.
 No!
 It's not working out?
 And here's another one with  a head full of muscles.
 Captain... Then what's this  other way to enjoy it?
 What else?
 We're gonna go peep at the women's bath!
 D-Did he say peep?
 Are we allowed to do that?
 Won't they kill us if they find out?
 I can't believe what a bunch of whiners you are.
 If you're a true man,  this is a risk you've gotta take.
 Even if it costs your life.
 I-Is that what it means...
 ...to be a man?
 Yes. All guys are like that.
 I'm sure you want to take  a look, too, Mister Cool.
 No, I don't.
 You stupid little punk.  Don't you try and act cool with me,
 you breezy little pretty boy.
 Uh... again, this isn't just part of  my character, so please stop...
 Well, someone doesn't give a shit about  your character, you dumbass.
 And that's me.
 Please stop, Captain Yami!
 Yuno really isn't interested!
 He's only ever bathed with  guys since he was a kid!
 Come to think of it,  my brother loved baths, too.
 Leopold, I still have many  things I must teach you.
 Of course, Big Brother!
 W-Wait! Was the thing he said he  had to teach me back then...
 Leopold, what I'm going to  teach you right now is...
 To peep into women's baths!
 Of course, Big Brother!
 There's no way that happened!
 No... My brother would never look.
 Actually, he'd probably be  furious and try to stop us.
 What are you mumbling about, bomb head?
 Why are you trying to be like that  Hot-Blooded King of Hardnoses?
 You're going to surpass him, aren't you?
 That's right!
 I'm going to surpass my brother!
 What the hell are you  guys standing around for?
 This is a battle, in a sense.
 Why are you so scared of being killed?
 We came here to whip you  wimps back into shape!
 He's right!
 You must never run from a battle!
 We are the best! The Crimson Lion Kings!
 All right! We're gonna peep!
 Let's show them how manly we are!
 Yeah!
 Wh-What is that?
 Don't tell me those guys...
 Oh? Listen to those fearless voices.
 Now they sound more like  the Crimson Lion Kings.
 But they're going to try to peep!
 You're never going to see  Sis's pure, naked body!
 Earth Magic: Mud Wall Cliff!
 Don't back down!
 We are the Crimson Lion Kings! We can  climb over any wall, no matter how high!
 Yeah!
 You can't be serious.
 Okay, get going, kid!
 You've learned a new technique.  Now go become a real man!
 No! My heart belongs to Sister,  so I absolutely refuse to look!
 Uh... Sure.

 Exhaustion Recovery
 Exhaustion Recovery.
 Sister Lily always heals the people  of Hage Village with her sweet smile.
 And it's said that it's the Hage  Hot Spring that heals her soul.
 But there are times when she's so  busy with her duties at the church
 that even a hot spring is not  enough to help her recover.
 When that happens, she eats  tatoes pickled in black vinegar.
 Father introduced me to these, and they  worked instantly the day after I ate them!
 Order now, and we'll throw in some  garlic extract-infused moguro leaf juice.

 Don't wait! Order now!
 She's on an infomercial!

 Hello, everyone. It's been a while.
 Asta and Yuno are working so hard!
 Everyone at the church is proud of you two.

73,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 After the Star Festival, the king  made a very important announcement.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun's  hideout has been located.
 We are going to launch an  all-out attack on the enemy!
 To that end,
 I have decided to gather an even more  select group from the Magic Knights
 to form the ultimate hand-picked unit.
 They will be called... the Royal Knights!
 The
 The Ro
 The Royal
 The Royal Kni
 The Royal Knights
 A test involving all of the Magic Knights
 for a chance to join the Royal  Knights was about to begin!
 The Royal Knights Selection Test
 Good grief. We finally return from  our expedition, and now this.
 Do anything else, and you'll  be obstructing public duties.
 As a Magic Knight,  I'll have to dispose of you.
 Do you have any idea who this is?
 Vice Captain of the Purple Orcas Xerx Lügner
 This is the Vice Captain of the  Purple Orcas, Lord Xerx Lügner!
 His power and virtue are what made  the Purple Orcas who they are today!
 He's the Saint of Pure Ice!
 Why the hell would I know  about this pompous jackass?
 ""The Saint of Pure Ice""?  Where's this ice of yours, then?
 He looks more like a zombie  covered in mud to me.
 What?!
 Two-bit flunkies shouldn't be boasting  about supposed glories.
 Is your great master there such  a piece of trash that he needs you
 to make introductions for him?
 Wha—
 Obstruction of public duties?  Must be nice being such a bigshot.
 You can say whatever the hell you  want about things you don't like.
 Go on. Give it a try.
 Try to strike me down in the name of justice  with this all-powerful magic of yours,
 great vice captain of some band of thugs who likes to throw his weight around.
 You swine!
 How dare you insult the Magic Knights?
 I shall make you regret your very  existence with my magic!
 Ice Magic: Ice Slicer!
 The Saint of Pure Ice...
 Really?
 Yet you lost to someone like me?  Your title as vice captain is obviously a joke.
 That Magic Knight's robe is wasted on you.
 Now, then... Let's see if there's anyone  else around worth humiliating even more.
 The Royal Knights Exam! I don't know what  kind of exam it is, but I'm all fired up!
 I can finally show everyone my true powers!
 I beg your pardon,  but even that level of power
 is enough to disturb the people around you,
 so could you consider calming down a bit?
 M-My apologies.
 The Golden Dawn 5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight Mimosa Vermillion
 That's Mimosa Vermillion!
 I hear she's an expert  at healing and support,
 but she's been learning attack  spells lately, too.
 So she's a jack of all trades?  That's royalty for you!
 Mimosa, don't start any  trouble before the exam.
 Pointing out the lower magic level  of someone who's your elder...
 I see you're as obliviously rude as ever.
 And you're so serious, a worrywart,  and a four-eyes, Klaus.
 Four-eye—
 The Golden Dawn 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight Klaus Lunettes
 That's Klaus Lunettes.
 He's powered up a lot in the past  few months, and his steel magic
 is real tough to break through.
 I heard he's also working out.
 The Golden Dawn 5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight Yuno
 That's... the number one rookie this year!
 The Wind Spirit user Yuno!
 Hey! We had a date today, Yuno!
 I never agreed to that.
 What?! Then promise you'll take me  out on a date tomorrow! Right now!
 No.
 Ugh! Fine! The day after tomorrow works, too!
 I don't know what'll happen  that far into the future.
 What's your problem?!  Now I'm going to mess up your hair!
 The Golden Dawn 2nd Class Intermediate Magic Knight Hamon Caseus
 Well, aren't they a delight, Alecdora?
 Right.
 The Golden Dawn 4th Class Senior Magic Knight Alecdora Sandler
 So many other top contenders  that we all know!
 There's a good chance a bunch of the Golden  Dawn's members are going to pass this exam.
 The Golden Dawn Vice Captain Langris Vaude
 Everyone seems quite on edge, don't they?
 They should all relax a little bit more.
 You're far too relaxed.
 Hey! Klaus, Mimosa!
 Long time no see!
 A-A-A... A-Ashta!
 Have you been well, Asta?
 I've been working out and getting stronger!
 I won't lose to you!
 Really? I'm getting fired up!
 Asta! L-L-Let's give it our all!
 Heck yeah! Hey, your face is a little red.
 You feelin' okay, Mimosa?
 Y-Yes! I-I'm fine!
 I'm nervous since I haven't seen  him in so, so, so, so, so, so long!
 I see you're as loud as ever.
 Heya, Yuno! Weren't the hot  springs great the other day?
 Yeah.
 H-Hot springs? What's this  about hot springs, Yuno?
 I lost to you in that race up the volcano,
 but I won't lose to you today, Yuno!
 Did you do some image training to  prepare for when you fail today?
 We wouldn't want you crying.
 What?!
 Y-Yuno, what's this about hot springs?
 You seem to be having fun, Yuno.
 You too, Asta.
 What's this about hot springs?!
 Asta! Yuno! Don't forget about me!
 The Crimson Lion Kings 2nd Class Intermediate Magic Knight Leopold Vermillion
 Leo!
 I'm the one who's going to pass this exam!
 It's me!
 It's me.
 No, it's me!
 Seriously, what's this about hot springs?!
 Wow, am I ever nervous.
 I guess I just have to give it all I can.
 Who the hell are you? You've got some nerve  wearing a Black Bulls robe, jerk face.
 Who gave you permission, huh?!
 I dunno who you are, but wanna fight?
 It's me, Finral!
 I wanted to pump myself up,  so I changed up my hairstyle!
 You want to change your hairstyle?  What brought this on?
 Change of mood? Did you get dumped again?
 No.
 Oh, of course. If you changed your  hairstyle every time you got dumped,
 you wouldn't have any hair left.
 So mean...
 In all seriousness,  I wanted to pump myself up.
 You got it! I've got just the thing!
 Whoa, wait! S-Stop!
 So, yeah. I wanted a fresh start, so I came here with a new hairstyle.
 Stop lyin'! Like that wuss  would ever come here.
 I'm not lying, and I have seniority here!
 ""Wuss""?! That's so mean!
 Oh, come on, you two! Stop being so mean!
 It's obviously Finral!
 Asta!
 But I think that's a bit over the top.
 Yeah, it totally is!
 The fact that you changed your hairstyle  to pump yourself up is over the top!
 Yeah, totally over the top.
 The fact that you frosted  your tips is way over the top.
 Who cares if it's over the top?!  ""I'm only human!"" by Finral.
 Ugh, they're so noisy. How embarrassing.
 Over the top! Over the top! Over the top!
 The Silver Eagles 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight Solid Silva
 Solid...
 Really? You came to embarrass us again?
 Give me a break.
 When you lose so miserably, it tarnishes the Silva family name.
 There's still time. Hurry up and leave.
 Her magic was refined beyond belief,
 and it had dignity.
 Your magic is so crude and unsightly,  it's hard to believe you're royalty.
 And that's why you must surpass her.
 I-I'm not leaving!
 N-Now, if you'll excuse me...
 That's right. I'm not afraid anymore.
 I'm going to show my brothers  and sister that I've grown!
 You failure.
 Thank you all for gathering here today.
 28th Wizard King Julius Novachrono
 Wizard King's Attendant Marx Francois
 Now, let us begin the  Royal Knights Selection Exam.
 I shall explain the details of the exam.
 The King of the Clover Kingdom Augustus Kira Clover XIII
 I am royalty, and this is the Royal  Knights Selection Exam, after all.
 All of you, work harder to make  me more popular with the people.
 The exam will consist
 of a team competition: a magic  crystal destruction battle tournament!
 Team competition?
 Crystal?
 What kind of rules does that have?
 Huh? We aren't going  head-to-head with each other?
 Don't make the rules too complicated, okay?
 The rules are simple!
 Protect your own team's crystal,  which will be placed in your area,
 and destroy the other team's crystal.  The first team to do this wins!
 You're right! That is simple! Heck yeah!
 If no team is able to destroy a crystal  within the 30-minute time limit,
 the one that has done the most  damage to its target wins.
 Er... We've chosen this format because...
 Er... Um...
 Let's see...
 I believe it's...
 Ahem.
 In battles against the  Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 several squads will have to work together.
 He took the best part!
 We thought this would be  the best way to measure
 the cooperation and strategy skills  you'll need at times like that,
 rather than simply fighting with brute force.
 Precisely!
 Also, I bet I'll get to see lots of their  non-combat spells this way, too.
 Ah, I see.
 Which means we'll have to team up  with members of the other squads.
 Now, let us announce the teams.
 Let's see, I'm...
 Mimosa Vermillion
 Asta
 Oh, hey! I'm on the same team as Mimosa!
 I-I'm on the same team as Asta?!
 I'm happy, I'm oh so happy,
 but I need to concentrate!  I need to concentrate on the exam!
 But again, what's this about hot springs?!
 Asta
 Mimosa Vermillion
 And...
 Xerx Lügner
 Xerx Lügner? Who the heck is that?
 Oh, my bad! I'm a little late!
 But I bet our great Wizard King will  forgive me for being a tiny bit late.
 Who's that guy?
 I'm Xerx Lügner. It's a pleasure.
 I'm Xerx Lügner. It's a pleasure.
 Man, I just happened to run into  a little old lady in distress.
 I helped her out, since I'm a Magic Knight,  so I ended up a little late.
 My bad.
 I see. Is the old lady all right?
 Yup! She's doing great!
 Who is that guy?
 Step away, you cur.
 Hey, come on, now. That's not very nice.
 What's the big idea?
 That would be my line.
 Xerx Lügner? But that's—
 Wizard King?
 What are you trying to pull, you bastard?
 How dare you act like that after arriving late?
 The Wizard King is one of  the only guys Sis respects!
 What do you think you're  doing to the Wizard King?!
 Now, now. Calm down, everyone.
 Oh, right. I guess everyone  respects the Wizard King.
 But I don't.
 Don't push your values on me,  you worthless rabble.
 That's definitely Xerx's robe.
 Looks like he gave himself quite the  makeover after that long expedition of his.
 This is no laughing matter, sir!
 Well, it looks like we're on the same team,
 so let's get along.
 Sure.
 That stinks!
 The stinkiest bug in all the  Clover Kingdom, the rainbow stinkbug.
 I'm being assaulted by  the scent of the rainbow!
 Are you actually trying  to get along with me?!
 Of course not.
 Why would I bother getting along  with an airhead with a moronic face,
 who's a hyperactive dumbass, too?
 You're just a noisy shrimp.
 That's pretty smelly.
 Why, you...
 You jerk with a cool-looking  thing wrapped around your face!
 Why are you complimenting him?
 Are you even trying at all?!
 Looks like all you can do is try.
 Didn't you come here to get  chosen as a Royal Knight?!
 Me?
 I came here to make fun of you people.
 Huh?!
 Was Vice Captain Xerx always like that?
 He's not at all like the rumors.
 I heard he was the Saint of Pure Ice,
 but he's been stationed in the borderlands,  so only a few people actually know him.
 Are you really okay with this?
 Yup. It looks fun.
 Pardon me!
 I don't wanna be on the  same team as this guy!
 Now, now... We're all Magic Knights here,  so let's all just get along.
 Hey... Haven't you forgotten about me?
 All right, everyone.  Have you confirmed your teams?
 C Team Sol Marron   Magna Swing   Kirsch Vermillion
 Who the heck is this tiny delinquent?
 You're just too big!
 What'd you say?! Don't make me smack  those lame glasses off your face!
 What?! How about I bury you in the  ground to make you a little shorter?!
 My attribute is actually earth!
 Just try and bury me!
 Ugh! Men are so stupid!
 P Team En Ringard   Noelle Silva   Yuno
 So I'm with the noisy little  girl who's always with Asta.
 Well, aren't you cute?
 But just so you know, Yuno belongs to me.
 Don't you dare lay a finger on him.
 I'm on the same team as the lofty  guy who's Asta's childhood friend?
 Hey, are you listening? Don't even  think about getting in the way!
 If you dare hold Yuno back,  I'll make you regret it!
 Ugh, shut up already!
 K Team Puli Angel   Luck Voltia   Klaus Lunettes
 H-How can this be?
 I'm on the same team as the  self-centered Luck, the Cheery Berserker?
 Pleased to meet ya!
 Let's work together and do our best!
 Huh? Work together?
 S-Sure.
 We're gonna be great teammates!
 E Team Finral Roulacase   Leopold Vermillion   Hamon Caseus
 He's laughing.
 And so is he...
 I-Is this team going to be okay?
 O Team Dimitri Blint   Solid Silva   Alecdora Sandler
 I'm not a fan of yours, but you do  have skill, so I guess I can live with it.
 Don't go running off to act on your own.
 All right, let's head over to the main stage.
 Cob, I'm counting on you.
 Magic Knight Who Accompanies the Wizard King Cob Poltapot
 Yes, yes, yes, sir!
 Whoa! Spatial magic!
 Right this way! Have fun.
 This is the stage for the crystal  destruction tournament?!
 It's huge!
 The battlefield has a wide  range of different areas.
 Use them to display your  powers to the fullest.
 Got it!
 And here's the tournament chart,  which we determined by lottery in advance.
 Battle wins and losses won't directly  affect whether you pass or fail.
 That said, the more you win, the more  you'll be able to show your true skills.
 Since you have the chance,  I hope you all strive to win.

 All right, we're about to begin round one.
 Whoa! And we're up first!
 You may attack your opponents!
 Though I'm sure this goes without saying,  make sure you guys don't kill anyone!
 Let me stand out some more!
 We've got a high-level recovery mage on  standby, so fight to your hearts' content!
 Oh, hey! It's Owen! Clover Kingdom's  super-famous sketchy doctor!
 My arms are all better now!  I'm sorry I worried you!
 Yoohoo! The beautiful ladies of the  Black Bulls came to cheer you on!
 La!
 I'll do my best cheering!
 Thank you so much, ladies.
 But are you sure it was okay  for all of you to come at once?
 The captain gave us a heartfelt send-off.
 Oh, really? That's our captain!
 We're actually just about to start.
 Oh? So Asta's team is the first round?
 Well, that's definitely fitting for him.
 Asta! You'd better show them who's boss!
 La! La!
 I can't see, la!
 At this rate, I'm going to miss my  meal-saving prince's heroic deeds!
 La?!
 All right. Are both teams ready?
 Yup.
 I'm getting hyped!

 What's This  About Hot Springs!?
 What's This About Hot Springs?!
 Heya, Yuno! Weren't the hot  springs great the other day?
 Yeah.
 H-Hot springs? What's this  about hot springs, Yuno?
 Soon.
 What do you mean, ""soon""? Is it  a secret just between you two?
 Your own private hot springs?
 The water's great!
 Yeah.
 They bathe together...
 Does it itch anywhere?
 A bit below the back of my right ear.
 This must be it!
 It is.
 They shampoo each other's hair!
 So what did I write?
 Tatoes.
 Correct!
 It's your turn next, Yuno.
 Then they draw words on  each other's backs!
 Hot springs? Hot springs?
 Is she okay? Looks like she got overheated  just thinking about the hot springs.
 She must love hot springs.
 Hot springs...
 Our battle is about to begin.
 I, Mimosa Vermillion, will do my  best not to get in anyone's way!

 for fighting the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Then a mysterious man suddenly  appeared at the exam.
 Xerx Lügner
 Mimosa Vermillion
 Oh, my bad! I'm a little late!
 I'm Xerx Lügner. It's a pleasure.

 Show them what the Black Bulls are made of!
 P-Please do your best!
 Hurry up and finish them  off so you can fight me!
 Don't try too hard!
 Don't worry. I know you can win before  I even have a chance to blink.
 I wonder what kind of magic  we'll see. I can't wait!
 La! Have a snack while you watch the event, la.
 Thanks!
 I'm so hyped!
 B Team Mimosa Vermillion   Asta   Xerx Lügner
 Let's do this!
 What are you so excited about?  This is an exam.
 Take this seriously, you dumbass.
 We should be scouting the area and  thinking up strategies, you dumb shit.
 How dare you say something so right?!
 Everything I say is right, you shitty little shrimp.
 Now, now, calm down, you two.
 Asta's so cute, even when he's frustrated.
 As Xerx mentioned, we should learn each  other's abilities and figure out a strategy.
 I'm sure the enemy team  will be doing that, as well.
 Yeah! You're right, Mimosa!
 I specialize in healing  and support plant magic.
 Asta shines best in close-range combat  with his magic-nullifying anti-magic.
 What kind of magic do you use, Xerx?
 Wh-What?!
 The enemy team is attacking?
 This early? Where did it come from?
 First of all, we need to guard the crystal.
 Again?!
 It looks like a long-distance attack...  And yet they're hitting it perfectly.
 How are they...
 Move three meters toward 10 o' clock.
 A Team The Coral Peacocks 3rd Class Intermediate Magic Knight Rick Cornell
 Got it.
 With my Crystal Magic: Crystal Scope,
 I can tell exactly where you're moving.
 A Team The Crimson Lion Kings 4th Class Intermediate Magic Knight Forti Griss
 How dare you insult the Wizard King, you cur?!
 A Team The Silver Eagles 3rd Class Senior Magic Knight  Curtis Wolne
 We refuse to give you a chance to shine!
 Flame Magic: Burst Javelin!
 Rock Magic: Strong Bow!
 Crap! This is gonna be over in an instant!
 We need to work together and—
 Seriously, what's wrong with you?!
 Hurgh!
 Uh, is he asleep?
 He's totally asleep.
 He's asleep.
 He sure is.
 Yup.
 Being seen sleeping by so many people...
 I'm embarrassed just thinking about it!
 Oh, dear. Looks like we  have some sleepyheads.
 Are you two not getting enough sleep? Or...
 Is this your strategy?
 Why the hell are you sleeping?! Wake up!
 We're going to lose at this rate!
 What happened to all those  reasonable points you made?!
 Don't you want to win?!
 I don't really care if I lose.
 You jerk!
 I don't know how much you  want to win, nor do I care.
 Get off my back.
 I was up all night. I'm tired.
 And you can't work on no sleep,  so sleep comes first right now.
 That Xerx guy is asleep!
 Maybe it's some kind of strategy.
 No... My Crystal Scope can also  determine someone's physical condition.
 He's actually sleeping!
 First, he's rude to the Wizard King,  and now he's being this irresponsible?
 Unforgivable.
 No matter what he might have up his sleeve,  they cannot win without moving!
 Let us end this here and now!
 Plant Creation Magic: Magic Flower Guidepost!
 Two of our enemies are near their crystal.
 The other is about 60 meters  ahead of them, up in a tree.
 The two in back are building up mana.
 I think they're going to cast a combo spell!
 But from so far away?
 They're going to attack.
 Got it!
 That was a super fast attack,
 but as long as I can get a rough idea  of the direction and timing...
 I can cut through it!
 All right!
 That was so fast that I wouldn't  have been able to dodge it.
 Well done, Asta!
 Losing a team member is a handicap, but we won't be able to win at this rate.
 Let's leave Mr. Useless behind and  figure something out ourselves, Asta.
 I'll pinpoint the enemy's position and hold  them down while you protect the crystal.
 Then the two of us can close in on their  crystal and try to destroy it directly.
 This is our only choice.
 Mimosa thought of that so quick!
 She must've survived all kinds of battles, too.
 All right, let's do that!
 This is our first joint  operation together, isn't it?
 Our first?
 Y-Yes!
 Here we go!
 Incoming!
 Hey, they're actually trying to  charge in with just the two of them.
 He's pretty good, though.
 Isn't the other member of B Team asleep?  Is he trying to lower his opponents' guard?
 Depending on his abilities, I guess  this could be a way of fighting, too.
 Hey, is this actually interesting?
 Going on a date with me would've  been way more fun, Yuno.
 Hey, why do you look so uninterested?
 I'll just have to make you smile myself!
 Take that!
 Those two are doing  surprisingly well out there.
 N-Not that I care or anything!
 Do your best out there, Mimosa and Asta.
 What's with that guy?
 He's blocking those combo spells so easily  and charging at us with their crystal in tow.
 They're heading right for our crystal.
 Apparently one of them can  detect positions, too.
 They've almost reached midrange—
 I see them!
 Two enemies and their crystal!
 They're here!
 Stay calm.
 Our crystal is unharmed, but their  crystal is already falling apart.
 Plant Magic...
 Rock Magic...
 Magic Cannon Flower!
 Rock Fortress!
 Whoa, Mimosa!
 When'd you learn such an  awesome attack spell?!
 Asta... The next time we meet, I'll be  strong enough to fight alongside you!
 I'll take the lead.
 We'll rally here!
 I'll take the lead.
 We'll rally here!
 You're so damn reliable, Mimosa!
 We've only just begun!
 Magic Cannon Flower!
 Not bad!
 She's not just cute. She's strong, too.
 That gap is irresistible!  I wish she'd come my way!
 That's awesome!
 I wanna fight her, too!
 She's grown as a woman. Maybe it's  because she's on the same team as Asta.
 To think that she can fight so boldly  in front of all those people!
 Asta, you have such a good teammate.
 Amazing!
 Mimosa's amazing.
 I'd been admiring your growth  as I was working out,
 but I had no idea you'd progressed so far!
 I am honored to be your senior, Mimosa.
 Mimosa's working hard.
 That means I need to work even harder.
 I can't lose.
 Good job, Mimosa.
 You smiled? You just smiled a little, didn't you?
 Woohoo! I win!
 I wasn't smiling. You just imagined it.
 Ugh, you're so stubborn!
 But... That's also one of  the reasons I like you.
 Hmph.
 She looks like she'll mature  even more in the future.
 Asta! You can do it, la!
 I'll give you nummies when you win!
 There are two of them.  Shall we move closer and surround them?
 No. The little gray-haired  boy has an anti-magic sword.
 I've seen him use it before. It's invincible in close combat.
 Anti-magic?
 I've heard rumors about it,  but to think a little boy like him...
 It's probably dangerous to get too close.
 In that case...
 They split up?!
 Which one has the crystal?
 Magic Flower Guidepost!
 This response...
 It's the left!
 Got it!
 Anti-magic child!
 Behold my ultimate spell!
 What an intense concentration of magic!
 A powerful attack spell is incoming!
 I'll cut that, and then the crystal!
 This is...
 There are two similar responses.
 The other two have powerful  midrange attack spells!
 This position... We're surrounded!
 If any of those attacks hit  the crystal, we're finished!
 This isn't good!
 If they attack simultaneously, even Asta  won't be able to hold them both back!
 Asta!
 Asta!
 Asta!
 Asta!
 That's...
 One of them can use paralysis trap magic?
 When did they...
 It's impossible to tell what'll happen.
 So this is the Royal Knights Selection Exam!
 Now!
 From three directions?
 It's impossible to avoid all three attacks. This... might be the end.
 What?!
 Our spells!
 They reflected our spells back at us?!
 What was that magic?
 What just happened?
 Asta!
 Looks like that went well.
 What in the world just happened?
 That's a senior Magic Knight for you.
 I thought that would've destroyed  their crystal, too.
 But to think he managed to keep the  crystal intact and stay conscious.
 Good job, man.
 Though it looks like you and the  crystal are both on your last legs.
 Now, then... I don't know  what else might happen,
 so I need to take the shortest possible  route to destroy that crystal.
 The crystal will never... fall to someone as insolent as you...
 Says the person who just lost to me.
 Talk about hopeless.
 Looks like you're short on imagination  when it comes to unknown magic.
 Magic Knights are supposed to consider  every possibility when fighting.
 If people could win by getting
 all fired up and launching  huge spells, life would be easy.
 Anyone who loses to me doesn't  deserve to be a Magic Knight.
 That magic is... Ash Magic?
 That means the trap spell  that Asta fell for was his?
 This is game over.
 You trash can try again some other time.
 Damn it!
 You know, never mind.
 I'm not here to win.
 Actually, I'm here for a  completely different reason.
 What do you mean?
 Psych, you loser!
 Crystal magic stoppage confirmed.
 B Team wins!
 What was with that guy's magic, anyway?
 He powered up his opponents' spells  and reflected them back to them?
 I don't really get it, but that was amazing.
 I guess that weirdo in the mask is the  top candidate for the Royal Knights.
 I'm glad that Asta and his team won,  but I'm really annoyed for some reason, la!
 And the best cure for that is to eat, la!
 Hey, great work, you two.
 That was some nice teamwork.
 You did a great job as a decoy.
 Did you see that guy's face?
 For a second, he actually  thought I wouldn't destroy it.
 Thanks, Mimosa.
 Asta...
 You jackass! What the hell  is with your attitude?!
 How could you do that to a Magic Knight?
 That team was amazing, too!
 Amazing or not, they still lost.
 It just means our teamwork  was better than theirs.
 Be glad, you shitty little shrimp.
 Teamwork? You can't be serious!
 That trap I triggered was  your magic, wasn't it?!
 What's the big idea, you jerk?!
 Again, I had you fall for the  trap so you could act as a decoy.
 You know what they say... If you want to  fool your enemies, fool your friends first.
 The hell's that supposed to mean?!
 Oh, yeah. There's a spell  set on my collar, too.
 My eyes! My eyes!
 Asta!
 My eyes! My eyes!
 Man, you're hilarious.
 This guy's magic...
 He probably seals magic effects in objects  or the terrain by drawing magic circles,
 then uses certain conditions  to activate them.
 That trap activated after Asta  triggered the earlier trap.
 It responded to magic that entered  the area within a certain time frame.
 It's called... a counter-trap spell.
 It sends magic back at double  the speed and power,
 so the stronger the spell,  the more effective it is.
 A huge trap spell like that must have  taken an enormous amount of mana and time.
 When did you even set it?
 It's still in my eyes...
 Weren't you sleeping the whole time?
 It's a secret. It's always better  when a guy's a bit mysterious.
 Mysterious, my ass!
 You crazy, cool-masked jerk!
 That's a compliment, Asta!
 Tell us everything, you jerk!
 Man, you're loud, no matter  who you're talking to.
 We're on stage next, so clear the hell out.
 Who died and made you the  boss, Funglasquent?
 Don't abbreviate ""Funny Glasses Delinquent!""
 What the hell kind of name is that, anyway?!
 You're plenty loud yourself, Funglashorty!
 Who are you calling ""Funny Glasses Shorty,""  you ridiculously giant woman?!
 Magna! Giant Lady! And... where's the other one?
 Honestly... All of you lack elegance.
 Geh... Oh, no.
 C Team The Coral Peacocks 1st Class Senior Magic Knight Kirsch Vermillion
 You're not beautiful!
 Do your best not to taint my beauty,  for I am Kirsch Vermillion!
 Who the hell's that sparkly guy?
 Huh?
 Did he say Vermillion?
 He's my older brother.
 Older brother?!
 I wish he'd disappear.
 I am beautiful. Oh, so beautiful!
 He seems like a fun big brother.
 I wish from the bottom of  my heart that he'd disappear.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 The Next Time We Meet
 The Next Time We Meet.
 Asta... The next time we meet, I'll be  strong enough to fight alongside you!
 Black... Clover... Black... Clover...
 You can do it, Mimosa.
 Black... Clover... Black... Clover...
 You can do it, Mimosa!
 Black... Clover... Black... Clover...
 You can do it, Mimosa!
 And so...
 Asta, I've gotten stronger!
 You can...
 Mimosa, when did you learn to  do an awesome serve like that?!
 I did it!
 Hello there. Aren't I beautiful?
 The beauty that stands before  you is I, Kirsch Vermillion.
 I am Mimosa's beautiful brother.
 Beautiful Black Clover,  Beautiful Page 75: ""Fierce Battle.""

75,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Royal Knights is an  elite group of Magic Knights.
 The selection exam to choose  its members has finally begun.
 Asta, along with Mimosa Vermillion  and the mysterious mage Xerx Lügner,
 head into their first  battle of the tournament.
 Wh-What?!
 For some reason, Xerx doesn't seem  interested in fighting at all.
 Annoyed by this, Asta and Mimosa decide  to attack the enemy camp on their own.
 Now!
 It looked as though Asta's team  was going to lose, but then...
 The trap spells that Xerx set activated,
 and they managed to completely  turn things around into a victory.
 And then, the one who appeared  in the second match...
 You're not beautiful!
 Do your best not to taint my beauty,  for I am Kirsch Vermillion!
 Fierce Battle
 Oh... life is so hard.
 C Team The Coral Peacocks 1st Class Senior Magic Knight Kirsch Vermillion
 Why is this world filled  with such unsightly things?
 And yet, why was I born so beautiful?
 It's so hard.
 Where'd this weirdo come from?!
 Shut up! I just... Shut up!
 You're so insanely creepy, damn it!
 Don't be in such despair, you ugly creature.
 I understand that you must be  quite jealous of my beauty,
 but there are things that  just can't be helped.
 Who the hell are you calling ugly?!  What even is this conversation?!
 Did you get dropped on your  head when you were born?!
 The only one that's beautiful  is Sis, and Sis alone!
 You're so gross, you narcissist creep!
 A maiden shouldn't use such vulgar words.
 Your proportions are somewhat  on the beautiful side.
 Why not learn from me to better yourself?
 I-Is that team going to be okay?
 Ah, if it isn't Mimosa.
 Did you come to admire my beauty,  my beloved little sister?
 Don't let my beauty cause your heart to stop.
 I wouldn't say you're beautiful.  You're so narcissistic that it's creepy.
 What are you talking about, Mimosa?
 You can't tell how beautiful I am?
 Are you sick? Let me cure you.
 I believe you're the one  that's sick, Brother.
 I actually want you to  lose this upcoming round.
 You were never good at telling jokes.
 I'm sorry, what?!
 Jokes should be told with  more elegance and beauty!
 Yes! As beautiful as I am!
 Mimosa's older bro is, like... sparkly.  Or I guess I should say... unique.
 I have no idea what's going on,
 but I guess Mimosa's been  through some hard times, too.
 Oh, heya. Nice to meet you.
 Mimosa's always been so kind to me.
 Are you the peasant known as Asta?
 Yup.
 Don't talk to me as though  we're friends, you swine.
 What the hell?! His eyes suddenly died!
 I can't stand the sight of you.
 Neither your mannerisms nor  behavior are beautiful.
 Your existence is unsightly.
 Your clothes are filthy.
 To top everything off, your muscles are ugly.
 Bodies should be beautiful just as they are.
 I don't see why you would train them.
 Only the weak would do such a thing.
 Yup! I was weak.
 I mean, I didn't have any magic!
 That's why I trained!
 They might be unsightly,  but these are my weapons!
 The size of the vessel into  which an individual's mana
 is poured is determined from birth.
 Unsightly struggling won't change its shape.
 Vessel... Wha?
 How could someone as unsightly  as you become a Magic Knight?
 Kirsch, please win this match,  no matter what.
 Oh, Mimosa! To think you'd say such words!
 Do you finally fully understand my charms?
 Because Asta and I intend to  slaughter you in the next round.
 S-S-Slaughter...
 Such an unsightly word!
 Who's that sparkly guy? I can see  him from all the way up here.
 All that sparkling is sort of wasted on him.
 Kirsch Vermillion.  He's Mimosa's older brother.
 To describe him in a single  word... He's creepy.
 How could you say something like that?!
 He's the Vice Captain of the Coral Peacocks!
 Don't sell him short!
 Despite how he looks,
 in place of their captain who's  always asleep, Dorothy Unsworth,
 I hear he does almost all of the squad's practical magic!
 ""Despite how he looks."" So you  think he's weird, too, four-eyes.
 Four-eyes sure does.
 Four-eyes definitely does.
 I do not!
 Well, maybe a little bit.
 When's the next match going to begin?!
 How long do they intend to make me wait?
 All right, then.
 The next battle will be...
 Sol   Kirsch   Magna
 C Team
 Cesc   Adrian   Willy
 D Team
 C Team: Kirsch, Sol, and Magna  versus D Team: Cesc, Adrian, and Willy.
 Let the second match begin!
 Now... let me show you  how truly beautiful I am!
 Shut the hell up!
 We have to hurry up and get back so  we can cheer Magna and the others on!
 A-Asta's so close to me!
 You seem unfazed, you shitty little shrimp.
 We're going to be facing  them next if they win.
 Xerx...
 Huh?
 You said earlier...
 That you didn't come here to win.  That you had a certain goal.
 I was lying.
 Don't hide anything from us. You piss  me off, but you're our teammate.
 And you're strong.
 I'm going to make sure we  win by working together!
 Asta...
 Then I'll need you to work hard  as the decoy next round, too.
 That's not exactly working together!
 Looks like it's started.
 Flame Creation Magic: Grand Slam!
 Like I'm gonna waste any time!
 If I just go right in there and bust  the shit out of that crystal, we win!
 What a fantastic spell!
 A fifth-class junior peasant?
 Just barging in there  without a plan? He's no good.
 Shakudo Magic: Pursuing Jackals.
 You're so annoying!
 Then how about this?
 I see you, damn it!
 I'm gonna beat the crap out of all  these things, then beat the shit out of you!
 What a crude way of fighting.
 So unsightly.
 Where the hell did you pop up from?!
 You're straining too much.
 You're blessed with the ability to  use both close and long-range magic.
 Your mana is crying.
 The hell did you say?!
 Read the flow of the enemy's mana more. Let your mana be your guide,
 and use close and long-range  attacks at the appropriate times.
 Then you'll be able to burn  more beautifully than before!
 Uh... sure.
 Using close and long-range magic  at the appropriate times...
 Don't strain so much... And read  the enemy's flow of mana...
 I'll take care of the closer  ones first. Take that!
 And now for the one that's  all the way back there!
 All right!
 Wait, where'd that sparkly bastard go?
 Earth Creation Magic: Raging Mother Goddess!
 Outta my way!
 I'm gonna show you guys what I can do to  raise our squad's rank and make Sis happy!
 Mud Binding Magic: Flash Bog!
 I'm not letting you go that easily.
 You and your golem can  get sucked into my bog!
 Damn it!
 Why am I surrounded by such  sloppy and simple-minded people?
 Magic which creates golems that  can be given certain orders?
 Since this isn't a feint,  its size is unsightly.
 What's your problem, ya jerk?!
 Why not split it up into smaller ones  and use them to cause confusion?
 It would be beautiful to have them  lie in ambush within the earth, too.
 You can do that with your  unique mana, can't you?
 Y-Yeah...
 Earth Creation Magic: Divided Mother Goddess!
 Mobility over power!
 We're not gonna get caught in that bog again!
 I shall guard the crystal! Therefore,  it shall remain beautiful and unharmed.
 Bloom as gloriously as you wish!
 What are you talking about?  Your crystal's been left completely unguarded!
 Water Creation Magic: Climbing Coelacanth!
 You're mine!
 I do apologize, but...
 You're already captives  of my beautiful magic.
 Cherry Blossom Magic:
 Cherry Blossom Magic: Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals  ~Plus My Beautiful Illusion~
 Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals  Plus My Beautiful Illusion!
 That whole area's covered  in a storm of petals!
 C-Crap! I can't see where our enemies are!
 This is...
 ...a road that leads straight to the crystal!
 Go forth unto the beautiful  primrose path to victory!
 Full bloom!
 Bloom! Bloom! Bloom! Bloom!
 Fully bloom!
 Full bloom!
 C Team wins!
 It's so pretty!
 In this world, sin is...
 being unsightly, and...
 ...failing to notice beauty!
 We somehow got pulled into his bullshit!
 It pisses me off, but it feels so good!
 He's fast! And unbelievably strong!
 And creepy.
 How are we going to beat  them in the next battle?
 Ah... the greatest sin of all is my beauty.
 Well? How was our fighting?
 Wasn't it beautiful?
 Uh... Sure.
 Bah-ha...
 Why the hell did I do that?!
 Don't look at me!
 That spell... First, he produced  various clones to confuse the enemy.
 Then he covered the battlefield  in a storm of magic petals,
 making it hard to see or detect magic.
 Meanwhile, it created a safe route to  the enemy crystal for his teammates.
 The only way that's possible
 is because being royalty gives  you a monstrous amount of magic!
 Ah... My beauty scares me.
 The man closest to becoming the next  captain of the Coral Peacocks...
 Kirsch Vermillion. Quite impressive.
 But he's still a weirdo.
 That magic was awesome!
 Way to go, Mimosa's bro!
 Please don't mention that, Asta.
 Quiet, swine.
 You're dirtying my space.
 You're next. A broken vessel  like you who can't use magic...
 I'll use my magic to shatter the rest of you.
 I don't know about that.
 I'm not sure how, but apparently when a  vessel's cracked, you can use it longer.
 Cracked?
 You were only using that  vessel because you're poor.
 How unsightly.
 Say what?!
 That cracked vessel was something  Sister bought for us!
 It's the symbol of love  between Sister Lily and me!
 I'm going to keep using it forever!
 Asta, this was all just a ""what if.""
 Your brain is unsightly, too.
 Next up is round three!
 Finral  Leopold  Hamon
 E Team
 Kyle   Borja   Gaston
 F Team
 E Team: Finral, Leopold, and Hamon versus  F Team: Kyle, Borja, and Gaston.
 The Crimson Lion Kings Intermediate Magic Knight Second Class Leopold Vermillion
 Let's hit 'em fast and  loud with my flame magic!
 The Golden Dawn Intermediate Magic Knight Second Class Hamon Caseus
 No, let us attack them with elegant  flair using my glass magic.
 Seeing Kirsch fight has lit a fire within me.
 Let us also settle this beautifully.
 Who cares about beauty?
 If you've been lit aflame, I'll use my  flames to light an even greater flame!
 Also, Kirsch is gross.
 Actually...
 The Black Bulls Junior Magic Knight First Class Finral Roulacase
 Could you leave our attack strategy to me?
 Spatial magic gives you incredible mobility.
 There's no reason not to use that, right?
 I haven't fought alongside  the Black Bulls for nothing.
 I can't lose here!
 This guy...
 I like it! Let's see you bring  out the best in us then!
 Leopold and Hamon are both quite skilled.
 Go after the trash from the Black Bulls!
 I'm not so sure about that!
 His spatial magic is pretty useful.
 Borja!
 Feather Magic: Feather Tornado!
 Leopold, now!
 Got it!
 You're not getting away!
 Curses... Friendly fire was  their goal all along.
 And flame magic is an attribute  I'm weak against on top of that!
 That spatial magic user has a  good eye on this battlefield.
 He knows where our magic works best and takes  us to the perfect point on the battlefield!
 Glass Creation Magic: Verre Épée!
 To think that the Black Bulls  had someone this good.
 Why did he stay hidden for so long?
 At this rate, I can attack  with all the power I've got.
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 Crystal destroyed! E Team wins!
 Yes!
 I'm glad we won, but man, was I nervous!
 Come now.
 We should have a meal after a battle.
 Indeed! Let's see who can eat the most!
 Bring it on!
 I'm definitely not in the  mood for that right now.
 You're amazing, Finral!
 Bah... ha...
 The way he uses his spatial  magic is troublesome.
 He's still a junior Magic Knight?
 All of the Black Bulls in this exam so  far have been junior Magic Knights.
 I hadn't taken them seriously,
 but the last two Black Bulls  also exhibited powers
 that seemed beyond juniors.
 Maybe the Black Bulls really  are different this year.
 Not bad for the guy who brought  shame upon the House of Vaude.
 I'll show you exactly how  different we are next.
 Next up is round four!
 Gareth   Simon   Medeo
 H Team
 Langris   Flagil   Sekke
 G Team
 G Team: Langris, Flagil, and Sekke versus  H Team: Gareth, Simon, and Medeo.
 Crap! Bah-ha, crap!
 The Green Praying Mantises Junior Magic Knight Fifth Class Sekke Bronzazza
 Everyone here is ridiculously strong!
 It was too early for me  to do this exam, bah-ha!
 Besides, what the heck  was up with Captain Jack being all,
 ""Let's give the newbies a chance, too""?!
 This is definitely bad news!
 Why the heck did I get picked, anyway?!
 I mean, I said I could do it, but...
 Are you all right?
 The Black Bulls so far have been  amazing despite being juniors.
 The Aqua Deer Intermediate Magic Knight Third Class Flagil Tormenta
 You're probably also strong, aren't you?
 Bah-ha! I'm surprised you saw through me!
 What to do...
 I don't like standing out,  but I guess I don't have a choice.
 First off, why don't I go rampaging  in on my Sekke Shooting Star?
 Um...
 That sounds like a great plan.
 The Golden Dawn Vice Captain Langris Vaude
 All right. The crystal is completely  covered with a barrier spell.
 No one can destroy it easily now.
 Keep going straight.
 You got it, bah-ha!
 They're charging straight at us?
 What the hell is that lame vehicle?
 You fools!
 Now you can fall for the trap  spells we set in the earth!
 He shaved the space away.
 Th-The crystal's been destroyed. G Team wins!
 Did you all witness that elegant rampage?!
 I'm one with the wind!
 Bah-ha...
 As expected from the House of Vaude.
 How beautiful.
 Wow... That's Finral's younger brother.
 Could I cut magic like that with my sword?
 Bah-ha...
 In the end, you'll never be more than  a means of transportation, Brother.
 In our upcoming match, be careful not to  get in the way of my spatial magic, okay?
 I can't guarantee that you  won't lose something.
 If that were to happen,  Mother and Father aside,
 I'm sure that she would be sad.
 You're right.
 So to ensure that doesn't happen,  I'm going to win!
 How insolent of you, Brother.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 I Can See It!
 I Can See It!
 You're amazing, Finral!  You can see the whole battle!
 Your field of vision is huge!
 Well, I'm lucky enough to have  Captain Yami train me every day.
 Huh? What kind of training is that?!
 For example, after a meal...
 Heave ho, heave ho, heave ho...
 The way he's patting his belly...
 You must need to use the bathroom!  Right this way!
 Bathroom
 That annoyed way he's knocking on the door...
 Bathroom
 You must be out of toilet paper! Here you go!
 Other than that...
 Here's your paper!
 Here's your coffee milk!
 I'll make sure your mustache  looks wild enough!
 Not too clean-shaven and not too rugged!
 That's how it is.
 That's awesome!
 He's just getting used.
 You can't be serious.
 Hello, I'm here to dazzle you  with my beauty again.
 You were so beautifully happy  when I beautifully spread beauty
 across the battlefield  because I'm so beautiful.

76,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The first stage of the Royal Knights  Selection Exam continues to heat up!
 Asta and the others from B Team...
 Magna and the others from C Team...
 Finral and the others from E Team...
 Langris and the others from G Team...
 All these teams were victorious  and made it into stage two.
 In the end, you'll never be more than  a means of transportation, Brother.
 In our upcoming match, be careful not to  get in the way of my spatial magic, okay?
 I can't guarantee that you  won't lose something.
 If that were to happen,  Mother and Father aside,
 I'm sure she'd be sad.
 You're right.
 So to ensure that doesn't happen,  I'm going to win!
 Mage X
 Aw, man... I finally said it.
 I'm going to win!
 How insolent of you, Brother.
 I wasn't trying to make him angry, but...
 We will now begin round five!
 Finally!
 Hurry it up already.
 I Team and J Team, come forth.
 Hello.
 I hope you take it easy on us.
 Likewise.
 Pleasure.
 We're going to do our best.
 Roland, Wainsley, Nix...
 Nils, Ruben...
 And ""Times""? What a strange name.
 I believe it's just ""X,"" Asta.
 X?!
 What a strange name.
 I wonder if they entered anonymously.
 Um, pardon me...
 Yes?
 Who's this ""X"" that's on our team?
 We can't seem to find them anywhere.
 Huh?
 Hurry it up. If you can't find your other  member soon, I'm going to disqualify you.
 Um... X! X!
 If you're here, please come over immediately!
 X!
 Wh-Who the hell's that guy?!
 I'm X!
 The Captain of the Aqua Deer Rill Boismortier
 Hello! It's me, Rill Boismortier!
 Are you all surprised?
 The Captain of the Aqua Deer, Rill?!
 Why, though?
 The guy who uses paint  and picture magic?
 Why's a captain participating?
 You can't be serious!
 Huh? Wait... Were captains  not supposed to enter?!
 Not true! We're glad to have you!
 Yes! I get to see Rill's cool magic again.
 Hurry up and start, if you're all here.
 There's no need to be afraid, everyone.
 This is your chance to defeat a captain  and make a name for yourselves.
 True!
 With the rules of this game,  we actually have a fighting chance!
 The Aqua Deer were dead  last in the previous term,
 so I'm here to rebuild our reputation!
 I'm not going to be taken down so easily.
 What enthusiasm!
 I am deeply moved, Young Master Rill!
 A super-fast old guy just  popped outta nowhere!
 The Butler of the Boismortier Family Walter
 Ladies and gentlemen, I ask that you  take good care of Master Rill today.
 You're always so dramatic.
 Oh, hey, Asta!
 I look forward to today!
 Yeah! Let's both do our best!
 B-But he's a captain!
 Are you two friends?
 This old guy's scary!
 You must be Master Rill's  trustworthy friend, Master Asta.
 I've heard all about you.
 Where'd that come from?!  That was super smooth!
 Thank you for being good  friends with Master Rill.
 I am Walter, Master Rill's butler.
 Please, do have some tea.
 Th-Thank you very much.
 Th-This is...
 Asta?
 It's so classy that I can't  even understand the taste!
 Moron.
 Just imagine...  Master Rill having a friend.
 This would've been unfathomable before.
 Really? I guess I'm not that surprised.
 I do apologize. I've been moved to tears.
 Oh, come on, Walter!
 Stop bringing up the past! It's embarrassing.
 Oh, I do beg your pardon.
 We're going to begin, finally!
 All right! I'm going to paint  the best picture ever!
 What the heck does he mean by that?
 Round five of stage one!

 The Captain of the Aqua Deer...
 I wonder how powerful he is.
 Young master...
 Begin!
 U-Um... Captain Rill...
 The match has started.
 Isn't the sky beautiful?
 Huh?
 I wonder if I could get that  color if I used lapis lazuli.
 Did you know? You can grind up  precious stone and create blue paint.
 Right...
 For the white clouds, I'll use whitewash.
 Oh, whitewash is paint made from seashells.
 Fighting under such a beautiful sky  is the absolute best.
 All right, let's do this, you two!
 Let's create a beautiful piece  on this canvas known as the battlefield.
 Stay close!
 Here we go!
 C-Captain Rill...
 He dashed off on his own, but...
 I got captured!
 Hey... What the heck are you doing, Rill?
 He's a captain... right?
 Someone save me!
 He basically jumped right  into the enemy's trap.
 Well, this looks like it's  going to be over immediately.
 He easily fell for that trap spell.
 Is it really okay for us to defeat him?  Isn't he the captain of the Aqua Deer?
 No, a match is a match.
 We're going to give it our all and fight,  no matter who the enemy might be!
 Yes.
 You're right.
 Here we go!
 Plant Reinforcement Magic: Magic Pollen!
 Go!
 Flame Magic:
 Flame Spike!
 Ice Magic: Icicle Bridge!
 We're going to take down the  Captain of the Aqua Deer!
 Oh... What decisive and beautiful magic.
 The battlefield...  This canvas really is great.
 I feel the urge to create, Walter!
 4 Years Ago
 It's happened again.
 I wonder how many times  it's been just today.
 Ever since the young master from the House  of Boismortier received his grimoire,
 he's shut himself up in his room  and let his magic go berserk.
 He's always been a bit strange, but now, it's as though he's possessed.
 On top of that, he has a tremendous amount  of magic, so no one's been able to stop him.
 The master is quite troubled.
 How did he end up like this?
 Madam, please stay strong.
 He won't listen to a word I say.  He just keeps drawing and painting.
 That boy...
 That boy is beyond human understanding.
 He's a monster!
 No...
 It's all wrong, wrong,  wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!
 This isn't it.
 This isn't the picture that I want to draw.
 It has to be more... more...
 Please don't draw anymore, Rill!
 Why do you keep doing this?
 I should've... I should've...
 never given birth to you!
 You don't understand a thing about my art.
 You don't understand at all!
 Young master, may I have  a moment of your time?
 Shut up, Walter! Go away!
 Young master...
 Stay back!
 I can't draw or paint the way  that I want. It's not fun!
 It's boring!
 I told you to stay back!
 None of you understand my pain.
 Not you, not Mother... No one!
 None of you understand m—
 You finally see me, Young Master Rill.
 Walter...
 Does your cheek hurt?
 Huh?
 When people are wounded, they feel pain.
 That's why they're scared of getting hurt.
 They're afraid of what they don't understand.
 They don't want to go near it.
 If you wish to be understood,  then please try to understand others.
 You went through a lot of  trouble over these pictures.
 You want others to see them, don't you?
 That said, your talent is too great for  such a small canvas, Young Master Rill.
 It's far too great.
 It will be difficult for the people  around you to understand it.
 But that's what having such  prodigious talent is like.
 There is a canvas on which you can display  your magic to its fullest potential.
 Huh? What's that?
 The Magic Knights.
 The Magic Knights?
 Yes. Why not try to join?
 With your talent, I'm sure  you'll get in immediately.
 And there, you can draw  upon an endless canvas!
 You'll be able to draw  the ultimate masterpiece.
 The ultimate masterpiece?
 Yes.
 Okay, I will. I'll join the Magic Knights.
 I'm sorry, Walter. Are you okay?
 Oh, 'tis nothing but a scratch.
 Are you sure you don't want to say goodbye?
 Yup. I don't feel lonely.
 She's always smiling  within my heart's canvas.
 Indeed.
 Okay, let's go to the royal capital!
 To the Magic Knights Entrance Exam!
 I'm sorry, Rill.
 Have a safe journey.
 You let your talent blossom  after joining the Magic Knights
 and became the youngest captain in history.
 You are the pride of the  House of Boismortier.
 Yeah... This canvas is the best.
 I want to show Walter the ultimate picture first.
 After all, Walter is the  one who made me human.
 The young master's picture magic...  Its ability...
 Picture Magic: Twin Storms of Fire and Water!
 ...is to recreate every magical attribute!
 He attacked them with the attributes  they're weakest against at the same time!
 The stronger the opponent,  the greater his urge to create!
 The young master's imagination knows no bounds!
 Excellent work, young master!
 What?
 You guys were pretty good.
 But I haven't quite managed  the ultimate painting yet.
 Hup! Thanks.
 Oh, it was nothing.  You're amazing, Captain Rill.
 That was an intense attack.
 Sandstone Magic: Rock Storm!
 The crystal has been destroyed.  I Team wins!
 Well done, well done.
 I guess that was all right.
 We somehow managed to make  it through the first stage.
 Yeah... But what's he doing?
 I could've gone a little crazier over there.
 But the cobalt blue really stands out here.
 I've still got a ways to go.
 Um... Could you concentrate on the match?
 We're going to have to keep it together.
 He's rather irresponsible despite  being a Grand Magic Knight,
 so he has those around him work hard.
 That's the young master's true talent!
 What the hell is that?!
 Next, we will begin round six of stage one.
 K Team and L Team, step forward.
 It's our turn.
 Let's go, Captain Rill.
 We have to get on with the  next match, so please move!
 Of course. We're terribly sorry.
 We'll move him right away.
 Huh?
 Wait, what?
 Let go! I need to look at it longer!
 Come on!
 Are you done? Are you done now?
 Yeah! You're up next, Luck!  I'll be cheering you on.
 Don't you dare lose.
 Yup, thanks!
 It's finally our turn! I can't wait!
 Luck Voltia...
 This is a match that will decide  who will be among the Royal Knights.
 You need to take this more seriously.
 I am the leader. Make sure you  don't go running off on your own.
 Aw, don't be so serious. Let's have some fun!
 Oh, shut up!
 So these are my teammates.
 A crazy boy and a quiet,  straitlaced four-eyes.
 This can't be good!
 Honestly... Is this team going to be okay?
 Welp, there's no point in worrying about it!
 Let's give it our all!
 What?
 Who the heck are you?
 I'm your teammate.
 The Blue Rose Knights 4th Class Senior Magic Knight Puli Angel
 I'm Puli. Puli Angel.
 As my name and appearance suggest,  I'm an angel!
 Oh, I see. Nice to meet you.
 Let's hit 'em with our best performances!
 Yeah!
 Wh-What's with this chipper person?
 This is just...
 I have to remain the responsible one.
 You've got this, Klaus!
 Please do your best. I know  you can do it if you try.
 I won't consider you my senior if you lose.
 I see that you're as insolent as ever.
 Just sit back and watch my battle.
 Hey, let's come up with a plan.
 Indeed.
 The one we have to watch out  for the most in this match
 is their wind magic user, who's said to  be the most mobile member of his squad.
 A 2nd Class Senior Magic Knight from  the Silver Eagles, Rob Vitesse.

 I want to draw something more beautiful.
 You have a problem with me?
 Something beautiful...
 He's beautiful—wait...
 I want you to disappear so badly.
 Honestly, you can't be serious.
 I am the butler of the Captain of  the Aqua Deer, Rill Boismortier.
 You've grown so much, young master.

 And... begin!
 Bad Blood
 Things are getting pretty intense.
 Both teams are concentrating  their attacks at the center
 of the battlefield for a magic slugfest.
 Steel Creation Magic: Full Metal Fortress!
 Take this!
 His spell changed shape! That's awesome!
 He added a page to his grimoire  and evolved the spell.
 Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!
 How is his spell so destructive?
 As I thought... This isn't a junior-level fight.
 Luck and I have done tons of  missions over the last few months,
 and we've gotten tougher every time!
 Ain't no way we're still junior-level!
 He's always had intermediate skills,
 but apparently, he's gotten stronger.
 But that goes for me, too.
 Following Asta's example, I trained  my magic, my body, and my spirit!
 Even if my hard work may betray me...
 I will not betray my hard work!
 Steel Creation Magic: Blazing Spiral Lance!
 Way to go, four-eyes!
 Fantastic, Klaus!
 I guess you're not just some four-eyes  who's too serious and worries too much!
 Nice! After this fight is over,  you should fight me!
 Don't be stupid! Concentrate on this match!
 Here he comes... Rob Vitesse.
 He's left the crystal behind him.
 We'll bust through our three opponents  and destroy the crystal in a single rush!
 You got it!
 You know... You two are pretty good.
 Wing Magic...
 She's actually flying!
 Angel Flapping!
 That's an attack for the enemy...
 Go, Luck!
 And a tailwind for my allies!
 This is so much fun!
 All right! Break through!
 In the end,
 it's individual power differences that separate victory and defeat.
 My spell didn't even faze him.
 Not good... Crazy boy!
 More...
 He's fast.
 Let's play some more!
 In a single blow?!
 The crystal has been destroyed. K Team wins!
 Yes!
 They did it!
 Yay, yay...
 Man, that was so much fun.
 Luck! Y-You actually...
 Boom, boom! You two are fantastic!
 Yay!
 Luck!
 That bastard! You're getting  way too damn strong!
 Our next opponent...
 ...seems even more fun.
 ...seems like they'll help me make  an even better picture!
 Next up, the eighth and  final round of stage one...
 O Team and P Team, step forward.
 Which means it's finally...
 La!
 ...time for Yuno and Noelle's team!
 Finally, it's our turn.
 After we're done here,  you're going on a date with me!
 Whatever.
 The other guy....
 Let's... do our best.
 The Green Praying Mantises 4th Class Senior Magic Knight En Ringard
 Everything will be okay  if we work together.
 Are you okay?!
 Let's win... no matter what.
 Hey, is he going to be okay?
 No idea.
 And I heard that you grew up with Stupidsta.
 I hope you're not as reckless as he is, too.
 Look who's talking. You can't  control your magic well, can you?
 It looked like it took all  you had to maintain
 your Mana Skin at the volcano.
 Can you actually fight?
 Huh?! I'm royalty!
 Can you actually think and fight, you violent  peasant who's Asta's childhood friend?!
 What a noisy woman.
 That wasn't even an argument.
 That lame comeback...  Is Asta rubbing off on you?
 What?! Why would I ever  be influenced by him?!
 See?! You're just like Shtupidshta!
 Calm down. Guess I was right.
 I'm perfectly calm!
 Come on, you two, grow up.
 Learn to get along already.
 I think you might be the  cause of this, Asta.
 Who cares about you, Asta?!
 More importantly... Why don't  we come up with a plan?
 Who said you could touch me?!
 I see you're having a friendly chat.
 It's as though you think you  actually have the upper hand.
 The Black Bulls just happened to  make a good showing for once,
 and you really believe it was thanks to you?
 Solid...
 You can't control your magic, and despite being from the House of Silva,
 you couldn't even make it  into the Silver Eagles.
 And you're going to fight me?
 You're back again, shaggy bangs?!
 You failure!
 Why can't you do the same things  as us when you're also royalty?
 Trash! How dare you eat before me?
 Please stop, Solid. Please give that back.
 You can't protect what's important  to you because you're weak.
 Please stop!
 If you're upset, then get back at me.
 If you can actually hit me  with your spells, I mean.
 There you are, you thieving raccoon!
 The fairy dust! The fairy dust!
 Don't worry. You can do it.  We all worked so hard together.
 We're basically family.
 We know you way better than  that brother of yours.
 Now, believe in your friends  and yourself! Believe yourself!
 What's he mumbling about over there?
 Maybe he's cursing that  annoying brother of hers.
 Hey, what are you doing?
 We're up. Let's go.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Make sure you do your  best to run away, Noelle.
 Nyah, nyah, nyah!
 Let's finally end this!
 We will now begin the  eighth round of stage one.
 O Team: Sandler, Dimitri, and Solid  versus P Team: En, Noelle, and Yuno.

 You've got this, Yuno and Noelle!
 Noelle! Show them what the  Black Bulls' women are made of!
 Noelle! No need to hold back  just because he's your brother!
 I'll attack. You two support me.
 I'll attack.
 No, me.
 No, me!
 Me.
 Me!
 Then I'll support...
 This fast?
 Wait, what?
 This is an annoying way to do it, but it's  a shortcut with a simplified version
 of that compound magic from before.
 We'll end this instantly!
 They haven't moved their crystal.
 This isn't good. They closed the  distance to our crystal in one sprint.
 Wind Magic: Crescent Moon Sickle!
 Flame Magic: Combo Eruption!
 Water Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
 Look at you, learning a defense spell.
 Sand Magic: Suppressing Sand Mass!
 It's sucking up the water.
 At this rate, we'll spend the  whole match on the defensive.
 Hey! Who gave you permission  to cling to him like that?!
 I'm probably the fastest on this team.
 I'll take advantage of that  and go destroy their crystal.
 While I'm doing that, you two  somehow protect our crystal.
 Wait.
 Let me go.
 Please.
 None of you will be going.
 You go, Noelle!
 She's been fighting alongside Asta.
 I'm sure she can do it.
 It's safer if I'm the one  protecting the crystal, anyway.
 If I go...
 Hold it right there, Noelle!
 Solid's bound to come after me.
 Don't go off on your own!
 I'll be your opponent.
 Hey, did you hear about the  newbie with the four-leaf clover?
 He actually defeated one of the  Eight Shining Generals from Diamond!
 Seriously? That's insane for his first year!
 Not only that, but when he did it,
 he told the vice captain that he was going  to become the Captain of the Golden Dawn.
 Wow, that's wild!
 I guess you have to be on a different  level when the Wind Spirit chooses you.
 It looks like Captain Vangeance  has high hopes for him, too.
 You're saying you're going to guard  the crystal while dealing with me?
 That attitude is sheer insolence!
 Please come at me with everything you've got.
 Why you?
 Several Years Ago
 I wasn't expecting an ambush.
 As I was running, I fell deep into this cave.
 No one will be able to rescue me here.
 This is the end.
 Are you all right, Alecdora?
 He looked just like
 the figure in a painting  I saw when I was little.
 The figure of a god.
 I sensed you here.
 There's nothing to worry about now.
 Master Vangeance has some other  mysterious power besides magic.
 A warm power that seems to connect  him to his squad members.
 I swore that I'd devote my  grimoire to his service.
 I worked hard to ensure that the  Golden Dawn remained the strongest squad.
 We are an elite team of nobles  chosen by Master Vangeance.
 So why...
 Why is that peasant in our midst?
 Not only that...
 I can tell.
 Master Vangeance always interacted with  all his squad members equally, and yet...
 With that boy... With him...
 Yuno...
 He's called him by name five times today!
 Even though he hasn't even  spoken to me once yet!
 Why him?
 Is it because of his four-leaf clover?
 And that boy...
 The one Master Vangeance  expects great things from
 said that he would become captain himself.
 He's mocking Master Vangeance!
 Don't get full of yourself just because  you lucked into getting spirit magic!
 Getting chosen by me was  part of Yuno's power!
 That guy's pissing me off!  Let's get him, Yuno!
 Step back, Bell.
 Are you planning on fighting  without my powers?
 You can't just keep defending, Noelle!
 What are you doing?
 You're ruining our strategy! Both of us  are supposed to hit the crystal together!
 Shut up! Don't boss me around!
 Fine. I'll join you, and we'll defeat her in one—
 Heya.
 What the heck is this?!
 Fungus Magic: Running Mister Mushroom.
 I put some spores on you a little earlier.
 I won't let you get in Noelle's way.
 Too bad, Noelle.
 Now that I've caught up with you,
 you don't have a chance in hell  of scratching our crystal.
 I wouldn't be too sure about that!
 Relax. I's me, En.
 This is Talking Mushroom.  It lets you hear my voice.
 Who gave you permission to  stick this thing on me?!
 Now, now. More importantly...
 I heard Solid's remarks before the match.
 A big brother should never say  such things to his little sister.
 I have ten younger brothers and sisters.
 They're the ones I'm fighting for.
 Big brothers exist to protect the younger,  weaker siblings born after them.
 And yet you've only said  hurtful things to her!
 Get him, Noelle! Thrash your brother!
 Don't just give him an ordinary thrashing!  Make sure he never defies you again!
 R-Right... You sure are energetic.
 Humans are animals, too! Once you put  them in their place, they won't turn on you.
 Who's going to thrash whom, now?
 There's no way a failure  like you could beat me!
 That's right. I was weak.
 You've always been strong, so you probably  can't understand how weak people feel.
 At this point, I don't care if  you ever acknowledge me or not.
 Because even greater people  have acknowledged me!
 I used to be really scared  of your magic, Solid.
 But now, it feels really flimsy.
 Just keep running your mouth,  you embarrassment to the House of Silva!
 Water Creation Magic: Slashing Sea Serpent!
 How much more do you intend to insult me?
 Sand Creation Magic:  Sand-Armored Heavy Guard!
 This spell contains all the attack  and defense powers that I have!
 You think you can stop it  without your spirit magic?!
 I'm the one who will make  Master Vangeance's dream come true!
 Wind Magic: Towering Tornado!
 From the inside?
 What was that? He activated his  spell inside his opponent's spell?
 He can even do that? That's what  separates us from hot guys, dang it!
 I don't know anything about  other people's dreams.
 The only dreams I see are my own.
 Impossible...
 Impossible! You can't be serious!
 This can't be real!
 What's that spell?!
 You can't be serious!  Noelle couldn't cast a spell like that!
 Solid...
 It's all right if I hit you, right?
 Just go ahead and try it!
 It won't hit me! There's no way  her spell could actually hit me!
 You complete failure!
 Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Noelle!
 She destroyed the crystal in a single blow!
 The crystal has been destroyed! P Team wins!
 I'm not weak anymore!

78,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The sixth round of the first stage of  the Royal Knights Selection Exam...
 Steel Creation Magic: Full Metal Fortress!
 Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!
 Wing Magic...
 Angel Flapping!
 Go, Luck!
 This is so much fun!
 More...
 Let's play some more!
 Luck shows an extraordinary  amount of growth and teamwork,
 giving K Team their victory.
 In the eighth and final round  of the first stage...
 Time for Yuno and Noelle's team!
 Solid...
 A House of Silva battle  between Noelle and Solid...
 And a battle between Yuno,  who is favored by Vangeance,
 and Alecdora, who resents him over that fact. Two battles filled with bad blood.
 I'm the one who will make  Master Vangeance's dream come true!
 Wind Magic: Towering Tornado!
 I don't know anything about  other people's dreams.
 The only dreams I see are my own.
 Sea Dragon's Roar!
 The crystal has been destroyed! P Team wins!
 I'm not weak anymore!
 Peasant Trap
 Impossible...
 Im...possible...
 My ultimate spell was so easily...
 He didn't even use his spirit magic. He wasn't even serious.
 I will be the one to make Master  Vangeance's dreams come true.
 Once you elites trip up,
 you're so weak.
 Yes! Great job winning, Yuno!
 You too, weed.
 Who are you calling a weed?!
 Great job, Yuno!
 Y-You were so cool!
 Here's your usual after-battle dessert.
 Replenishing my energy is important.
 Thanks. I'll be sure to savor it.
 Thanks! I'll be sure to savor it!
 It's good.
 La...
 You okay, Miz Charmy?!
 La...
 What the heck?! Who do you  think you are, you fivehead?!
 I'll suffocate you by stuffing  my scales into your nostrils!
 Take that, and that, and that!
 She'll be fine.
 That was fantastic, Noelle.
 I didn't know you were that amazing.
 You're totally different when  you're using your mushrooms.
 But...
 I heard Solid's remarks before the match.
 A big brother should never say  such things to his little sister.
 Big brothers exist to protect the younger,  weaker siblings born after them.
 And yet you've only said  hurtful things to her!
 Get him, Noelle! Thrash your brother!
 Well, you know... Thanks for earlier.
 You did a great job.
 Hey, what do you think you're doing?!  I'm royalty, you know!
 Let's do our best in the next match, too.
 Thanks to my Mana Skin training,  I have much better control over my mana.
 I'm going to keep this up and be  selected as one of the Royal Knights!
 Wow, so many excellent matches.
 I can't wait until the next one!
 Entertain me more.
 To think both of the peasants who humiliated  me made it through the first stage...
 Hurry up and lose already.
 Why don't we jump right into stage two?
 But before that...
 I'm counting on you guys.
 Yes, sir!
 The stage is changing!
 Holy crap!
 It's easier to judge your abilities when
 you're forced to fight in a variety of situations.
 I'm back.
 Welcome back.
 Now, then... For stage two,  you'll be fighting upon this stage.
 Xerx
 Mimosa
 Asta
 Kirsch
 Sol
 Magna
 The stage may have changed,  but my beauty remains the same.
 Yeah, yeah...
 The same goes for the fate of you filth.
 I'll make sure there's no trace of  you left. I hope you're prepared.
 Hey, I'm not that easy to get rid of!
 Asta isn't filth!
 You're the one who should  be prepared, Brother!
 Asta! No holding back, you got it?!
 Wouldn't dream of it, Magna!
 At least you're spirited, Funglasquent.
 Stop calling me Funglasquent!
 Welp, looks like we're  facing off with royalty.
 Let's do our best with teamwork again, guys!
 You looked anxious when they  shifted the stage around.
 You probably have other  traps set up, don't you?
 This brat... That's right. He can read other people's ki or whatever.
 You're right. You see...
 I set up a bunch of traps  around the stage yesterday.
 I heard intel that the  exam would be held here.
 Intel? But the location of the Royal Knights  Selection Exam must've been top secret.
 Who in the world are you?
 You set them up yesterday?
 So you are cheating, you bastard!
 What makes you think that, you dumb shit?
 Gathering intel counts as an ability.
 Was there a rule against setting  traps up the day before?
 Well? They haven't called  me out on it, have they?
 And he already got argued into silence.
 This side of Asta is adorable, too.
 Then tell us where the traps are, since we're on your team!
 We can at least help you out!
 Not happening.
 If I tell you, our enemies  will probably figure it out.
 I can't... argue with that.
 I'll handle this my own way.
 Fine! Then I'll handle things  my own way, too, ya jerk!
 They seem to be arguing about something.
 I wonder if they'll be okay.
 They do say that the more you fight, the closer you are.
 You should fight with me, too,  someday. In a friendly way.
 Hopefully you can think up something  with that shitty little brain of yours.
 My brain's so big that my  skull can barely contain it!
 Indeed! The only thing small  about Asta is his height.
 Yeah! Hey, wait!
 And now...
 B Team: Xerx, Mimosa, and Asta  versus C Team: Kirsch, Sol, and Magna.
 Round one of stage two... Begin!
 Xerx   Mimosa   Asta
 B Team
 Magna   Sol   Kirsch
 C Team
 Mimosa... It seems she's  lost sight of herself after
 being exposed to such  boorish mana for so long.
 The poor dear.
 I'll free you from those filthy wretches  before you even have a chance to fight.
 Cherry Blossom Magic:
 Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals  ~Plus My Beautiful Illusion~.
 Ah, it's in full bloom.
 It's so pretty! Time for  a flower-viewing party!
 Here you go.
 Now, repent your filthy selves  within my beautiful spell!
 Here he comes.
 I talked big, but I can't think of  a way to break through this spell.
 It's better to sit tight for now.
 We're better off waiting for them  to set off the magic traps.
 What an awesome spell. I can't see a thing.
 I guess this is the only way.
 Asta?
 All right... Here it comes.
 Oh? Looks like something  amazing's about to happen.
 Good... That's it. Go even deeper.
 Asta?
 More... More intense...
 Wh-What is this? It's not magic...
 It's so powerful, intense,
 and...
 ominous.
 Here I go!
 Black Hurricane!
 The cherry blossoms... Wait, forget that! The traps I'd set up...
 A-Asta...
 This is from back then.
 So this is it.
 I knew he had been training ever  since he went to the volcano,
 but to think his power was this immense!
 Way to go, Asta, my BFF!
 The cherry blossoms are being erased!
 Impossible... What is  that horrific black mass?
 That little shrimp... blew away  all the magic in the area.
 Th-That's amazing, Asta!
 What the hell did you do, you little shit?
 I think I just heard the  real you for the first time.
 Come on! Let's fight together!
 You little shit.
 Th-This isn't beautiful.
 What is this?
 What in the world is going on?
 Asta's going to continue to get stronger.
 And so will I!
 Looks like Asta's learned  another interesting power.
 Here you go.
 What the hell do you think you're doing?
 You just erased all the traps I'd set up!
 Yeah, I guess that's a bit of a problem.
 So...
 Think up a strategy for us!
 One that'll let all three of us win!
 Huh?!
 You're tricky and clever, so I'm  sure you can think of something!
 From now on, think up some sneaky  strategies fair and square!
 The hell? That's a contradiction.
 Thank goodness. Asta is  acting the same as usual.
 Just use that power of yours  and defeat them yourself.
 Why do I have to do this?
 Too bad for you! Once I use that power,  I can't use it again for a while!
 Why do you sound so happy, you little shit?
 Are you messed up in the head?
 I want to fight as a team, ya jerk!
 I don't care if you set up traps yesterday!
 Just let Mimosa and me in on it!
 We're fighting to be selected  as the Royal Knights who'll
 fight against the Eye of the  Midnight Sun, aren't we?
 No one can fight them alone!  Not me or anyone else!
 I want to work with all the powerful guys  here and beat some other powerful people!
 Zora,
 the Magic Knights are amazing.
 But no matter how amazing they are,  even a Magic Knight can't fight alone.
 They trust their companions and  overcome deadly situations together!
 Besides, one of the powerful  guys we're up against now
 is royalty and the vice captain  of the Coral Peacocks!
 We have to hit 'em with all we've got!
 Ow! What the heck was that for, ya jerk?!
 I have no intention of  getting chummy with a royal.
 But for the sake of my goal...
 I can't think of any way around it,  so I'll use you, you little shit.
 That's fine with me, as long as we fight  together, you cool-masked jerk!
 As you know, my magic attribute is ash.
 My specialty is trap spells.
 But that doesn't mean I can instantly
 set up big traps like the one  I used in the last match.
 Setting big traps takes time and mana, and how much you put into them
 determines their power.
 Like I said, I pulled an all-nighter.
 You were serious about that?!
 And you went and thrashed them  all like they were nothing.
 Yeah... Sorry about that.
 What was I supposed to do, though?
 Let's see... There are three basic  types I could set up right now.
 Oh?
 Number one: binding traps.
 Whoever touches the magic  circle gets tied up.
 Number two: pitfall traps.
 Just like it sounds. Dig a hole  and drop someone into it.
 Number three: landmine traps.
 Make a simple attack spell  activate on a certain spot.
 They'll all disappear after one use,
 and unless I take the time to  pour lots of mana into them,
 they won't be all that powerful.
 So... What do we do?
 U-Unbelievable...
 My beautiful spell was defiled by  that peasant's pitch-black thing.
 I saw that coming.
 He'd been practicing his  techniques like crazy.
 I knew he'd figure something out.
 You're telling everyone not to  underestimate peasants, aren't you, Asta?
 I'm a peasant myself, but...
 What?! You're also a peasant?
 You got a problem with that, Mr. Royalty?
 Eek! I'm going to be defiled!
 I can't fight alongside a peasant!
 Hey, what the... Wait a sec!
 You damn narcissist!  The hell is your problem?!
 I can handle this on my own!  I'll finish them off myself!
 You two, protect the crystal!
 Is that so?
 Fine. I'll just do whatever  the hell I want, too.
 Jeez... Could men be any dumber?
 Peasants are those with meager magic.  That also means they're unclean.
 They must not share the same stage as  us royals, the fairest of them all!
 Mimosa is heading toward our crystal.
 I can sense that Xerx  fellow's magic over here.
 As for that filth, I sense  absolutely no magic from him.
 What kind of foul creature is he?
 Where did he...
 Hey, here comes Mimosa's big bro!
 There you are, you filthy boy!
 Cherry Blossom Magic: Dance of the  Beautiful Cherry Blossom Blades!
 Some got through those tiny little gaps!
 Man, you really are strong!
 Look at the unsightly way he's fleeing.
 You won't get away!
 Hey! Come get me!
 It's faint, but I sense magic.
 Is he trying to lure me into a trap?
 I can see right through your unsightly ploy!
 Cherry Blossom Magic: My Beautiful Clones!
 The traps!
 Did you actually think I'd  fall for such crude traps?
 And you went into a narrow place where  you'll have trouble swinging your sword,
 with no place to run. You couldn't be uglier.
 Damn it! I thought this  was a great plan, too!
 Wither and fall, you peasant!
 Wh-What is this?
 I'm certain I erased all of the trap spells.
 You moron!
 You keep counting on your magic detection 'cause it has higher specs than ours.
 That's why you fell for our low-spec,
 plain and simple trap that  we got all sweaty digging up.
 Some high and mighty royal.
 They physically dug this up  without using any magic?
 How unsightly! I'll just fly  right out of this primitive—
 I feel bad about doing  this to Mimosa's big bro,
 but I need you to pass out for a bit!
 Stay back, filth!
 Anti-magic?
 Now we finally feel like a team.
 I just used you, dummy.

 The Life of a Narcissist
 The Life of a Narcissist.
 Please do stop crying, Master Kirsch.
 Ever since he was born, he was  only interested in his own beauty.
 No, no, no. No one is more beautiful than I.
 He couldn't be satisfied with the  beauty of any of his wooers,
 so he spent his whole life single.
 Because of his warped personality,  he was abandoned by those around him,
 and spent his later years alone.
 I-I'm thirsty... Oh? I'm so beautiful.
 I'm still oh so beautiful.
 And so, his life came to a tragic end.
 Still, I'm so beautiful.
 I really wish I could make  you come to a tragic end.
 Who cares about teammates?
 I'm only using everyone  to achieve my own goal.

 It's the first round of stage two of  the Royal Knights Selection Exam.
 B Team was overwhelmed
 by Kirsch's extraordinary magical  powers as a royal, but...
 Black Hurricane!
 Asta used his black powers and  instantly nullified Kirsch's magic.
 At the same time, he nullified all the  traps set by the mysterious mage,
 setting the state of the match  back to where it began.
 I want to work with all the powerful guys  here and beat some other powerful people!
 I can't think of any way  around it, so I'll use you.
 The two worked together for the first time  and were able to lure Kirsch into a trap
 that was very appropriate for B Team, managing to strike him down.
 Now we finally feel like a team.
 Mister Delinquent vs. Muscle Brains
 According to the signal from  the Magic Flower Guidepost,
 the enemy's crystal is inside Sol's golem.
 If I mix the seeds of my magic-controlling  weeds into an attack spell and plant them,
 I'll be able to control Sol's golem for a  little while, since its attribute is earth.
 It'll take a while for the seeds to take root,
 and I'll have to fight and plant  the seeds without being noticed.
 I wonder if I can manage all of that.
 Plant Magic: Magic Cannon Flower!
 Not bad! But...
 Earth Magic: Clod Seal!
 Hurting women isn't my style,  so just take a little break there.
 Asta! Xerx!
 Let's see what Funglasquent can do.
 Looks like you got a bit overconfident  with your awesome magical powers,
 you damn royal.
 You actually fell for this primitive trap.
 You're seriously a vice captain?
 You should quit, you moron.
 How disgusting can you be,  you damn narcissistic dumbass?
 Not so beautiful now, are ya?
 Come on! The dude's out cold! Cut him some slack already!
 I'm amazed you thought of  making an actual pitfall.
 Talk about sneaky!
 I never thought I'd use my sword as a shovel.
 I'm more amazed at the fact that  you're somehow not worn out
 from digging a hole in so little time.
 You hyper, muscle-bound monster runt.
 Well, I train, so...
 Now, then... No matter how  gross he is, he's got skills.
 There's no telling what he'll do, so I'm gonna  set a magic circle near the entrance.
 So that's how you were setting them! That's so cool!
 Now if anyone tries to save this bastard,  they're gonna go kaboom.
 And, just in case, we should bury him alive.
 Hey!
 That's going way too far!
 My sword's in there, too!
 That noise... It's coming from over there!
 That voice...
 Flame Reinforcement Magic: Risky Stolen Base!
 Come on, come on, come on!
 I found the crystal, damn it!
 Magna, you're so fast!
 I'm not getting close enough  to let you fight, Asta.
 At this distance, I'm guaranteed to win!
 I'm gonna get some payback for your baptism!
 Don't think I'm the same  guy I was back then!
 Bring it on, Magna!
 Die!
 Okay.
 I can totally hit this!
 It's mine, Magna!
 Wha—
 Ya missed, you jackass!
 My new spell, Annihilation Massacre Fireball, is able to disappear!
 Ain't no way you're gonna hit it if I  make it disappear right in front of you!
 That spell's insane!
 You're amazing, Magna!
 That's so interesting!
 He's far more talented than he looks.
 He's amazing at barbecues, too.
 Even if I try to get closer to him,
 he's just gonna use that  super-speedy spell to run away,
 and that'll leave the crystal wide open!
 I'm gonna have to go black in order  to get close to him instantly.
 But I still need more time.
 Oh, crap! Mimosa! Come back!
 Hey, you little shit.
 Hang on for another ten... no, five minutes.
 Yeah! You got it!
 Hold it, you stupid brat!
 Did you see that, Mimosa?
 Even the tiny ones are criminals.
 The peasants' hearts are  as shallow as their wealth.
 They are vile inside and out.
 Those who are vile when they're young will  be forever vile, even when they're older.
 Hey, you okay? Wake up. Hey!
 I said wake up!
 You finally awake, narcissist?
 What do you think you're  doing to my beautiful face?
 You were plenty ugly before I slugged you.
 How dare you mock my beauty?!
 You aren't beautiful at all.
 Huh?
 The truly beautiful are people like my sis.
 Four Years Ago
 The Greatest City in the Common Realm Hecairo
 We're counting on you to look  after the city while we're gone.
 Sol Marron
 Leave it to me!
 I'll protect this town, so you guys  can go to work without worrying, Dad.
 I see Sol's as lively as ever.
 I'm pretty sure our town has some promising,  brave young lads, as well.
 Yeah! We're here, too.
 We'll protect the town  while you guys are gone.
 You can just go help out your mom, Sol.
 Huh? Who're the ones who were  crying and running around
 while some giant stray dog chased  after them the other day?
 I'm way, way stronger than all you guys!
 Still...
 You may be strong, but you're still a girl.
 We guys need to protect you.
 Wh-What?! I don't need your protection!
 But I'm a bit worried.
 They say there are some  bandits targeting towns
 that are far away from the royal capital.
 I heard they even attacked a town  on the outskirts to the east.
 Don't worry.
 Apparently, the bandits are almost  completely gone because of the Magic Knights.
 Contact the Magic Knights  if anything happens.
 They should get here immediately.
 Take everything that looks  like it's worth something!
 Take any women that look like  they'll sell for a high price!
 Hurry it up! We need to get the hell outta  here before the Magic Knights show up!
 Everyone, run to the church!
 What are you talking about?  You're coming, too!
 I'll be fine! Just go!
 Those cowards...
 Hey there, little girl.  It's dangerous over here.
 Well, aren't you a pretty little thing?  I'm sure you're going to get even prettier.
 Let's take her. Come on, now.
 If you don't resist, we'll be nice.
 Get out of my town!
 Well, she's a rowdy little one.
 Then I guess we'll just  have to use some force.
 Looks like we had a little mouse hiding.
 What's the matter? Not gonna run away, kid?
 You wanna save her? Or are  you too scared to even move?
 Well, if you want to save her, come on over.
 I mean, I'm just going to kill you, but...
 We guys need to protect you.
 I-I'm sorry!
 Aw, he ran away.
 Too bad, little girlie.
 Forget about that worthless kid.
 I'll teach you everything you need  to know about being an adult.
 Captain Charlotte went to protect  such a poor little town?
 The Wizard King said it, too! We need  to get over our differences and fight!
 That's right. Sis gave me the  hope I needed to keep living.
 Can you stand?
 Were you scared?
 I wasn't scared.
 I had every intention of  fighting and winning.
 I wanted to protect everyone...  to protect this town.
 It's just...
 I didn't stand a chance.
 I'm so angry... at how weak I am.
 I can't believe I trusted my friends.
 I'm so pathetic.
 How can I be strong like you?
 How...
 can I be beautiful like you?
 You are already beautiful enough.
 Now you just need to train  your body and your magic.
 You can become stronger.
 I'm sure of it.
 Become stronger, and join the Magic Knights.
 The Magic Knights? Me?
 I'll be waiting for you  with the Blue Rose Knights.
 Thank goodness you're safe.
 You—
 I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
 What are you apologizing for?
 I wasn't counting on you guys to begin with!
 I guess you guys saw my pathetic side, too.
 I was gonna take care of them with a single  blow, but I totally let my guard down.
 Next time, I'll definitely  protect you guys and this town,
 so don't you worry!
 Sol...
 I've made up my mind.
 I'm gonna get even stronger  and join the Magic Knights!
 And...
 I didn't get her name.
 Oh, well.
 Please wait for me... Sis!
 Don't you have a reason to fight  beyond your own selfishness?
 I missed again!
 It's too fast for me to pick up its ki, and  they're small enough that I keep missing!
 I don't have anything like  Asta's anti-magic sword
 or a crap ton of magic power to  let loose like some noble or royal.
 That's exactly why I came up with  this surefire technical spell!
 They might be small, but this  is how I'm gonna fight, dumbass!
 What the?!
 Yes! I finally hit one!
 Bring it on, Magna!
 You got it, you little shit! Die!
 Asta's not half bad after all,  that damn punk!
 You're hardly letting  any of them through now!
 He's still getting one out  of every five through.
 At this rate, the crystal's  not gonna hold up.
 You're so awesome, Magna!
 Magna and Asta are relentless. They're not letting up!
 Neither one of them knows  how to hold back. I love it!
 They look like they're having so much fun!
 Man, I'm so jealous! I wanna play, too!
 Asta, you really are incredible, you bastard!
 Thanks for... Thanks for making me and  the others stronger, you piece of shit!
 But Asta, the ones who'll be fighting in  the finals aren't you and that Yuno kid.
 It'll be me and Luck!
 What do you think you're doing without me?
 What the?! He's back!
 And it's ready.
 Wounding my beautiful face  is punishable by death!
 Crap! I'm not gonna be able  to take both of them on!
 Our crystal's gonna crack any second now!
 What should I do?
 Attack the cherry blossom  guy, you little shit!
 I don't know where your  spells are gonna pop up...
 So I put up a magic circle  on the crystal itself.
 My original spell is gonna knock your  phony imitation spell right back at ya!
 It can even mimic the effects?!
 My spell... is wicked awesome.
 Erasing magic, the beauty  of this world itself...
 Anti-magic. What a vile and atrocious power!
 I will not underestimate you again!
 Peasant brat, I will blow both you  and the crystal away from up here!
 Crap! If he goes up any higher,  I won't be able to block
 all the cherry blossoms,  even if I throw my sword up!
 He's gonna break the crystal!
 I don't care if it's a disgrace!  This is my full power!
 Wha—
 This is trap magic!
 You shouldn't let your magic  detection slide like that.
 I can set my trap spells mid-air, too.
 I'll take care of this in an instant!
 And that instant's all I need!
 Yikes... Twice in one match.
 You can't call that anything but humiliating.
 I'll make sure your sacrifice  won't be in vain!
 Wha—
 Crap! The crystal!
 Hey, what gives?! Move already!
 I made it... in time.
 Great job, Mimosa!
 Hey! Come on, listen to me!
 Hey, you idiot! Stop!
 It's mine!
 The crystal has been destroyed.
 B Team wins!
 That was so much fun!
 Both Magna and Asta were awesome!
 You both did great!
 We need to celebrate when we all get back.
 You're not afraid to go all-out  because you're true friends.
 All of you are true friends.
 We did it, Cool Masked Dude!
 See? I knew you could  handle teamwork, ya jerk!
 Hey, come on! Hey, what the hell?
 How long are you gonna leave me hangin'?
 So it ended up just like he wanted.
 Hey, come on! High five me!
 Come on, come on, come on, come on!
 This would've ended much quicker  if you hadn't busted all my traps.
 Come on, man!
 What?! High five me, damn it!
 Come on! Don't leave me hangin'!
 All right. Listen up, losers.
 Hey, giant girl in blue.
 You're too sloppy, dumbass.
 If you'd been more sensitive to subtleties  in magic, you might not have lost.
 The explosive delinquent over there latches  on too hard when he gets all fired up.
 I don't know if it's peasant grit or what,
 but you need to know when  to pull back, you moron.
 And Mr. Royal Narcissist over here...
 You're too damn proud all the time.
 You fell apart as soon as something  you'd denied struck back.
 You're the ugliest one here.
 Come on, that's going too far,  you jerk! Be a little nicer!
 Brother...
 Mimosa...
 It's true that sometimes poverty  makes peasants hard-hearted.
 But their true beauty is something  that can't be taken away.
 Don't look at me, Mimosa.
 Dun look at dis unsighdly brudder of yours...
 That was indeed a very unsightly loss.
 But you acknowledged a peasant's strength  and kept fighting, even as you got dirty.
 So right now, you're more beautiful  than I've ever seen you before.
 I didn't want to admit it, but...
 That was...
 beautiful.
 A royal losing to a peasant?  How unbelievably pathetic!
 Next, please prepare for the  second round of stage two!
 I'm up next!
 I'm not gonna lose either,
 Langris!

 Choosing a Lover for Sis
 Choosing a Lover for Sis.
 What? Who would I pick as a lover  for Sis out of these guys?
 This guy's way shorter than Sis,  so that's not happening.
 Delinquents are lame.
 There's no way I'm gonna let a  gaudy guy like that near Sis.
 Narcissists are gross.
 Guys who don't talk much are boring.
 Weak guys are a definite no.
 The Wizard King is one of the few I could  almost accept, but he loves everyone.
 I need someone who will only  love Sis and Sis alone.
 So that means I need a guy  who's taller than Sis,
 not a delinquent, not gaudy or a narcissist,
 who can have fun conversations with Sis,
 is strong, and will probably  love Sis and Sis alone...
 That means...
 There's no one other than me, Sis!
 Finral's next opponent is his  own younger brother, Langris.
 Be confident in yourself, and fight!

 Finral, you're not a loser.

80,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 It's the first round of the second stage  of the Royal Knights Selection Exam.
 Sol's attack left Mimosa unable to move.
 Asta was forced to face off with Magna,  who came to attack their crystal on his own.
 Also...
 What do you think you're doing without me?
 Crap! I'm not gonna be able  to take both of them on!
 The one who saved Asta was a  mysterious mage named Xerx.
 Attack the cherry blossom guy, you little shit!
 I'll take care of this in an instant!
 And that instant's all I need!
 With the help of Mimosa's plant spell that  lets her control the enemy's movements,
 Asta and the rest of B Team  were able to claim victory.
 And now, the destined battle between the brothers Finral and Langris is about to begin.
 Special Little Brother  vs.  Failed Big Brother
 There you go.
 Th-Thank you, Vanessa.
 That's perfect! You look awesome!
 Could you do mine, too?
 You already lost, though.
 It looks fine. You look like  the failure that you are.
 What?! Who're you calling a failure?!
 Now, now. Try to stay calm, Magna.
 Like a loser should.
 You bastard! I'm gonna kill you!
 I'm so gonna kill you!
 Good! Let's do this now!
 Wait, you guys—
 As I thought, that guy is a very  skilled flame magic caster.
 The lightning guy is also  one to look out for.
 I know.
 Luck is trying to cheer him up...
 La, la. Gimme more noms.
 My, aren't you a hungry little one?
 Marie... Marie... Always Marie.
 What's going on over there?
 The Black Bulls, huh?
 I guess bulls will be bulls.
 Come on, you guys, stop!  This is embarrassing!
 Why are you so stiff?
 I'm sure this next match
 will be complicated for you,  given who you're up against.
 Uh... Y-Yeah, I guess.
 Not to mention, I've never beaten  my little brother in anything.
 Don't worry.
 I've fought alongside you, so I know.
 You changed after meeting Asta.
 The same goes for me.
 I was able to face something hidden deep  within my heart that I'd been ignoring.
 You're not going to lose so easily now.
 Now get out there and show everyone  how cool you are. Just like your hair.
 Vanessa...
 You've got this, Finral!
 Don't lose like Magna, and come fight me.
 Yeah! Don't lose like—  The hell did you say?!
 I-I'm rooting for you, too!
 You've got this. You've got this. You've got this.  You've got this. You've got this. You've got this...
 You'd better not embarrass  the rest of the squad.
 Yeah.
 Charmy... Even Gauche.
 Thanks, you guys. I'm so happy  I joined the Black Bu—
 Please, more noms.
 I want to see Marie as soon as possible,  so win this in one second.
 But I have seniority...
 I'm sure Captain Yami's cheering  you on from the base, too.
 Yeah. He seemed a bit antsy this morning.
 He said his stomach was acting up, but...
 I'm sure he just wants to see you  work hard even without his help.
 Those guys must be going beyond their  limits and kicking ass right about now.
 I'm kicking ass, too.
 This one's gonna be a killer.
 And damn it, kid! I told you to  restock the damn toilet paper!
 Good grief. As if you could  actually defeat me, Brother.
 Langris, I managed to change  after meeting my friends.
 We'll be the ones who win this.
 Whatever. Don't blame me for  whatever happens, all right?
 Would you let me handle him?
 I don't see why not.
 A battle between brothers, eh?
 I also want to fight my  brother for real one day.
 I accept your passionate request!
 Bah-ha!
 I'm going to burn the image  of me gallantly riding
 my Shooting Star into everyone's eyes!
 You will not lay a single  finger on our crystal!
 It's finally starting!
 Now I'm getting nervous.
 Finral, I know you can win this.
 And now,
 E Team: Leopold, Hamon, and Finral  versus G Team: Langris, Fragil, and Sekke.
 Fragil
 Langris
 Sekke

 Round two of stage two, begin!
 You two concentrate on  destroying the enemy crystal.
 Leave it to me.
 Let's find out where it is.
 Glass Magic: Verre Détection.
 I can see every inch of this battle stage  as the light reflects off the glass.
 It will take a little while, but I will  definitely be able to find the enemy's crystal.
 I expect you to take me all the way  to the enemy base again, Mr. Bah-ha.
 Leave it to me! Also, I'm Sekke.
 Please call me Sekke.
 You can even call me Sek, bah-ha.
 Understood, Mr. Bah-ha.
 Bah-ha. No, really, it's Sekke!
 Please call me Sekke!
 You brought shame upon the House of Vaude.
 There's no way you can defeat me, Brother.
 You see, you aren't my child.
 So the only one that I love  is my dear little Langris.
 Mother, it's a bit cruel to be so blunt.
 What is that pathetically weak spell?
 Learn from Langris's attack spells!
 Goodness.
 I see my dear little Langris is better  than you at both academics and sports.
 You're so amazing, my dear little Langris.
 As I should expect from my own child.
 What are you doing, Finral?
 You disgrace the Vaude name!
 How pathetic. He's older than me, but there's  not one thing he can do better than me.
 What? A fiancée?
 Yes.
 Finnes Calmreich
 This is Lady Finnes, the fiancée of  the next head of the House of Vaude.
 Good day to you.
 Her chronic illness keeps  her from going out often,
 but the king is her great uncle,  so she comes from a prestigious family
 and has splendid magic.
 So basically, in the future,  this woman and I will...
 Ugh. What a dull-looking woman.
 My dear little Langris,  make sure you get along with her.
 She's going to be your bride someday.
 Of course!
 Seriously... When I become  the lord of this house,
 I'll be able to bring us fame  like they've never seen.
 Ugh... I'm so bored.
 I'm very sorry that you got stuck with a  fiancée who's sickly and older than you.
 N-Not at all!  You're b-b-beautiful, Miss Finnes.
 It's just... I'm not the one who'll become  the next head of the House of Vaude.
 Huh?
 My little brother is better  at everything than me,
 so he'll be able to make you happy.
 His magic is amazing,  and he's a very decisive person.
 I'm just a failure.
 Exactly. There's not a single  thing he can beat me i—
 That's not true.
 Huh?
 I've only met you a few times, but I can tell.
 You're a very kind person.
 To me, you're a much more  wonderful mage, Finral.
 O-Oh, stop! D-Don't tease me like that!
 Oh, but I wasn't teasing you at all.
 Who do you think you are, you dull woman?
 You have the nerve to call me  inferior to my brother?
 Don't be ridiculous.
 That loser left the family because  he couldn't handle the pressure.
 He's not better than me at anything! Not a single thing!
 Bah-ha! Found it!
 Here he comes. As we planned,  we'll leave him to you, Finral.
 Just as a reminder... Don't blame me if you lose any limbs.
 I'll end this in a single blow!
 What?!
 I tested this out earlier with another  spatial magic user, Cob, and found out...
 that when spatial magics collide,
 the mana currents collide  and cancel each other out!
 Langris, we're the ones who are going to win!
 Th-That's awesome!
 You can cancel out spatial  magic with spatial magic?
 Way to go, Finral!
 H-He's like a completely different person!
 Keep it up, ya jerk!
 Marie's waiting. Hurry up and win.
 I get to have more yummy noms, la!
 Bah-ha, ha-bah?!
 Excellent work, Finral! That was effective!
 Hamon, where's the enemy team's crystal?
 I've finally found it!
 It's deep within that tower.
 All right, I'm counting on you two!
 Th-This isn't good, bah-ha!
 Who do you think you are, Brother?  I'll remind you of your place!
 Give it up!
 You came in.
 This is...
 Snow Magic: Phantom Snow Garden.
 This spell forces your senses to sleep.
 You cannot attack me effectively any longer.
 I'm not tired at all... This is nothing!
 Especially compared to my older sister's  training, which could leave you dead!
 Honestly, you still have much to learn.
 Yeah! You're so valiant, Hamon!
 I can still eat plenty...
 You're talking about yourself?!
 You should give up and fall asleep, too.
 This is...
 I swore upon the symbol on my forehead...
 that I would surpass my brother someday!
 And that means I can't lose in a place like this!
 Concentrate!
 Mana Skin!
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 His senses are sharp!
 He enveloped himself in mana  and canceled my spell.
 More! I need to concentrate more!
 I won't last much longer, Langris.
 Bah-ha!
 A spatial magic battle!  You don't see that every day!
 Ah, so that is Finnes's fiancé, Langris.
 Not bad at all.
 He's still no match for me, though.
 Keep it up, Finral!
 It's only a matter of time before  their crystal is destroyed!
 I never thought you'd become  my natural enemy, Brother.
 Do you plan on defending  until our crystal breaks?
 I'm not sure that'll be so easy!
 It might not be. That's why...
 I'm going to use a new spell!
 Bah-ha! What in the world is that slow spell?
 Like you could hit my badass self right now!
 What? Homing?
 That's no match for my invincible  Sekke Magnum Cannonball!
 H-He disappeared?!
 This is pretty pathetic, even for me.
 I trained so hard, but I never  could learn a single attack spell.
 It's not an attack spell?
 Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat.
 It follows the enemy,  and once it makes contact,
 it transports them to another location.
 It's the applied version of  the spell I usually use.
 This way, he can get rid of  enemies without hurting them!
 He must be a kind soul.
 You're so awesome, Finral!
 B-But where did he go?
 It just went back in. Can I kill you now?
 Bah-ha... I'm dead.
 Langris, it's only a matter of time  before your crystal is destroyed.
 I don't want to hurt you!
 If you insist on continuing, I'll have  to use this spell to make you leave.
 Who are you worried about?
 You constantly get on my nerves, Brother.
 Who would've thought that our special  reserve spells would be similar?
 How dare you make me use my grimoire's magic?!
 There isn't a single thing  you can beat me at, Brother!
 Th-This ominous feeling...  I've felt this somewhere before!
 Th-This mana...
 This is...
 This doesn't feel very pleasant.
 As I figured...
 It's over, Brother!
 Langris!
 Th-This immense magical power...  I already know I don't stand a chance.
 But this is...
 This nauseating magic is like...
 Who are you?
 Finral!
 If that attack hits him...
 Run!
 No. He's Langris.
 He's my little brother.
 You may not like it, but we're similar.
 Our mothers are different, but in the end...
 I never did anything that made  me seem like a big brother.
 I left our family and tried  to forget everything.
 But I just couldn't.  Langris, no matter what you think...
 You're my little brother!
 Langris, stop it! If you keep this up,  I have a feeling you won't be you anymore!
 What could you possibly  know about me, Brother?
 You left everything behind!
 You're a coward who can't even hurt people!
 Don't you dare try to act  like my big brother now!
 I'll stop you!
 Finral!
 G-G Team wins!
 How do you like that?  There's nothing you can beat me at!
 Young Master Finral is so friendly and kind,  isn't he? He has a lot of friends, too.
 Young Master Langris is... Well, it's obvious  that he looks down on people, you know?
 To me, you're a much more  wonderful mage, Finral.
 Even I want someone that kind to...
 Langris!
 Working too hard all the time  hurts after a while, doesn't it?
 Come goof off with your  big brother once in a while!
 There's a festival going on nearby!
 Why is he nice to me, too?
 Stop it.
 Learn from Langris!
 My dear little Langris is so amazing.
 I'm better than you are. That's why  Mother and Father are kind to me.
 I have to beat him at everything!  Otherwise, I'll... I'll...
 Hey, the match is over.
 Wh-What's he doing?
 Disappear.
 Finral!
 These wounds are awful.
 At this rate...
 Hey!
 Just try and do something else.
 Forget the match. We'll kill you.
 You bastard...
 How dare you do that to Finral?!
 Th-This is too awful!
 You actually pissed me off.
 I won't forgive you!
 Oh?
 There's something wrong with you!
 The match was already over!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Hairstyle
 Hairstyle.
 That new spell is awesome!  Fallen Angel's Weightlifting!
 That's Fallen Angel's Wingbeat.
 I mean, I know when I need to get tough.
 It's the result of trying different things.
 So is your new hairstyle also  from trying different things?
 Oh, really?
 Huh? Wait, no...
 I'm sure you tried out a regent pompadour.
 As well as Captain Yami's hairstyle.
 And soft serve hair, la!
 That's poo—
 This looks pretty strong!
 If you do Marie's hairstyle, I'll kill you.
 I-I like this hairstyle.
 I think this one is better.
 I-It's just a better option, that's all.
 How about something a bit more mature?
 This is the hairstyle for when  you go beyond your limits!
 Uh, seriously...
 I wanted to see this  hairstyle on you, Finral!
 When it comes to me in this series,  my hair should be the least of your worries!
 Praise me!
 Your daring and resolute king presents...

 The Life of a Certain Man
 In the second stage of the  Royal Knights Selection Exam,
 the battle between E Team and  G Team was growing intense.
 Leopold from E Team approached  G Team's crystal,
 and Langris from G Team was also  getting closer to E Team's crystal.
 It's over, Brother!
 Langris!
 I'll stop you!
 What a nice cold dessert.
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 Snow Magic: Unclimbed Ice Wall!
 Yes! We did i—
 G Team wins!
 G Team's crystal was also destroyed,  but E Team's crystal was destroyed first.
 Thank goodness. Langris must've  gotten to it first.
 Oh, dear. What happened?
 Damn it! We lost! I wasn't  concentrating enough!
 Does this mean I'm still nowhere  near my brother's level?
 This ominous magic...
 It's coming from where Finral is.
 What in the world is happening?
 How do you like that?  There's nothing you can beat me at!
 What?
 Miz Charmy!
 Cotton Creation Magic: Fluffy Sheep Cushion!
 Disappear.
 Hey!
 Just try and do something else.
 Forget the match. We'll kill you.
 There's something wrong with you!
 The match was already over!
 Maybe you've been on a roll lately,  but you're still Black Bulls flunkies.
 What do you think you'll do against  the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn?
 Who the hell cares about status when we're  trying to protect our precious friend?!
 Precious friend?
 That's enough.
 Those who go easy on their companions  in a fight can't be trusted.
 But those who try to kill their  companions have problems
 that run much deeper than trust.
 He's in bad shape. Leave him to me.
 Dr. Owen!
 Water Recovery Magic:
 Qualle Operation.
 Will he be okay?
 I'll do everything I can.
 Companion? That useless fool brings  shame upon the Magic Knights.
 You little...
 Let's kill him after all.
 Finral's nicer than anybody!  That's what makes him a true Magic Knight!
 No matter how tough you are,  you're no Magic Knight!
 I'm not a Magic Knight? What?
 I guess making it this far  has gone to your head.
 You sure talk big for a Black Bulls newbie.
 Wizard King, before the next  teams conduct their match,
 would you let me battle them?
 Actually... Let's just start.
 Why, you—
 Asta!
 Let the semi-finals begin!
 You little—
 Asta!
 Vice Captain Langris has always  been a bit belligerent,
 but it's not normal for him to act like this!
 Yes. Something definitely isn't right.
 Sir, aren't you going to stop them?
 In actual combat,  no one says ""stop"" or ""start.""
 So keep going.
 You were with him then...
 I disliked you from the first time we met.
 You belong to the worst  possible Magic Knight squad,
 Asta of the Black Bulls!
 That's my line, you jerk...
 Vice Captain Langris Vaude  of the Golden Dawn!
 Time Binding Magic: Chrono Stasis.
 You two can hear me, yes?
 Although I'd like for you two to fight as if  this were real combat, it is still a match.
 Sit tight for a long second,
 until preparations for the  match are completed.
 Don't worry. I'll have everything  ready before your enthusiasm cools.
 Prepare for the semi-finals.  Get the crystals ready.
 Y-Yes, sir!
 Also, bring the other members  of B Team and G Team here.
 Roger-dodger-roger! Um...
 B Team has Xerx Lügner  and Mimosa Vermillion.
 G Team has Fragil Tormenta
 and Sekke Bronzazza.
 Now, then...
 I need to make sure to thank you  for interrupting my golden time.
 Y-You don't need to thank me-ha.
 Now, there's no need to be shy.
 Pardon me.
 Dark Magic...
 Dimension Slash!
 What in the world?!
 His heartbeat is getting weaker.
 Finral!
 I'll never forgive you if you die!
 Yeah! If you're going to die,  I need to kill you first!
 Wake up! Don't make me set you on fire!
 It'll be okay. I know that  he's really strong deep down!
 Today won't be the last entry in  my observation journal for you!
 That's a long way off!
 If you die, you won't be able  to eat delicious noms, la!
 You can make it through, la!
 To think that's what was going on...
 Must've been rough.
 My eternal rival, Asta! Don't lose!
 Have fun!
 I thought we won.
 Asta...
 What's going on?
 Huh? What's Asta doing here?
 The semi-final round  between B Team and G Team.
 We've already set up your crystals  at your starting positions.
 What? We're starting the semi-finals already?
 Let me just remind you that this is a match.
 Whichever team can destroy
 the other team's crystal first wins.  It's not about killing your opponent.
 I wish you luck.
 Mimosa, Xerx, I'm sorry about this.
 I didn't mean for this to happen,  but I want to beat him!
 Please, help me!
 Of course!
 There's something wrong with Langris.
 Xerx?
 Magic Knights clashing over personal stuff  and doing whatever the hell they want...
 Are you all stupid?!
 Hey!
 But fine, whatever.
 For now, he's much worse than you.
 Let's do this, you little shit!
 Langris...
 What's going on?
 Kindly explain, bah-ha.
 Shut your mouths.
 Bah-ha! Ha-bah, ha-bah...
 You shouldn't talk to us  like that. Don't worry-ha.
 Next time, I'll use my magic to—
 There's no need.
 Bah-ha?
 All of you are absolutely worthless.
 I'll show you all that I'm special!
 Unconscious betrayal?
 Yes. Based on the circumstances  up to this point,
 it seems someone  among the Magic Knights
 is unwittingly cooperating with  the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 I can't help but feel like  there's someone like that.
 So they're being controlled  by some kind of spell?
 No... It's not a spell.
 I wonder...
 Maybe it is a spell.
 He always leaves work undone to go  on his little trips to observe magic,
 but his intuition is sharp.
 There must be something going  on with the Magic Knights.
 My other goal with this  Royal Knights Selection Exam
 is to bring this unconscious  traitor to light.
 Huh?
 When they expend their  mana on the battlefield
 or when they're confronted by powerful mana,
 people tend to show their true colors.
 But won't that be dangerous?
 No.
 We're doing this.
 Does this mean that Langris  is the unconscious traitor,
 Wizard King?
 Let's go after the enemy's crystal
 while protecting our own,  like we did in the first stage!
 Mimosa, could you pull the crystal?
 Right!
 I need you to back me up, Xerx!
 There has been a change of plans.
 Sekke   Langris   Fragil
 G Team
 Xerx   Asta   Mimosa
 B Team
 We will now begin round  one of the semi-finals.
 B Team: Xerx, Mimosa, Asta versus  G Team: Langris, Fragil, and Sekke.
 Begin!
 They handled that quickly.
 His anti-magic sword can cut the  crystal in two with a single slash.
 Which means...
 I just have to break you and your crystal
 before you can get to ours!
 These don't suddenly change like  Magna's attack, so I can cut these.
 But there are so many of them!
 Recovery Magic: Princess-Healing Flower Robe!
 Thanks, Mimosa!
 It's only a matter of time before your  recovery spells aren't fast enough!
 Before that happens, take back what you said!
 Come on! Asta's doing his best out there!
 You need to keep fighting  so you don't get laughed at!
 That cowardly loser isn't a Magic Knight!
 I won! That makes me the true Magic Knight!
 You didn't even hesitate  to abandon the people!
 Oh, well. They'll just have to be noble  sacrifices for the sake of our country.
 Give me a break!
 Finral has always used  his magic to help others!
 So what, you naïve little brat?!  That's all he can do!
 He was never strong enough  to defeat his enemies!
 Asta!
 I can't...
 The one who wins in the end is the  one who's right about everything!
 Is that so? In that case, I'm right about everything!
 What?
 Because I'm going to win  for Finral's sake, too!
 Oh, please.
 Asta!
 Don't give up, no matter what!
 Asta!
 This is no longer a match.
 What's going to happen in  this battle, Wizard King?
 My recovery magic can't keep up!
 Asta! Any more of this and your body  will break down before the crystal does!
 We—
 Not yet!
 The side effects of my black form...
 The intense pain in my muscles and bones...
 My cool-down period is over.
 Right now, I'm only able to go  into that state twice a day.
 I was planning to save it for  when I fight Yuno in the finals,
 but I can't afford to think like that now!
 Still, in order to go into that state,
 I need to concentrate and  make my ki circulate.
 In these circumstances,  that's going to be impossible.
 So...
 It's all you, Xerx!
 You dumbass!
 Like I'd take orders from you.
 Xerx!
 I'm only doing this because  I don't like that guy.
 Yet this dumbass is actually  putting all his trust in me.
 Damn it.
 Zora! Zora!
 Zara Ideale
 I'm home, Zora.
 Welcome home, Dad.
 Did you behave—Whoa! You did  all the housework perfectly again!
 Thanks for everything you do, Zora.
 My father was a very cheerful person.
 You stink!
 My father loved practical jokes.
 You fell for it, Zora.
 And he always laughed like a child.
 Boom! The envoy of justice,  the Super Magic Knight Zora!
 What is this?
 It's a doll I made.
 You made this?
 Super Magic Knight Zora has a mouth  on him, but he's as good as his word.
 He's a warrior who protects  the country behind the scenes!
 Well? Isn't he cool?
 I'm twelve years old, you know...
 I'm not saying you have to match this.
 I just think you should learn to  communicate with others more, Zora.
 Right...
 All right, then.
 I'm gonna go protect the peace again.
 Zara was the first peasant  to become a Magic Knight.
 From the age of fifteen,
 he failed the Magic Knights  Entrance Exam over and over.
 But despite getting older and  becoming a father, he never gave up
 and worked harder than anyone.
 All of Zara's hard work  shone in Zora's eyes.
 And he was prouder than anyone when  his father became a Magic Knight.
 I ended up alongside this amazing  guy on the battlefield today.
 He could use time magic.
 He's the kind of guy who's gonna succeed.
 I get to protect the country with a  bunch of amazing people like that.
 Man, being a Magic Knight is awesome!
 We all believe in each other and get  through life-or-death situations!
 I'm going to continue protecting everything  I can with all the power that I have.
 That's what makes a Magic Knight!
 How are you going to protect  anything if you're dead, Dad?
 Those are... Magic Knights  from the Purple Orcas.
 They're Dad's companions.
 They must've come to pay their respects.
 Too bad, Zara Ideale.
 A peasant trying to pass himself off
 as a Magic Knight on the battlefield?
 That's why you got nailed in  the back by one of your own.
 I mean, the insolence of a mere peasant  thinking he could get along
 with nobles like us...
 Buzzing around saving civilians  on the brink of death...
 You were an eyesore, you piece of trash.
 No one wants a filthy Magic Knight like you.
 Y-You people...
 You call this a VIP room?
 We're Magic Knights here!
 Bring us your best alcohol!
 B-But...
 What? You don't want to pour me a drink?
 Th-That's not...
 I guess I'll have to punish you  for that attitude of yours.
 Sir... Please forgive me!
 Good job. This is making the  alcohol taste a little better.
 Well, hello there, Magic Knights.
 I'm about to get in your way.
 Huh?
 Who the hell are you?
 Just try and arrest me for  obstructing public duties!
 You people...
 You people...
 You people...
 You people...
 You people...
 They said my granddaughter  who lives in the town of Poe
 was taken away by you and hasn't been back.
 Please... Please give me  back my granddaughter.
 Lord Xerx is exhausted after a long  expedition! Stay back, you old hag!
 Please... Please, Sir Magic Knight!
 You people...
 Would you like to beautifully lose what  little life you have left with my magic?
 Don't you dare defy the Vice Captain of the  Purple Orcas! He's the Saint of Pure Ice!
 Who are you?
 You people...
 You people...
 are not the Magic Knights  that my father dreamed of!

 Golden Time.
 Golden time.
 Golden time.
 Golden time.
 Golden time.
 That's my very precious  and irreplaceable time.
 If someone is stupid enough to disturb it...
 This is what happens.
 You should all be careful. Bah-ha...
 Lalala-di-la!

 we're going to make sure you stuff  yourself full of extra yummy goodness!

82,"Black Clover is about to begin.
 In the semifinals of the Royal  Knights Selection Exam,
 Asta's B Team and Langris's  G Team were battling it out.
 One fierce blow after another...
 One intense blow after another...
 One battle to the death after another.
 You people...
 are not the Magic Knights  that my father dreamed of!
 Meanwhile...
 Charmy had left the venue in order  to find some ingredients so that
 she could make something yummy  for Yuno and the Wizard King.
 But she accidentally bit into  a hallucinogenic mushroom
 and dreamed a strange dream.
 La...
 It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by Charmy the Demon.
 But a single piece of meat saved them all.
 It's so nummy, la. So yummy, la!
 Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...
 This is bliss, la!
 Now that I'm full, I'm tired, la.
 The bone's meat was able to sate the demon, and it became a legend.
 This is a really famous legend,  so you've all heard of it, right?

 Amazing!
 So there aren't seven transformations?
 The Mystery of the Grimoire
 The Mystery of the Grimoire!
 Wait, what? We're small now?
 But man... Our grimoires  are totally different.
 He ignored me?
 A grimoire's size and thickness are  determined by its owner's style.
 All right! Let's compare grimoires!
 No.
 That thing's filthy
 No fair!
 You scared you're gonna lose?
 Not a chance.
 You're getting a big head just because  you're a little handsome, aren't you?
 Not a chance.
 Asta  VS The Anti-Birds!
 Asta vs. the Anti-Birds.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Hey! Get away from me! Buzz off!
 Whoa! Hey! What the heck are you guys doing?!
 Hey, Yuno! Ow, ow, ow! Help me!
 Unbelievable...
 Who's the Most Similar?
 Who's the Most Similar?
 The winner is...
 this bird.
 What?!
 Cringing at Salamander Bowls
 Cringing at Salamander Bowls!
 Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!
 Mander!
 How adorable!
 That's no big deal! Nero's much cuter.
 If you put him in a bowl, he's delicious.
 Ma?!
 She's dangerous!
 Looks nummy!
 They're all dangerous!
 Honor Me
 Honor Me.
 I am Noelle Silva, and I am a royal (ouzoku).
 A bandit (sanzoku)?
 Who are you calling a bandit?
 I'm a royal.
 A pirate (kaizoku)?
 Who are you calling a pirate?
 I'm a royal!
 Family (Kazoku)?
 Y-You idiot...
 Look at Me!
 Look at Me!
 Hey, Stupidsta. Look at me!
 How do I look in this swimsuit?
 You're all sparkly.
 Isn't it heavy?
 That'd probably work great as part of a scarecrow.
 You sort of look like a cow back in Hage...
 Crab!
 Wh-What are you staring at?!
 Crab!
 But you told me to look!
 Ugh, I'm so embarrassed...
 Crab...
 Voice Change
 Voice Change.
 M-Marie's coughing?!
 Did you catch a cold?
 It was pretty cold in the cave!  Are you all right, Marie?
 Yeah, my throat's just a little sore.
 Huh?
 My voice sounds strange.
 M-My angel Marie's voice  sounds like Captain Yami's!
 More importantly, Brother,  go save Asta and the others!
 Take my magic.
 The old hag's voice is weird, too?
 I may only be able to use  my magic one more time.
 You, too, Finral?!
 Wait, now my throat is...
 Your voice is cute!
 Marie's in Danger
 Marie's in Danger.
 All right, one, two, three!
 Marie! Are you an angel?!
 I can do anything when Marie's around!
 But there are times where I must steel  my heart and decline Marie's wishes.
 For example!
 Brother, go back and save  Asta and the others!
 No! Going back would put you in danger!
 Brother! I want to eat some  hot, extra-cheesy doria!
 No! Eating that would put  your tongue in danger!
 You'll burn it.
 Brother, doesn't lying  out in the sun feel nice?
 No! If you're in the sun too long,  your skin will be in danger!
 UV rays are a fearsome enemy!
 Brother, show me a really cool spell!
 No... Just kidding.
 Marie, look at me.
 Mirage Brigade!
 You're amazing, Brother!
 No... Now I'm... in danger.
 Brother? Brother? Brother?
 Double Gauche
 Double Gauche.
 Brother!
 Spin me around like Asta did!
 I'll... kill him!!
 Spin... Marie around?!
 Brother?!
 I can't disappoint Marie...  I'll have to rely on my clone...
 Mirror Magic: Real Double!
 Spin her around...
 I can't put Marie in danger.
 That's true!
 Then I'll just have to do it for her.
 See? We're spinning!
 You're not doing it right.
 What's Mana?
 What's Mana?
 Asta, do you know what mana is?
 Yup!
 Mana
 It's written like this!
 Mana
 It's written with the same  character for ""magic""!
 Serious
 These both mean ""serious""!
 Yes. Mana is a powerful energy  that exists in this world.
 Yup! And everyone has it...
 Except me!
 Mages use up their mana to use magic.
 That's why if they run out of it,
 they might not be able to use  magic again until they recover.
 Do you understand?
 Yes!
 What a lovely flower!
 Perfect for giving to a girl.
 Finral!
 Wow, you're so aggressive!
 I've never met a flower like you!
 Crackling Magna Typhoon!
 Crackling Magna Typhoon! 
 Hey, everyone! How are you doing?
 We can't hear you! Put a little  more umph into it, damn it!
 Today, we're going to show you how you can  do an easy Crackling Magna Typhoon at home.
 First, have a string of lightning ready.
 No one can do that!
 Then, you wrap that lightning  string around Magna, like this.
 It's electrocuting me!
 Oh, you'll have to get your own Magna.
 They can't do that, damn it!
 Once you wrap the lightning  string around him,
 you're going to spin him with  all your strength like a top.
 Just like this! Take that!
 And that's the Crackling Magna Typhoon.
 Easy, right?
 You're the only one who can do this, damn it!
 Save me!
 See you next time!
 Real Life! Magic Knights 24!
 Real Life! Magic Knights 24!
 It's chilly.
 Right, Mister Yami!
 It's hot!
 Right, Mister Yami!
 I can't see anything.
 Right, Mister Yami!
 Get out.
 Right, Mister Yami!
 Sekke's Bah-Ha Seminar
 Sekke's Bah-Ha Seminar!
 Bah-ha!
 Bah-ha.
 Wrong! It's...
 Bah-ha!
 Bah-ha!
 Asta, you have yet to learn  the ways of the bah-ha.
 Bah-ha!
 The ways of the bah-ha?!
 Sekke's Bah-ha Seminar! Part 2
 Sekke's Bah-ha Seminar, Part 2!
 We're still doing this?
 But of course, Asta.
 You haven't learned the  ways of bah-ha at all yet.
 Your Shooting Star's pretty cool!
 Ah, so you understand how grand it is!
 That part in front is especially awesome!
 Good. You are starting to  understand the ways of bah-ha!
 I see. So that's bah-ha.
 Yes. Starting today, you  have attained bah-ha!
 Bah-hahaha! Bah-hahaha!
 Bah-hahaha!
 Men are so stupid.
 My Magic
 My Magic.
 I'll show you my magic. It's hex magic.
 In the next ten minutes...
 you'll blink.
 Let's Gordon!
 Let's... Gordon...
 I'm right behind you.
 Magical Detective Charmy
 Magical Detective Charmy!
 Hello, I'm Magical Detective Charmy.
 A terrible crime has been committed.  Someone has eaten my cake.
 To uphold my honor, I will  capture this vile criminal!
 You're the culprit.
 The criminal was bold  enough to go into my room!
 My bedroom!
 You're the damn culprit.
 But the criminal made a grave mistake.
 Look at this handprint!
 That's your handprint, isn't it?
 The culprit is...
 You, right?
 It's me!
 Duh.
 Palace Three-Second Cooking
 Palace Three-Second Cooking.
 The time where I, the royal  head chef of Clover Kingdom,
 introduce a three-second dish  that anyone can make.
 Today, I'd like to make some  curry in three seconds.
 I'm going to be using simple curry  roux procured at the market.
 Next, you'll need carrots, onions, potatoes,
 some mushrooms, and maybe some tomatoes.
 If you try adding secret ingredients  like chocolate or coffee,
 you can make an even more fragrant curry.
 Now, then... You take  those ingredients, and...
 Immediately chop them up using  your magic, and simmer them!
 Make sure you use plenty of love and passion!
 And it's finished. Wasn't that easy?
 Time to eat!
 So good!
 And that concludes this episode of Palace Three-Second Cooking, dishes anyone can make!
 See you next time!
 But that's impossible!
 Birthday
 Birthday.
 I was able to get the wind  spirit to listen to me.
 I shall name her Bell, and today is Bell's birthday.
 This cake is for you, Bell.
 Yay!
 Should we say you're one year old?
 Happy birthday, Bell.
 So pretty!
 Make a wish and blow out the candles.
 Um...
 Huh? Where's the cake?
 Not a chance...
 It's Not as Though I'm Actually Worried
 It's Not as Though I'm Actually Worried.
 Yes, he's brushing each tooth carefully,  with short strokes, ten to twenty times.
 You mustn't scrub so roughly!
 The bubbles are heading toward his eye!
 Safe!
 He's not kicking off his blanket and getting too cold, is he?
 You're so kind, it's almost creepy, Klaus.
 Not happening...
 Family
 Family.
 Oh, my...
 So you decided that you would treat all of  the friends you encountered like family.
 That's so wonderful.
 Yeah.
 Family... So basically, it's like this...
 Big Brother Klaus!
 That tickles!
 Little Brother, allow me  to bestow these upon you.
 Yay, glasses!
 Thanks, Big Brother!
 Not a chance...
 Resilient
 Resilient.
 Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.
 Isn't it hot in there?
 It is.
 Isn't it heavy?
 It is.
 And...
 My face itches, but I can't scratch it!
 I Wonder Why
 I Wonder Why.
 What's the matter, Asta?
 I wonder why Fana doesn't get burned  when Salamander is covered in flames.
 Probably because it's magic?
 I wonder why your clothes don't get  wet inside the Sea Dragon's Lair.
 Because it's magic.
 Why doesn't konbu seaweed  flavor the ocean like dashi?
 Leave any food questions  to me, Professor Charmy!
 The component that gives konbu dashi its  flavor, glutamic acid, lies within its cells.
 Those cells have what's called  ""selective permeability,""
 which gives it the ability  to take in what's necessary
 and get rid of everything it doesn't need.
 The glutamic acid that creates the dashi  in konbu is necessary for its survival,
 so it doesn't leave its cells while  it's still alive within the ocean!
 But once it dies and is dried,  the cells break apart,
 causing the glutamic acid to come out,  which turns into dashi.
 There's no way Stupidsta's  going to understand any of that.
 Captain Yami's Lecture on Magic Knight Rankings
 ""Captain Yami's""... Wait, what is this?
 ""Magic Knight""... Ugh, I can't be bothered.
 Wizard King Grand Magic Knight 1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight 1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight 1st Class Junior Magic Knight 2nd Class Junior Magic Knight
 Wizard King Grand Magic Knight 1st-5th Class Senior Magic Knight 1st-5th Class Intermediate Magic Knight 1st Class Junior Magic Knight 2nd Class Junior Magic Knight  3rd Class Junior Magic Knight 4th Class Junior Magic Knight 5th Class Junior Magic Knight
 So the most important is the Wizard King,  and then there's Grand Magic Knight...
 This is too much work.
 Why are you making a Grand Magic Knight read this?
 I'll kill you!
 What?!
 Grilled Squid
 Grilled Squid.
 Today, I'll show you how to make  some delicious grilled squid.
 Yeah!
 It's super simple. Anyone can do it.
 You say that,
 but you're not going to cheat and use  magic like that one chef did, are you?
 Just watch.
 First, you pull out its insides and cut slits into it.
 Those are actually real instructions!
 Then you season it with sugar,  salt, mirin, and ginger.
 Still real instructions!
 Then, you grill it.
 This is normal cooking!
 All done.
 Yummy!
 There you go. Simple grilled squid  that anyone can make.
 There's no punchline this time.
 Charmy's Seven Transformations, Part II
 Charmy's Seven Transformations, Part II!
 In response to the incredible  number of requests we got from
 Charmy fans across the universe  saying the seven transformations
 from last time just weren't enough,
 we bring you its sequel!
 Transformation one...
 Christmas Tree Charmy.
 La la la, la la la, la la la la laa...

 Santa Charmy!
 Yup. I see we went with six  transformations yet again.
 La?
 La?
 La!
 My meal-saving prince...
 Oh, it was just a dream.
 I need to find more ingredients  and return to the venue.
 Thus ended Charmy's nightmare.
 I'm not exactly sure if it was  a nightmare, but it's over.
 But Asta and the others  haven't finished fighting!
 Their battle is becoming  more fierce and intense!
 This dumbass is actually  putting all his trust in me.
 Damn it.
 You people...
 are not the Magic Knights  that my father dreamed of!
 The battle between Asta, Mimosa,  and the mage who calls himself Xerx
 and Langris, Fragil, and  Sekke reaches its climax.
 What will they see beyond  this battle to the death?
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 83:  ""Burn It Into You.""

 Look forward to our show again next week!

83,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 In the second stage of the  Royal Knights Selection Exam,
 Langris's G Team won by a hair.
 Finral!
 Overcome with madness,
 Langris tried to attack his older brother  Finral, despite the match being over.
 Disappear.
 But the members of the Black  Bulls came to his rescue.
 Hey!
 Just try and do something else.
 Forget the match. We'll kill you.
 Maybe you've been on a roll lately,  but you're still Black Bulls flunkies.
 What do you think you'll do against  the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn?
 Who the hell cares about status when we're  trying to protect our precious friend?!
 I guess making it this far  has gone to your head.
 You sure talk big for a Black Bulls newbie.
 Wizard King, before the next  teams conduct their match,
 would you let me battle them?
 Actually... Let's just start.
 Let the semi-finals begin!
 Sir, aren't you going to stop them?
 In actual combat,  no one says ""stop"" or ""start.""
 At Langris's forceful request,
 the semi-final match between  B Team and G Team began immediately.
 But Julius had another goal:
 to bring the unconscious traitor working  with the Eye of the Midnight Sun to light.
 Asta!
 In order to defeat Langris,  Asta decided to take on his black form.
 It's all you, Xerx!
 He put his faith in a mage who called  himself Xerx and concentrated.
 Yet this dumbass is actually  putting all his trust in me.
 That man's true name was Zora.
 Damn it.
 I'm going to continue protecting everything  I can with all the power that I have.
 That's what makes a Magic Knight!
 Zora's father, Zara, was the first  peasant to become a Magic Knight,
 but he was betrayed by his  own comrades and killed.
 You people...
 are not the Magic Knights  that my father dreamed of!
 Burn It Into You
 Begone! I am a true Magic Knight!
 They got past the magic circle...
 Xerx!
 Congrats on landing the first  attack on me today, Lord Noble.
 What?!
 There's a magic circle on his body?!
 What in the world is that?
 He drew a magic circle on himself?
 That would drain his magic power constantly.
 That's extremely risky.
 Exactly.
 But that's apparently how he does things.
 What...
 ...is he?
 Who...
 Who are you?!
 I'm no one of any importance.
 I was just...
 born a filthy little brat in a peasant town.
 And I am hopeless rage incarnate!
 Take this, you Magic Knight frauds!
 He deflected that spatial magic?!
 And it's twice as powerful now!
 You're no one of any importance...  Don't mess with me!
 That spell was returned to  him twice as powerful...
 And he managed to erase all of it!
 Vice Captain Langris's magical  powers have grown even more!
 But this power...
 Sir...
 Your ultimate move couldn't even scratch me!
 Yet I can become even stronger!
 See? I am special!
 You lot and my useless brother...
 I'm nothing like you!
 Everything you do is useless!
 It's not useless!
 How dare you?!
 Stop that.
 Don't heal me, you royal.
 I humbly decline your request.
 We are on the same team.  We are both Magic Knights!
 What is that form supposed to be?!
 It's nothing special.
 It's just what happens when
 one of those peasants you make  fun of struggles for a long time!
 All of you are eyesores!
 Be careful not to get in the  way of my spatial magic, okay?
 I can't guarantee that you  won't lose something.
 If that were to happen,  Mother and Father aside,
 I'm sure she'd be sad.
 You're right.
 So to ensure that doesn't happen,  I'm going to win!
 How dare you try to stand on the  same stage as me?! I've been chosen!
 I'm special!
 You don't stand a chance against me!
 You're right. You're amazing.
 Your magic stands out even among nobles,  who all have a tremendous amount of magic.
 On top of that, your spatial magic is nuts!
 You were born special.
 I always admired people like you!
 I get to protect the country with a  bunch of amazing people like that.
 Man, being a Magic Knight is awesome!
 But you're different.
 You're amazing, but you're different!
 I'm not asking someone like you to like me.
 I hate you, too!
 But... don't just unfairly take things away!
 You people are special, and we competed with each other
 and helped each other improve
 so that we could protect everyone!
 We became stronger and came this far  so that we could fight together!
 Shut up!
 If you didn't want to die,
 you should've just kept your mouth  shut in your little hole, you failure!
 Is that right? In that case,  I'll take this failed power
 and burn it into you!
 My magic... won't come out!
 Asta...
 Black Meteorite!
 Shut up!
 If you didn't want to die,
 you should've just kept your mouth  shut in your little hole, you failure!
 Is that right? In that case,  I'll take this failed power
 and burn it into you!
 My magic... won't come out!
 Black Meteorite!
 Both teams' crystals were  destroyed at the same time.
 This match is a draw!
 No way!
 He's passed out.
 He got him bah-had.
 You said that the one who keeps winning  will always be right, didn't you?
 You egocentric spatial magic noble.
 And since you lost against a peasant,
 that means you weren't  right about anything.
 No one's going to acknowledge a piece of  shit like you as vice captain anymore.
 You. Fluffy-hatted snow woman.
 What did you do during the last match?
 Did you get freaked out by the spatial magic  noble and just stand there sucking your thumb?
 Must be nice!
 Hey, who do you think you are?
 Shut up.
 Like you have any skills  to begin with, you fake.
 Bah—
 People like you are more  worthless than anyone else.
 Just quit being a Magic Knight  already, you trash.
 Hey, you little shit!
 You trust people way too easily!
 Not everyone is nice or amazing.
 You're gonna regret it someday!
 You don't have to say it like—
 It looks like you try to make  the best move in every situation,
 but make sure you don't stop  thinking when you hit circumstances
 that go beyond what you imagined, you royal.
 And...
 Cool-masked jerk, you should have  had more faith in your companions.
 A draw...
 We didn't win.
 Damn it... Damn it!
 Let's fight with all we've got, together!
 We're all Magic Knights  of the Clover Kingdom.
 I heard it ended in a draw between Asta and your little brother.
 I'd say the Black Bulls' little star  of hope did pretty well.
 He fought head-to-head with the  Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn.
 And that's exactly why
 you need to wake up already.
 Everyone under you is taking all  the glory while you're asleep.
 I did what I could for now,  but his wounds are too deep.
 I need to take him to the  castle's medical tower.
 Cob, if you would.
 Roger-dodger-roger!
 I'll go with you, too.
 You're up next, you jerk.
 You better win!
 Of course!
 Rill   Ruben   Nils
 I Team
 Klaus   Luck   Puli
 K Team
 And now, I Team: Rill, Nils, and Ruben versus  K Team: Puli, Klaus, and Luck.
 We will now begin round three of stage two.
 Yay! Let's give it all we've got!
 But we're up against the  Captain of the Aqua Deer,
 who'll wait until we've made a move,  then strike at our magic's weak points.
 What should we do?
 I have an idea. Wanna hear?
 I can't wait to see what kind  of painting I get to make next!
 If we can manage to support him, we can win.
 Their magic power is being  concentrated and sharpened.
 We'll use a super-fast attack  spell and nail him first
 so he won't have a chance to follow up!
 I'm borrowing the idea from the combo spell
 the people in the first match used.
 Although I think the power behind  this one is even crazier.
 This isn't good!
 We have to hide the crystal!
 There's no point in trying to move it now.
 On a field this size, we'll know  where it is, no matter where it goes.
 This spell is probably  going to be insanely fast!
 I'll have to paint mine first!
 No matter what you try to do, it'll be useless!
 This spell pierces through everything!
 Compound Magic: Lightning Arrow!
 No one can stop it!
 I won't stop it!
 Picture Magic: Game of the Gods!
 I was inspired by the last match, too!
 My methods are different, but I'm  going to enhance the enemy's spell...
 and send it back!
 Whoopsie.
 The crystal has been destroyed!
 I Team wins!
 What the heck was that?
 Th-That was insane!
 The Captain of the Aqua Deer...
 That was amazing! Amazing!
 Rill Boismortier cannot be stopped!
 I'm seeing the masterpiece in my head!
 Yay!
 Well, damn. That was over in a second.
 No worries, la.
 Luck has grown so much  during this competition.
 I made sure to record all of  your progress in my diary.
 Good work.
 Black Bulls...
 Asta is physically exhausted, so he's  resting in the infirmary down below.
 I'll stay by his side,  so please, cheer on Noelle.
 Ben   Brad   Eric
 M Team
 En   Noelle   Yuno
 P Team
 Next up, we have M Team: Ben, Brad, and Eric  versus P Team: En, Yuno, and Noelle.
 We will now begin round four of stage two.
 I have to do this for Asta, too.
 I mean, we have to fight  for everyone who's lost!
 That's right.
 And we'll win.
 Round four of stage two... begin!
 Huh?
 Hey, wait a second!
 I don't have time to waste here.
 Here he comes!
 He's by himself?
 He's mocking us!
 Take this!
 Wind Magic: Towering Tornado!
 What?!
 How dare you, you peasant?!
 Asta, even though you lost,  you're getting right back up, aren't you?
 I know how fast you've been growing.
 The more frustrated you become,  the more you grow.
 Th-The crystal has been destroyed.
 P Team wins!
 That power... What was that?
 That jerk... What the hell did he do?
 I wish I could've fought him, too.
 La!
 Yuno...
 You're going to grow even more, aren't you?
 Hey! Why did you take care  of this all by yourself?
 Use some of my powers, too!
 You're wasting my talent!
 Be quiet.
 Jeez! You're such a tease!
 I guess I don't hate that side of you!
 Next is the second round of the semi-finals.
 We've finally reached the last match.
 The first match of the semi-finals ended  in a draw, so I Team versus P Team,
 for all practical purposes,  is the final match!
 Asta...
 I'm going on ahead.

 None of us have any magic,  but we'll never, ever give up!
 I'm the one who's going to marry Sister Lily!
 No, I am.
 No, I am.
 No, I am.
 No, I am!
 Let's fight!
 We may fight sometimes, but we  quintuplets get along great!
 One of you is loud enough. Who could  stand listening to five of you yapping?
 You can't be serious.
 The final match is finally here.
 I had so much fun seeing all kinds of magic.
 I wish we could keep going.
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 84: "" The Victors.""

 Now, I wonder which team is going to win.

84,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 We will now begin the finals  for the Selection Exam.
 I Team: Rill, Nils, and Ruben, come forward!
 Young Master Rill,
 here's some herbal tea that will clear  your mind and help you concentrate.
 Yay, thank you!
 I'm sure the mistress will be pleased
 when she hears about all of  your ventures this time around.
 What? Mother will?
 You think so?
 But of course.
 Then I definitely need to win.
 Please show the world why  you were able to become
 the youngest Magic Knights Squad  captain in history.
 That's the Captain of the Aqua Deer for you.
 He seems so relaxed despite  the big battle coming up.
 Well, he crushed the other  teams in his last two rounds.
 We made it this far without doing  much at all because of him.
 At this rate, even if our team wins,
 there's no guarantee that we'll  be selected as Royal Knights.
 Who were those two again?
 We have to stand out more!
 Next, P Team: En, Yuno,  and Noelle, come forward.
 Dear members of I Team, please go easy on us.
 I'm gonna crush all of you!
 I'm gonna crush you all into sawdust!
 Uh, your inner voice is spilling out.
 I'm just so excited, I can't contain myself.
 Let's do this, Noelle!
 My expression is as hard as rock truffles!
 Let's fire things up!
 Mushrooms double in flavor  when you cook them!
 You can even dry them or freeze them!
 Let's mushle, mushle to victory!  All together now!
 Mushle—
 Shut up.
 Huh?
 Honestly... I'm already distracted  enough because of Asta.
 I mean, I'm only worried  because he's part of my squad.
 It's not like it bothers me that  Mimosa gets to be by his side!
 Your face is red! Are you  finally getting fired up?!
 Shut your mouth.
 Ugh, you're both so noisy.  You'd better not hold Yuno back!
 Bell...
 We're going full force in the next round.
 Yes! It's finally my turn to shine!
 What?
 You mean he wasn't at full strength yet?
 He's so cool.
 That's what draws people to him,  and makes them admire him...
 I can't wait!
 With you as my next opponent,
 I might finally be able to paint  my ultimate masterpiece!
 I'll also be able to see  just how much I've grown.
 Young Master Rill will be the victor.
 It'll be Yuno!
 It'll be Master Rill.
 Yuno!
 The young master.
 Yu—
 The—
 Ruben  Nils  Rill
 I Team
 Yuno  En  Noelle
 P Team
 So it finally begins.
 This will determine the winning team.
 Though I, the protagonist, am absent,  I hope to see a beautiful match.
 I'm going to watch every second of this  match so I can further my horizons!
 The Victors
 Asta!
 So you finally woke up.
 Where am I?
 Langris!
 You need to lie down.
 Yeah, but—
 It's over.
 That's right. Our team...
 How's Finral?
 His wounds are quite deep... He's been  taken to the castle's medical tower.
 What about Yuno and his team?
 They had a quick victory  again in stage two, la.
 They're about to start the match  to decide the winning team.
 Yuno...
 And now, the final match with I Team...
 I can't wait!
 We'll stand out this time!
 ...and P Team!
 I'll take care of the  Captain of the Aqua Deer.
 He's all yours.
 Begin!
 Whoa! Here he comes!
 I'm right here!
 He doesn't have to call him over!
 Hey! Right over here!
 As we suspected, that newcomer  is heading for Captain Rill.
 I said, I'm right over here!
 Now's our chance.
 Hey!
 Wind Magic: Wind Blade Shower!
 Picture Magic: Game of the Gods!
 What?!
 He's definitely not like  anyone I've faced before.
 That's our number one newbie!  I expect nothing less!
 Ah, so they just greeted  each other with their magic.
 By the looks of it,  neither of them is even trying yet.
 That's what you call a greeting?!  Th-They're on a whole different level!
 Look!
 Bah-ha?!
 There's a battle beginning over there, too.
 The enemy team's crystal  is right in front of us!
 Let's do this!
 Ice Magic: Ice Needle!
 Sandstone Magic: Rock Fall!
 They're both attacking at once?!
 Leave the ice magic to me!
 Noelle, if you'd take care of the  fellow with the sandstone magic.
 Fungus Magic: Towering Mister Mushroom.
 Heyo.
 Bring it!
 Ha-ni-wat?!
 What?!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
 Their defense is strong!
 Then we'll just have to strengthen  our defense as well, and take them on!
 No matter what it takes...
 We're going to destroy their crystal...
 ...and stand out!
 They split up, just like we planned.
 We're going to protect our crystal,  no matter what.
 So...
 We're counting on you over there!
 Wind Magic: Tornado Fang...
 Plus Crescent Moon Sickle!
 Hup!
 Here we go!
 Bell!
 You got it!
 Wind Magic: Swift White Bow!
 Nice, nice!
 Whoa, there!
 Oopsie-daisy...
 Here we go!
 Hup!
 One more time!
 Maybe I was wrong about you.
 I seem to be missing a little something.
 Such versatile and powerful wind magic!
 I guess we should expect that from the  newbie who has the four-leaf grimoire.
 He's powerful!
 But he's up against the  Captain of the Aqua Deer.
 He's blocking everything beautifully.
 Your little spirit friend is a cutie.  This is starting to get really fun!
 But this still isn't enough for me to get the  inspiration for my ultimate masterpiece!
 What's his problem?
 He keeps blocking everything  with his weird paintings! Ugh!
 Bell, we're going to do the thing.
 I planned to use it against  Asta in the finals,
 but I'm up against a Magic  Knights Squad captain.
 You're a worthy opponent.
 In the battle where he lost his five senses,
 his concentration was  heightened to its peak.
 That along with his experience  in controlling mana
 and the training he underwent to use  Mana Skin to protect himself at all times...
 Yuno learned to control the excessive  amount of mana within his body.
 He then refined that technique
 so that he could hold the  spirit's power within him, too.
 This feeling of becoming one with Yuno...
 I just can't get enough of it!
 Asta...
 I'm about to pull far ahead  of you with this one move.
 I am always the one who will win against you!
 Spirit Assimilation: Spirit Dive.
 Wh-What is that overwhelming  amount of magic?
 So beautiful...
 This power was born from your overwhelming  instinct and astounding efforts.
 Yuno, you're...
 Wow...
 Young Master...
 That's amazing, Yuno!
 I feel like I can draw anything right now!
 Wind Spirit Magic...
 Picture Magic...
 Spirit Storm!
 Scream of the Mystical Dragon Vouivre!
 It's amazing... So amazing!
 Please don't draw anymore, Rill!
 No one will be able to accept you!
 Someday, your mother will  understand your talents, too.
 This is the best!
 I never knew that going  all-out against someone...
 ...could make me so happy!
 La...
 Y-Yuno is amazing.
 Damn it... Damn it...
 Why... am I not the one facing Yuno?
 I'm going to win
 against a Magic Knights Squad captain!
 I'm going to win!
 Good...
 Good, good!
 More! More, more!
 Let's draw the ultimate masterpiece
 together!
 Huh?
 Huh?! Wait, why?!
 Things were just about to  get even more interesting!
 His attack didn't hit the crystal, though!
 What in the world?! Why did it break?!
 I'm guessing that with the intense amount  of magical power Rill was emitting,
 the crystal just couldn't take it anymore.
 His own magical powers...
 ...made him self-destruct?
 We couldn't...
 Captain Rill has destroyed  his own team's crystal.
 ...stand out...
 Therefore, P Team—Yuno,  Noelle, and En—wins!
 Th-That battle was unbelievable.
 That final push of their magical  powers gave me goosebumps.
 That newbie is on the same  level as Captain Rill... no.
 He might have even more magic!
 Yes!
 Ahem... Well, he won, but only because  his opponent self-destructed.
 We can't have him getting  a big head because of that.
 I'm not about to lose! I'm going  back and training even harder!
 This isn't fair!
 Young Master.
 Please, wipe away those tears.
 If I were the judge, I would've proclaimed  you the victor, Master Rill.
 Huh? Really?
 I win?!
 By a landslide.
 Oh, come on! There's no way!
 You can't be serious.
 Well, to others, you probably didn't win.
 But you should use this  frustration as motivation
 to draw your next ultimate masterpiece.
 I'm sure that's just what  your mother would want.
 You're right... Thank you, Walter.
 And...
 Yuno.
 We won!
 We did it, Noelle.
 Mushle, mushle! Mushle, mush—
 What did you expect?
 Oh, my gosh! I can't believe we actually won!
 This concludes the Selection Exam.
 First of all, let me congratulate  you on your victory.
 You may have lost by a hair,  but you also did amazingly well.
 Also, the other teams may have been defeated,
 but it doesn't mean you're out of the race.
 I'm going to go over all  of your battles from today,
 and will probably select and announce about  10 to 20 Royal Knights at a later date.
 That means we still have a chance!
 They're all extremely gifted Magic Knights.
 I'm going to have a hard time choosing.
 Finally, His Majesty has something to say.
 Ahem.
 Excellent work today.
 You displayed high levels of magical power
 and versatility in dealing  with various obstacles,
 not to mention the use of careful  planning and combination attacks.
 Any one of your teams could  have easily been the winner.
 He actually said something decent.
 That was decent.
 Way too decent.
 He almost sounds like a real king.
 However! I worked harder than anyone else!
 Without me, this day would've never come!
 I am the one who decided  and announced the formation
 of the ultimate squad of Magic Knights,  the Royal Knights!
 I am the great one who made  this exam happen, so praise me!
 What are you doing?! Hurry up and praise me!
 Your Majesty, please calm yourself.
 They all gathered here because they all  supported the idea of the Royal Knights
 from the bottom of their hearts.
 They gathered here
 determined to protect this kingdom  from the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Don't you think their thoughts and actions  show that they are ready for anything?
 If only the Wizard King  was actually the king.
 If only the Wizard King  was actually the king.
 Shouldn't we just make the  Wizard King the actual king?
 Now, then... I'll be counting on you  if you're chosen to be a Royal Knight.
 Yes, sir.
 Curse you! You're always  standing out more than me!
 We will now bring the Royal Knights  Selection Exam to a close.
 I would say that today's  exam was a huge success.
 Yes. Your other objective,
 to find out which Magic  Knight was being manipulated
 by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,  was also a success.
 We can begin questioning once  Langris recovers from his wounds.
 I'd rather not suspect everyone, but there  might be something more going on.
 We can't let our guard down.
 Thanks for staying by my side, Mimosa.
 Asta...
 My magic can heal physical wounds,  but not his heart.
 We're going back, Mimosa.
 Yuno!
 B-But...
 I see... Asta's...
 Mimosa, it'll be okay. I'll take over.
 D-Don't get the wrong idea!
 It's only natural for me to look  after another member of my squad!
 Yuno...
 Are you sure, Yuno?
 Yuno!
 I'm going to catch up to you!
 I'm the one who's going  to become the Wizard King!
 Like I'd let you catch up to me.
 Hey, Yuno!
 Yuno!
 Yuno...
 You made this?
 Super Magic Knight Zora has a mouth  on him, but he's as good as his word.
 He's a warrior who protects  the country behind the scenes!
 We all believe in each other and get  through life-or-death situations!
 Companions who believe in each other, huh?
 What the hell am I thinking?
 Leaving already?
 Thank you for pointing out the  faults of everyone who lost.
 Though you could've said  things a little more nicely,
 those who want to improve can  actually take those words
 to heart and become stronger.
 Your trap magic and knowledge are vital.
 You will probably pass the  Royal Knights Selection Exam,
 so I'll be counting on you.
 What the hell are you talking about?
 I'm sure you already knew this, but I'm  not the Vice Captain of the Purple Orcas
 or Xerx Lügner. See ya.
 True. I can't commend you for  pretending to be someone else.
 But I wouldn't say it's that big an issue,  given that you're a Magic Knight yourself,
 Zora.
 A long time ago, I met a certain  Magic Knight on the battlefield.
 His name was Zara Ideale.
 He gave his all to protect this country and was a model Magic Knight.
 I ended up alongside this amazing  guy on the battlefield today.
 He could use time magic.
 He's the kind of guy who's gonna succeed.
 His name was cool, too! Novachrono!
 We thought up the star system  so that people like him
 would be acknowledged for their efforts,  rather than their upbringing.
 Despite that, we sadly still have some  misguided Magic Knights among us.
 I think it's about time you put on the  robe from your own squad, don't you,
 Zora Ideale?
 Zora Ideale?
 Who the hell is that jerk?
 I'm just a guy passing through  who couldn't become a super mage.

 Asta hasn't moved at all, huh?
 He's like a doll.
 I-Is he breathing?
 He's breathing, but his  soul's definitely gone.
 It must've been a real  shock that he couldn't win.
 After the battle was over...
 I'm going to catch up to you!
 I'm the one who's going  to become the Wizard King!
 Or so he said. I can't  really blame him, though.
 That pretty boy gave him a clear show of  just how different their ability levels are.
 The shock of realizing his rival had surpassed him over time must've been huge.
 I know exactly how he feels.
 Ah, my little sister... The goddess Marie...
 The longer I go without seeing you,
 the more damaged my soul becomes.
 I-I'm pretty sure that's  not the same thing.
 Yeah...
 I know! I'm gonna ambush him!
 I'm sure he'll feel better after  risking his life in battle.
 Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruc—
 Hold on a second! Fighting's not going  to make him feel better right now!
 We'll never know unless we try!
 We most certainly do know!
 He'll die!
 Well, if I can't use magic,  can I hit him with some bricks?
 No!
 My bestest friend in the whole world,  I know exactly how you feel.
 It's time that I, Gordon Agrippa,
 go over there and gently pat you  on the head to cheer you up.
 Why do you look so out of it?
 Who cares if you couldn't fight your  rival in the finals? Right, Rouge?
 You kicked plenty of butt!
 You passed! You definitely passed!
 Come on, smile. Smile for me.
 I'm telling you to smile. Come on!
 What the hell, Vanessa?
 Vanessa... She's pushing herself so hard  to be cheerful just to cheer Asta up.
 Huh?
 Yeah, she's just putting on a brave face.
 I also put on a brave face when  I can't see my precious Marie.
 W-We should also put on our  brave faces and act chipper!
 You're right. Let's cheer Stupidsta up.
 Yay! That means I can attack him, right?
 No!
 Hi-yah!
 Oh, dear...
 I just told you not to do that!
 A-Are you alive, Stupidsta?
 Hey, I think it's about time.
 Huh?
 For the results of the  Royal Knights Selection Exam!
 I'm sure the messenger owl  will be by any minute.
 Oh... Right.
 Yeah! It should be any time now.
 Asta! If you pass, you'll catch up  to that cool pretty boy in no time!
 Catch up to him and surpass him!
 Do you really think I passed, though?
 I mean, I ended up withdrawing.
 I'm sure you'll be fine.
 Yeah, Stupidsta.  Believe in yourself a little more.
 Noelle...
 I mean, my team won, so I definitely passed.
 You saw how talented I am.
 Wha? The only reason you guys won  is because of that cool pretty boy.
 What did you say, you stupid delinquent  who lost because of your own magic?!
 The hell did you say?!
 You've got some nerve,  talking like that to your senior!
 And who're you calling a delinquent?!
 I'm royalty!
 That doesn't matter!
 It most certainly does!
 Please don't fight...
 No, it doesn't!
 You're the one who should be worried  about whether you passed, not Asta.
 I'm not worried at all!
 I'm sure I passed! No doubt about it!
 Magna, you're super nervous, huh?
 I-I am not, gosh darn it! How rude!
 I can tell.
 Your heart rate and body temperature  have gone up, and you're sweating.
 You're definitely nervous right now.
 Oh, fine. I feel like being nice.
 I'll show you Marie's picture for  3.5 seconds to cheer you up.
 I have a better idea, Asta! Let's fight!
 Huh?
 You're feeling better now, aren't you?
 Of course he isn't!
 Can I attack you with  everything I've got? Can I?!
 No, you can't!
 Huh? Charmy?
 What's the matter, Charmy?
 Just thinking about how cool Yuno was
 makes my heart feel so full  that I can't even eat...
 I only ate a fifth of my usual.
 That's still plenty.
 Asta's not calling her out.
 Guess he's still out of it.
 My meal-saving prince...
 My chest hurts, la...
 You probably just ate too much.
 She's also a goner.
 Yeah... What should we do?
 All right, bath time!
 Mister Yami?
 Bath time?
 Sweating off your stress in the  bath will perk you right up.
 Come on, let's go!
 Nah, I'm gonna pass.
 Captain's orders, brat.  Shut your trap and go!
 Man... The water feels great, doesn't it?
 Y-Yeah...
 Stop that, you little shit!
 Don't make me boil you!
 We're all in the bath.
 We're undoubtedly connected right now.
 Ah, I'm so happy.
 How's everything over there?  Is the water too cold?
 Nope, it's just fine!
 Being in the bath with  everyone... With everyone...
 It's so embar...
 Gondola...
 Hey!
 Why, though?!
 Sure is noisy over there.
 This makes me think about the past.
 Mister Yami?
 Just shut up and listen.
 This was when I first joined the Gray Deer.
 It's the Aqua Deer now, though.
 When Julius was the captain,  it was known as the Gray Deer.
 Right...
 So back when I joined them,
 I went out on a journey to train myself.
 He just launched into story time.
 One day, I got pretty hungry,  so I was fishing.
 And then...
 Man, I'm hungry.
 Hurry up and give me a bite. One bite...
 Take the bait, damn it.
 Looks like a dine and dash.
 I can catch the real deal out on the shore,
 but I'm just not cut out for  a small-time place like this.
 My gut's gonna touch my back soon.
 You guys thieves?
 If you want a fight,  I don't mind giving you one.
 But I'm kinda pissy right now  because I'm starving,
 so I might not be able to hold back.
 P-Please, have these.
 S-Sir Magic Knight, you seemed rather hungry.
 These things had better not be poisoned.
 O-Of course they aren't!  Please, help yourself.
 All right, don't mind if I do.
 Sir Magic Knight, if you would be  willing to listen to our request,
 we could prepare even more for you.
 Request?
 Okay, sure.
 It's almost harvest season.
 Thankfully, we foresee  a good harvest this year.
 Well, that's good.
 But...
 Despite our good harvest,  they're going to come around.
 Who's ""they""?
 Bandits.
 As soon as the harvest's done, they show up
 to steal the precious crops that we spent  so much time nurturing and harvesting.
 We sent a petition to the royal capital,
 but apparently the bandits  are hitting other towns, too,
 so they just can't afford to send  help to our remote little village.
 So you want me to deal with the bandits.
 W-We'll be happy to feed  you while you stay with us.
 Three meals a day!
 To hell with that!
 You want to hire a Magic Knight,  and all you're offering is food?
 W-We don't have any money.
 Our harvest was stolen last year, too,  so we barely made any money.
 The bread I gave you earlier had been  hidden in one of our storerooms.
 Naps!
 I won't work for food alone.
 Add naps to it. That's my final offer.
 Do that, and I wouldn't mind  fighting off these bandits for you.
 Guess that seals the deal.
 And now that I'm full,  I'm going to take a nap.
 S-Sir Magic Knight...
 Could you tell us your name?
 I'm Yami.
 Yami Sukehiro.
 What are we going to do?
 About what, boss?
 Looks like they had a good harvest this year.
 I wonder if we're going to  be able to steal all of it.
 It might be too heavy for us to carry back.
 Not to worry. Some of our  guys can use spatial magic.
 We can just send it all back to the hideout.
 Then I guess we don't have to worry.
 Right. Now, I'm sure the guys  in the village are on their guard.
 Take them down if they get in our way.
 Steal every last crop, boys!
 Yeah!
 Let's see. Where to start...
 Guess I should hit up their  storehouse first. Where is it?
 It's the building to the right there.
 Thank you.
 Huh?
 If I just scare you off,  you'll probably come back again,
 so I need to make extra sure  you don't come back.
 That's one.
 Two.
 Three.
 Nineteen, twenty... Damn,  how many of you are there?
 There's no end to this.
 Good grief.
 To think they had a small fry  Magic Knight protecting them.
 You the boss of these bandits?
 I'm surprised you were able  to find all these losers.
 Get enough losers together and  you can even defeat a whale.
 Even a small leak will sink  a giant ship, as they say.
 Get him, boys!
 The one who takes him out gets a reward!
 Yeah!
 Individually, they're not that strong,  but there are too many of them.
 What am I gonna do?
 Guess all I can do is kick your asses!
 You're mine!
 Shut up.
 Who the hell are you?
 I'm no one suspicious.
 Weird boots.
 Weird pants.
 Weird clothes.
 A weird cape.
 And to top it off...
 A weird mask.
 Everything about you is suspicious!
 Yami, was it?
 I'm counting on you to watch my back.
 Huh? How do you know who I am?
 This guy moves like he can read my mind.
 Our ki goes together.
 Th-That's impossible...
 The two of them defeated all my men?
 The only ones left...
 ...are you bastards!
 Hurry! We're retreating!
 Y-Yes, sir!
 Hey! Who do you think you are,  letting your boss escape like that?!
 Looks like the bandits' boss got away,
 but we managed to round up the rest of them.
 Now this village and the ones nearby  probably won't be attacked for a while.
 Yeah, probably.
 By the way, you still haven't answered me.
 I asked you earlier. How the  hell do you know who I am?
 Oh, that.
 You're quite famous.
 The wild guy from a foreign country  who was chosen to be a Gray Deer.
 Oh?
 And who the hell are you?
 I'm a member of the Gray Deer, too.
 Huh?
 Though most of my missions  are within the royal capital,
 so this is the first time we've met.
 I happened to be nearby  on another mission today.
 Oh, yeah. I guess I did hear about some guy  with a weird mask who joined the squad.
 I guess that's you.
 Calling it weird is quite mean.
 A very special person gave me this mask.
 A special person, eh?
 Special or not, it's definitely weird.
 Who gave you that thing?
 Who, indeed?
 Thank you for everything, Sir Yami.
 Thank you very much.
 Now our village is safe.
 It's no big deal.
 You guys fed me plenty.
 Well, see ya!
 You want one?
 I'll pass. You're the one  that village hired, not me.
 All right, then.
 What are you going to do now?
 Continue my training.
 Wanna tag along?
 I'm sure a lot of interesting things  would happen if I went with you.
 But I'll pass.
 I have my own mission.
 I will follow my own path.
 Farewell.
 Sure.
 You and I...
 Though our paths may differ now,
 I'm sure we'll eventually  end up on the same path.
 The same path?
 In that case...
 I guess that makes you my rival.
 First, I'm going to become a  Magic Knights Squad captain...
 before you do.
 Please. Like I'd lose to you.
 Looks like the challenge is on.  Let's see who can do it first.
 Hey, weird mask guy.
 You never told me your name.
 Vangeance.
 William Vangeance.
 Vangeance?
 Even your name is weird.
 Let's meet again,
 Yami.
 Yeah.
 Well, guess I should get going, too.
 That was the first time that golden weird  mask guy and I fought together.
 And for many years after, the two  would continue their friendly rivalry.
 Petit Clover

 ""Vangeance"" Is Hard to Say
 ""Vangeance"" Is Hard to Say.
 Hey, weird mask guy.
 You never told me your name.
 Vangeance.
 William Vangeance.
 Geangeance?
 Vangeance.
 Vangeance, zansu?
 Just ""Vangeance.""
 Chowchowce?
 That's even farther off.
 Oh, maybe it's this.
 No, not a fan (sensu).
 This is a hand fan (uchiwa).
 Ah, you tricked me.
 I'll say it one last time. It's Vangeance.
 Shampoo and cream rinse?
 Daily treatment for your hair is important.
 And for many years after,  the two would continue their—
 Just stop!
 My apologies.
 Well, that was a bit embarrassing,
 telling my squad about my past like that.
 Man, I was a young'un back then.
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 86: ""Yami and Vangeance.""

 Actually, I'm still young. I'm only 28!

86,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 When he was younger,  Yami was on a journey to train,
 when the head of a little village asked him  to protect it some magical bandits.
 He ended up battling the bandits,
 and during that battle...
 Yami, was it?
 I'm counting on you to watch my back.
 Yami encountered Vangeance, who was nearby on another mission.
 First, I'm going to become a  Magic Knights Squad captain...
 Looks like the challenge is on.  Let's see who can do it first.
 And all kinds of stuff happened after that.
 A few years later,  Julius became the Wizard King,
 and both the golden weird mask guy and I
 The Wizard King's Attendant Marx Francois
 were appointed Vice Captains  of the Gray Deer.
 Vice Captain of the Gray Deer William Vangeance
 Vice Captain of the Gray Deer Yami Sukehiro
 Then, one day...
 28th Wizard King Julius Novachrono
 Hey! Thanks for coming.
 Welcome!
 You don't have to be so formal with us.
 I agree.
 I heard you did amazing work exploring  that dungeon the other day.
 It was nothing.
 I heard you saved all the  knights who were caught
 by the trap spell with your magic.
 I wish I could've seen that magic!
 Oh, I'll give you the stars for  that next time. Don't worry.
 I'm honored. Thank you very much.
 I heard you were absolutely fierce in  the defensive battle at Kuka Village.
 I heard you split the giant soldier that the  enemy created using rock magic in two.
 Yeah, that was nothing...
 Actually, it was everything!  You're going to give me some stars, too, right?
 Of course! I'm sure your  captain is very proud.
 Sir, it's about time.
 Oh, right. Sorry to have you  stop by when you're so busy.
 There's a job that I'd like  you two to take on.
 Bandits?
 Yeah, they're causing trouble all over.
 Would you two catch them for me?
 Of course, sir.
 The Magic Knights live to serve and  protect the people of the Clover Kingdom.
 We will happily accept this mission.
 But...
 Why are you just asking the two of us?
 Well, it's possible that
 someone from the Magic Knights  is aiding the bandits.
 Well, can't say I'm surprised.
 I don't think they're ordinary bandits.
 They're very organized and even  have some ancient magic items.
 Pretty powerful ones, at that.
 It may be that someone is providing them
 with magic items that we found in dungeons.
 I see. So that's why you want us.
 If all the Magic Knights were assigned  to this, evidence may be destroyed,
 and the guilty party may disappear.
 That's why we've been assigned  to this secret mission.
 Exactly.
 Say, Julius. What are you going to  do if one of us is that traitor?
 We might just let the bandits escape.
 Well, that would be a problem.
 But I think I know you  two pretty well by now.
 I've known you both since before  you even joined the Magic Knights.
 That's why I trust you.
 But if you two end up betraying me,  I guess there's not much I can do.
 You always were a cunning old dude.
 Well, I'll be counting on both of you.
 Yes, sir.

 I've marked the towns and villages that  have been attacked by the bandits.
 I see... So they're showing up  in unexpected places.
 Must be so people won't figure  out where they'll show up next.
 Nean Common Realm Kikka
 I've sent messages to the Magic Knights  in these areas to be on their guard,
 but that information  might've also been leaked.
 The bandits keep appearing in places  that aren't heavily guarded.
 Heart Kingdom
 We're gonna have to figure out  where they'll pop up next,
 but that'll be tough to do.
 No, it's actually quite simple.
 Huh?

 First, we can rule out any place  that's already been attacked.
 Spade Kingdom
 Diamond  Kingdom
 The next likely targets will probably be  somewhere a treasure's been found lately,
 or somewhere near a harvest.
 A bountiful one, specifically.
 Even then, that's more than  ten or twenty places.
 We can probably rule out places that  are near the sites of attacks, too.
 They'll probably assume that such places  will be on alert and harder to attack.
 Even then...
 You think the two of us can't  cover so many locations, right?
 I know. That's why...
 Nean
 Common Realm
 Kikka
 Here, and here...
 And this village.  Could you send out Magic Knights
 to these locations to be on  high alert for these bandits?
 Why, though? If someone's leaking,  there'd be no point—
 I see!
 You want to take advantage of the fact  that someone is leaking information.
 Yes. They'll probably avoid places that  are being guarded by the Magic Knights.
 They'll prioritize places that  aren't being guarded by the Knights.
 I-I knew that, duh...
 I was just testing you.
 Which means the places they're  probably going to go after
 will be the town of Aymaia or Zocodany Village.
 Heart Kingdom
 Yami and Vangeance
 How are things looking over there, Yami?
 Nothing suspicious so far.
 Zocodany Village
 It appears that an ancient magic item
 was found in a cave near  Zocodany Village recently.
 That item is being regarded
 as the village's treasure and is on  display at the village elder's home.
 Only a handful of Magic Knights  would know about that at this point.
 It's too early for the bandits  to show up for that treasure.
 So if they show up in  search of that treasure,
 it'll be clear that there's  a traitor within our ranks.
 Yeah. How are thing looking in Aymaia?
 Nothing suspicious here, either.
 They just finished harvesting, and they're  preparing for their harvest festival.
 The Town of Aymaia
 Apparently, their harvest  was very good this year.
 I'm sure the bandits would  love to get their hands on it.
 Just to remind you...
 No matter where the bandits show up,  don't handle them alone.
 We'll wait until we contact the other  and they arrive to fight.
 Got it?
 Yeah, yeah.
 You better not go back on that just so  you can get all the stars for yourself.
 I won't.
 I'll contact you again if I see anything.
 Jeez...
 They actually showed up.
 Hey, they're here, masked weirdo.
 You hear me? Hey!
 What the hell is going on?  This thing was working fine earlier.
 This ki...
 Are they blocking the flow of mana?
 Looks like they're somehow  able to block comms.
 Guess they aren't ordinary bandits after all.
 Must be a traitor from the Magic Knights...  I'm gonna have to hunt them down.
 Looks like there are thirty...  no, more than that.
 There are probably at least fifty.
 No matter where the bandits show up,  don't handle them alone.
 We'll wait until we contact the other...
 Well, I can't get a hold of you,  so what the hell am I supposed to do?
 I'm just gonna have to go on my own!
 I'll cut them down before  they get to the village.
 Dark Cloaked...
 Black Blade!
 An enemy attack! Scatter!
 Who the hell are you?!
 A Magic Knight?
 You've got some nerve, facing us alone!
 You're gonna regret that!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!
 That should take care  of about half of them...
 Are you the boss?
 I think I've seen you before.
 You don't look like a Magic Knight, though.
 You're the guy from that one time.
 What one time?
 A few years ago, you got in the way of  us plundering that crummy little village.
 Guess I get to repay you for  that sooner than I thought.
 A few years ago?
 Hey! You're the dude from that one time!
 I see now...
 Putting the guy's horrible  fashion sense aside,
 his magic powers aren't too impressive,  but that staff is bad news.
 Was that a treasure someone  found in a dungeon?
 Don't think I'm the same as before!
 Hey, who gave you that staff?
 If you want to know,  you'll have to defeat me first!
 Take this!
 Damn you guys for wasting my time.
 Now, then...
 Let's have you spill who  the hell gave you this staff.
 Five... four... three...
 W-Wait! I'll tell you!
 Th-The truth is...
 Stay in your home!
 Not another step, Magic Knight!
 If you move, this old bat is gonna get it!
 I'm gonna pay you back a millionfold!
 How? You think your buddies  stand a chance against me?
 No, they probably don't.
 But...
 Wha—
 This magic—
 It's a type of earth magic spell,  Witch Hunter Claws,
 you see.
 Likewise,
 that's a binding spell  called Sheep Horn Snag.
 I've seen you guys before.
 You're Goht from the Crimson Lion Kings  and Mohl from the Silver Eagles.
 Silver Eagles Squad Member Mohl
 Crimson Lion Kings Squad Member Goht
 Guess we actually had two  traitors instead of one.
 So you were the ones giving these bandits
 magic items and information,  and having them attack the villages.
 There's no use in struggling.  No man can break through that.
 You guys are a disgrace to the Magic Knights!
 You're the foreigner named Yami Sukehiro  that the Wizard King picked up, aren't you?
 I thought the Wizard King was up to  something. So this is what it was.
 Which means that the  Wizard King's order to protect
 the villages in the area was a diversion
 to pinpoint where we'd attack next.
 I guess we completely fell for it.
 Lord Goht and Lord Mohl,  you're amazing for figuring out their plan!
 You go hurry up and find their treasure.
 Y-Y-Yes, sir.
 Uh, it was at the village elder's house,  right? Hey, take me there.
 O-Okay...
 You men, follow me!
 Yes, sir!
 The Magic Knights exist to serve and  protect the people of the Clover Kingdom!
 Yet you bastards...
 We'll tell the Wizard King
 that we found you after you'd  been defeated by the bandits.
 Don't think I'll go down that easily!
 I'll pay you back a millionfold!
 Oh, my. Only a weakling would  say something like that.
 Goodbye now.
 How long do you think he can hold out?
 Just give it up already.
 Like I'd give up that easily!
 Not yet... I'm not done yet!
 I think you're just about at your limit.
 Who the hell cares about limits?
 I'll just surpass them! Right here, right now!
 Dracaena Formation.
 Are you all right?
 Took you long enough!
 I'll have you know that I hurried over.
 When I wasn't able to get a hold of you,
 I figured the bandits had  appeared in Zocodany.
 Looks like I owe you one.
 And I'm gonna pay it back quick, masked weirdo.
 They're the ones behind all this.
 Goht and Mohl... I see.
 William Vangeance...
 I guess you were following the  Wizard King's orders, too.
 We'll just have to defeat you  along with Yami Sukehiro.
 You bastard!
 Attack of the Horn!
 Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!
 I told you I'd pay you back  a billionfold, didn't I?
 Please go easy on me.
 Not bad.
 Let's negotiate. Why not join us?
 Join you?
 Yes, it'll be quite fun.
 That sounds tempting... But I'll pass.
 I swore my loyalty to the  Wizard King, after all.
 I see. That's unfortunate.
 Looks like I already paid you back.
 It truly is unfortunate
 that there were traitors  among the Magic Knights.
 Now, all that's left is...
 Yeah.
 I don't know who the hell  that is, but take him down!
 I wasn't planning on interfering,
 but I think I'm allowed  to have a little fun.
 The hell?
 Well done.
 You were able to capture the traitors  as well as all of the bandits.
 I mean... the bandits' boss was  out cold at the top of the tree.
 I guess weirder things have happened.
 Again, excellent work.
 By the way...
 Yami, Vangeance...
 Considering everything you've done so far,
 I'm appointing both of you  as captains of new squads.
 You're making us...
 ...captains of new squads?
 Will you accept my offer?
 I guess the competition to see who can  become squad captain first ended in a draw.
 Yes, but our true competition  still lies ahead.
 Yeah.
 I won't lose.
 Neither will I.
 I believe in both of you. Yami,  what kind of squad will you create?
 What kind of squad? Let's see...
 A squad where status, bloodlines,  and social standing don't matter.
 I'll round up some outsiders and hooligans,  and create a place where they can belong.
 Just like you did for me.
 Sure. That sounds great!
 I'll call them... Let's see...
 I'll gather up a bunch of guys who all  have their own color, mix them all up,
 and once their colors all mix together...
 Black. The Black Hooligans?
 Nah, let's go with bulls.
 Okay, I'll call them the Black Bulls!
 The Black Bulls...
 That sounds perfect for you.
 And you?
 I will create the Golden Dawn.
 The Golden...?
 Yes. Creating the ultimate squad is  my way of repaying you, Lord Julius.
 As the name suggests,
 I will make a squad that will bring  a golden dawn to this world.
 Even though the night is dark,
 I will prove that the light will always shine,  and a golden dawn will come one day.
 How cheesy can you be?
 That sounds wonderful, too. I look forward to it.
 Starting today, you are the Captain of the  Golden Dawn. Congratulations, William.
 Thank you, sir.
 And starting today, you are the Captain of  the Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls.
 Congratulations, Yami.
 Looking forward to working with you, Goldie.
 So there you have it.
 Right...
 What'd you think?
 Um... I guess you went through a lot.
 So, what were you trying to say?
 Even if you stumble,  even if you think you might lose,
 you'll be fine as long as you don't give up!
 Don't ever give up in any situation!
 Surpass your limits!
 Then a path will always open up for you!
 Quit being so depressed just because  you lost to your rival once!
 Even if you lose 99 times, you just  have to win the next time!
 I-I see... You should've just  said that in the first pla—
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Captain! You're going to crush my skull!
 But Captain Yami's right!
 There's no point in being depressed!
 All right! I'm gonna catch  up to Yuno and surpass him!
 Come to think of it,
 shouldn't we be getting the results from  the Royal Knights Selection Exam soon?
 O-Oh, yeah... I-I can't wait!
 Come on, messenger owls!
 The hell? That's no messenger owl.
 I dunno who the hell you are,  but stop that racket!
 Don't you know that this is the  home of the Black Bulls,
 the Magic Knights Squad that Mister Yami—
 Th-The heck?!
 Y-You're Lady Sisgoleon!

 I'd rather you didn't call me that, either.
 Baldie Long Drawers Mask Guy!
 Please stop.
 Baldie Long Drawers Belly Warmer Mask Guy!
 This doesn't even make sense anymore.
 Baldie Long Drawers Belly Warmer  Tiny Mustache Mask Guy!
 How long is this going to go on?
 Baldie Long Drawers Belly  Warmer Tiny Mustache...
 who wears his shirt and  socks backwards... Mask Guy?
 No, really. How long?

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Yami's tales of his younger years taught Asta
 that you'll always find a path  as long as you don't give up,

 Just shut up and accept this, you fool.
 Um... Is this some hellish drink  that'll set my throat ablaze
 and make me spit fire after a single sip?
 It's to thank you for visiting Fuegoleon. Do you wanna die for real?
 You don't need to thank me.
 At any rate, this drink can't be for humans  if someone as violent as you likes it.
 I don't want it.
 Okay, I'm going to kill you.
 You're not supposed to kill  the person you're thanking.
 I'll kill you with gratitude.
 Your eyes are way too serious...
 I dislike jokes.
 You don't want it, Captain?  Then can I have it?
 Oh, I see. You just came to see Captain Yami.
 I totally thought you were gonna  take me someplace awful aga—
 While I'm at it, I might  as well take you lot, too.
 What do you mean by that?!  Where are you taking us?
 Hell? Is it hell?!
 No! Wh-Why are you taking me, too?!
 Are there strong people where we're going?
 Are you leaving already? But I made tea...
 H-Hey! Your squad members  are being kidnapped!
 Do something!
 Well, if that means you're leaving, have at it.
 What?!
 We're sacrifices! What the heck  did we do to deserve this?!
 Looks like you guys shoulda  been better people!
 Especially you, Luck! Serves you damn right!
 They all passed the  Royal Knights Selection Exam.
 What?!
 W-We passed?!
 We made it into the Royal Knights?!
 I couldn't win the tournament, but Yuno didn't leave me behind, either!
 We can both still strive to become the  Wizard King and fight on the same stage!
 Heck yeah!
 I did it!
 I passed! I passed!
 That means I get to stay with Asta—
 N-Not that I actually care about that!
 I-I mean, I'm happy that Asta passed,
 but that's just because he's in  the same squad as me! Yeah!
 That's all it is!
 Noelle, it'll be great working  together as fellow Royal Knights!
 H-Hmph.
 Don't go barging in on your own again  and cause trouble for everyone else.
 Yeah! I've been training even harder,  so you don't have to worry about that!
 Did you even hear what I said?!  I said don't go barging into places!
 By the way, I believe there's  one other Black Bull who passed.
 Huh? One more?
 R-Really? Maybe I'm the  one you're looking for.
 Hey, right here!
 I don't see him, though.
 Hello?! I'm right here!
 Right here! Magna Swing!
 It's not you.
 It doesn't matter.  A summons has been sent to them.
 Guess I didn't make it after all.
 Magna...
 Too bad for you, Magna.
 I'm gonna become even stronger  in the Royal Knights,
 so I might get too strong for you.
 H-Hey, what are you—
 You've got some nerve, you little shit!
 I'll keep getting back up no  matter how many times I fall!
 You'd better not crap your pants when you  come back and I'm way stronger than you!
 All right, training time!  Vanessa, spar with me!
 What? But I'm about to enjoy this.
 I wanna get stronger! I have to!
 Oh, fine. I guess I'll just have my  fun later, you virgin delinquent.
 Who are you calling a delinquent?!
 You'd better be ready, Luck!  So... come back safely.
 Yeah!
 The same goes for you two.
 Yeah!
 But of course.

 I also won't hold back in crushing you!
 You can't be serious.
 Listen up! You sixteen survived  the brutal Selection Exam
 and were chosen to become Royal Knights.

 So you are disrespecting me.
 I wanted to see how strong you were, since my life's going to be in your hands.
 Pleasure to work with you.
 You're—
 Wait!
 Wh-Why the heck are you wearing that robe?!
 Hey! Why the heck are you  wearing a Black Bulls robe?!
 You dumbass. It's because I'm a member  of the Black Bulls, obviously.
 What?!
 You're one of the Black Bulls?!
 Hey! Explain yourself!
 It's a bittersweet memory from years ago.
 I was kicking the asses of some  Magic Knights due to reasons.
 Magic Knights?! You can't do that!
 Ow!
 Shut up. I said I had reasons, you little shit.
 Anyway, while I was doing that,  I ran into this terrible monster,
 and he ended up kicking my ass instead.
 Y-You bastard...
 This is...
 You're pretty fun, so you can have that.
 You can toss it if you don't want it, though.
 Quit messing with me, you crazy Magic Knight!
 Like I'd ever wear—
 You shouldn't just hand these out like candy!
 See? You do understand.
 Anyway, you can just put it  on whenever you feel like it.
 So, yeah, that's what happened.
 Yami scouted me, and I got into the  Magic Knights through the back door.
 What the heck, Xerx?! That's not fair!
 Also got in through  the back door
 Do you have any idea what  I went through to get in?!
 Also, I'm not Xerx.
 The name's Zora Ideale,  you shitty little junior shrimp.
 What?! What the heck is a Zora?
 Is that your real name?!
 I just told you it was, you stupid shrimp.
 Why the heck did you lie?!
 You know what they say.
 If you want to fool your enemies,  you need to fool your friends first.
 What enemies?! And wait,  are you my senior, then?!
 Damn straight. Show me some respect.
 Heck no! And you need to  apologize for a lot of things!
 What was your name again? Zura?
 It's Zora.
 I don't know what the heck is going on!
 You're so noisy, you shitty little shrimp.
 Ah, what the hell?
 I'll start working toward it now. Not a  super mage, but a true Magic Knight.
 Here you go. Have another rainbow stink bug.
 It's a raging stench!
 Actually, it smells kinda okay  once you get used to it...
 It absolutely does not!
 You're right! It reeks like no other!
 Hey, you should fight me, too!
 How long are you gonna keep yapping,  you impudent little fools?!
 We're sorry!
 Huh? Where'd everyone else go?
 They went to change into their  Royal Knights robes ages ago, you fools!
 R-Royal Knights robes, you say?!
 What in the world is that  super-cool-sounding thing?!
 They were created for our fight against
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun,  with high resistance to magic attacks!
 Hurry up and go change!
 Hey, look!
 Well? Well?
 Isn't he just the handsomest?
 I think I fell in love all over again!
 Who knew a day would come when  we'd be wearing the same robes?
 But we're not on the same level.
 I'm the one who'll become the Wizard King.
 Nope, it's me!
 You can't be serious.
 All right, it looks like  you've all finished changing.
 So beautiful. Why do I look  so good in everything?
 Brother, you're so narcissistic  that it's making me ill.
 This is so exhilarating.
 It fits so nicely, even on us heftier folks.
 Whoo! I'm so pumped!
 I-I guess it's not bad.
 Um...
 Why's mine so short?!
 What's with that robe?!
 Asta, why are you joking around?
 I'm not! This is how it  looked when I put it on!
 Guess the half-baked twit  also gets just half a robe.
 We ran out of fabric because we  got a few additional members.
 Additional members?
 They didn't take the exam, but they  are essential to making this plan work.
 Mage Attendant to the Wizard King Cob Portaport
 1st Class Intermediate Magic Knight Shiren Tium
 Shiren Tium and Cob Portaport.
 Shiren's sandstone creation magic can  create models of the enemy's base
 and measure the magic  levels of the mages there.
 Cob has very convenient spatial magic.
 He has been added because Finral Roulacase  is still recovering from his injuries.
 And one more...
 Captain of the Silver Eagles Nozel Silva
 Nozel Silva! He will be joining us, too.
 Nozel...
 The Captain of the Silver Eagles?
 We couldn't ask for better!
 Unbelievable! I get to  fight alongside my captain!
 I figured you'd decline.  What brought this on?
 I don't want to hear anything from you.  I'm only here because the king ordered it.
 You lot, along with these three,  are the Royal Knights!
 What?! Hey, Nozel!
 Why did you just show up  like it's no big deal?!
 You didn't even take the exam!  That's not fair!
 What I want to know is, why did you bother  taking the exam when you're a captain?
 What?! I could've joined  without even taking the exam?!
 King of the Clover Kingdom Augustus Kira Clover XIII
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun  is a fearsome enemy!
 The aid of a Magic Knights Squad captain, particularly a royal one, will be essential!
 Nothing beats royalty!  It's all about us royals!
 Hey, it's the king.
 Hello, Your Majesty,  King Augustus Kira Clover XIII.
 She's so fierce.
 I can't remember the last time  anyone used my full name.
 Listen well, men! Don't do  anything to bring shame upon—
 I think you all know this, but we have  no use for anything other than victory!
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun is
 a terrorist organization that  threatens the Clover Kingdom!
 If we don't take care of them ourselves,  there will never be peace in our land!
 You all worked together when  they attacked the royal capital
 and were successful in eliminating them,
 but there were still severe consequences.
 My foolish younger brother Fuegoleon  fell at the enemy's hands,
 and he has still not awakened.
 What we learned from the agents  we captured is that their leader
 is a mage with a four leaf  clover grimoire, Licht.
 We learned that they have an upper  echelon called the Third Eye...
 And that, for reasons unknown,
 they are collecting magic  stones in order to be
 reborn in their true forms  and obtain great power.
 There are only three magic stones left.
 We were able to obtain two of  them before they got to them.
 We were also able to defeat Vetto, the Third Eye's user of beast magic,
 as well as Fana, who commanded Salamander.
 The remaining member of the Third Eye  is a user of copy magic, Raia.
 There's no doubt that Raia and Licht will  be our strongest opponents in this battle!
 We are going to be attacking  their stronghold,
 so our enemy will do everything  they can to stop us.
 Some of us may fall,
 but we will be victorious!
 We are going to give our all in this battle!
 Any fools who fail to do so will be
 taken out by me before we even  get to the enemy's stronghold!
 Are you ready?!
 Yes!
 Your Majesty, King Augustus Kira Clover XIII!
 Wh-Why are you yelling at me?!
 Please continue what you were saying earlier.
 You're ordering me to continue the conversation  when you already said everything?!
 There's absolutely nothing else left to say!
 Well, do good work out there. That is all.
 Really?!
 That's it?
 Oh, yeah. Where is the Eye of the  Midnight Sun's hideout, anyway?
 A good question, even though  he's an infuriating little peasant.
 Well—
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout
 is located in...
 Strong Magic Region ""Gravito Stones"" Floating Dungeon
 a floating dungeon within the strong  magic region known as Gravito Stones!
 Guess I'm pretty late.
 Heya.
 I see you look as moronic as ever.
 Don't be like that.  Let's have a drink sometime, Miss.
 I decline.
 He is pretty weak.
 Oh, there they are.
 Hey there, Raia.
 Jeez, you're late!
 Are you too lazy to even wake up nowadays?
 You're the worst.
 Oh, shut up.
 Jeez, Patry. Hogging the  spot next to Licht again?
 After tomorrow's ceremony,  he's going to belong to someone else,
 so you should probably cut the cord soon.
 Shut up. I can do what I want.
 What, you little brat?!
 It's fine. Even if I marry Licht,  he still belongs to everyone.
 The human princess sure is nice.
 That kindness is going to  cause you trouble someday.
 Anyway, that space is gonna  be gone sooner or later.
 Stop picking on him. Patry knows that.
 So, Licht, how does it feel, knowing you're  going to be a father in a few months?
 I can feel the mana blessing us.
 I'm very happy our child will come into  this world welcomed by everyone.
 This child is our future.
 It'll bridge the gap between elves and humans.
 Congratulations, Licht and Tetia!
 Congratulations!
 Talk about a fleeting dream...
 I guess the awakening must be near.

 All Kinds of Robes, Part 1.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The list of Magic Knights who  made it into the Royal Knights
 was announced at last.
 Zora, one of those who passed, arrived late.
 Shiren Tium, Cob Portaport, and the  Captain of the Silver Eagles, Nozel Silva,
 were also added later on as support,
 making for a total of 20 Royal Knights.

 The Crimson Lion Kings' Headquarters
 I thank you for coming, my rival!
 The Crimson Lion Kings' Headquarters Infirmary
 I heard from my sister that you two  passed the Royal Knights Exam.
 Yeah! We're finally gonna take  down the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 We're leaving in three days.
 We're standing by in the royal capital  until then so information won't be leaked.
 I see.
 Um...
 Hm?
 How's Fuegoleon doing?
 He's still asleep.
 We still don't know what happened  to him when he was captured
 by the Eye of the Midnight Sun during  their attack on the royal capital.
 Whatever they did, I'm sure it was underhanded.
 Yet even then, my brother would just say...
 ""The reason I was unable to defeat  them was my own weakness.""
 I will train even harder,  catch up to all of you,
 and surpass you!
 Leopold...
 I will get revenge for Captain Fuegoleon,  no matter what!
 Captain Fuegoleon didn't laugh at  my dream to become the Wizard King.
 He even called me a rival.
 The reason I'm here right now  is because of Captain Fuegoleon.
 Me, too.
 Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of.
 However, staying weak is!
 Those words helped me grow stronger.
 Asta, Noelle, I'm counting on you.
 Yeah! For the sake of returning  peace to this country...
 ...we'll defeat the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 Next time, let's fight together, Leo!
 Of course! Be careful.
 Yeah!
 We'll come by again.
 I hope Captain Fuegoleon  and Finral both wake up soon.
 Not to mention...
 The eerie feeling I got from that mana...
 The Eye of the Midnight  Sun might be behind that.
 We have to defeat them.
 Yeah...
 But something's been bugging me.
 Huh?
 You remember what that hairy gorilla said?
 For some reason, they can't forgive us, either.
 We're fighting each other because  we can't forgive each other.
 And I mean, if we could forgive each  other, we wouldn't have to fight...
 So that means...
 Even I have no idea what I'm trying to say!
 That's what you get for thinking  so hard when you're so stupid.
 Don't call me stupid!
 Then again, Captain Yami  told me the same thing!
 All right! At times like this,  I need to work out!
 First, my abs!
 Next, my back muscles!
 You meathead.
 Everything's cramping at once!
 You can't be serious.
 Yuno! Mimosa and Mr. Glasses, too!
 Did you come to visit Fuegoleon, too?
 No, we're here for another reason.
 The Golden Dawn had the most members pass  the Royal Knights Entrance Exam, after all.
 Asta! Are you all right?!
 No need to worry about me!
 I've trained every single muscle in my body!
 We've been having fiery meetings with  Captain Mereoleona these past few days
 The only thing you haven't  trained is your brain.
 so we don't let anyone down.
 Yup, exactly! It's super weak!
 Hey, don't make fun of me!
 If there's a spell to make someone smarter,  could someone use it on Asta?
 Oh, you're so nice, Yuno!
 Don't make weird requests like that!
 I'm terribly sorry. I can't think of any.
 I'm actually kinda disappointed!
 Honestly...
 We have a big battle ahead of us,  and you show no sense of urgency.
 What if an enemy spy finds out our plan?
 A spy?
 It's entirely plausible.
 They were able to bribe the  Captain of the Purple Orcas
 to help them out with their  attack on the royal capital.
 You can never be too cautious.
 True.
 We've gotta be careful.
 If you two are also heading to the  royal capital, would you like a ride?
 On my vessel.
 Wow, really? Awesome! Thanks!
 Well, if you insist...
 Royal Capital Lodging House
 So good!
 So good! So good!
 The food in the royal capital  is on another level!
 Oh, dear.
 Asta, you have some sauce on your mouth.
 Forgive me! I'm being too forward!
 Thanks, Mimosa!
 You're eating entirely too much.
 I thought you were going to be more cautious.
 Y-Yeah! Look at you,  getting your mouth wiped like a baby.
 N-Not that I care the slightest bit!
 But I am on my guard.
 Normally, I'd eat at least twice this much!
 You can't be serious.
 I'm worried.
 It's not just Asta.
 They may be talented, but there are  a lot of troublemakers among them.
 I can't wait to fight some people!
 I'm gonna beat them to  a pulp and squash them.
 Zora is all by himself!
 He must be too shy to talk to the others.
 I need to be the one to break the ice!
 Take a look at this!
 This is what your face looks like!
 It stinks so bad!
 C-Captain Rill?!
 All of you lack manners.
 Meals are meant to be enjoyed  in a much more elegant,
 beautiful, and distinguished fashion.
 You dare run away from me because  you don't want to be eaten?
 What a repulsive mushroom.
 Hey! Wait!
 You... repulsive... mushroom!
 Don't eat my brethren!
 Everyone, it appears that Miss Puli  wants to give us the gift of song.
 Puli, Puli, Puli, my skin's so pretty!
 I'm a lovely lady who sings so sweetly!
 What the hell is this song?!
 Puli, Puli, Puli, I'm a lovely lady
 How bad a singer can one be?
 As rude as this sounds,  I want to murder someone.
 with supple cheeks!
 Shut up!
 Puli poo pariponpen!
 I can't get any useful information  while I'm sticking to that guy!
 Pushka, pushka...
 What's the matter,  Captain of the Silver Eagles?
 You're taking three days  to start this operation.
 You're being awfully cautious.
 What are you getting at?
 Do you think I'm hesitating?
 No. It appears I needn't worry.
 You always were perceptive.
 I set a trap to find out how much  the enemy knows of our plans.
 Well, let's hear it.
 Did you really think you could  trick me with such a foolish spell?
 Damn it!
 You're not getting away.
 A spy from the Eye of the Midnight Sun?!
 I can't believe there really was one...
 Mushroom is shocked!
 Second-Place Rookie,
 apparently, he was following you.
 To think I hadn't noticed...
 How disgraceful.
 I questioned him without killing him,
 but apparently, our enemy hasn't  noticed any of our movements.
 Therefore, we will be moving up  the operation's start time.
 We strike the Eye of the Midnight  Sun's hideout tomorrow morning.
 T-Tomorrow?
 Not in three days?
 I don't want Yuno to see  me right after I wake up!
 Make sure you all get plenty of rest tonight.
 That is all.
 It appears Lady Mereoleona intended  all along to depart immediately
 as soon as she captured the enemy spy.
 So if you want to fool your enemies,  you must first fool your friends.
 But tomorrow morning?
 What a scary lady.
 What's up, shitty shrimp junior?
 You scared?
 It's the exact opposite.
 The reason I want to become Wizard King
 is so that everyone who lives here
 can have a free country  where they can always smile.
 I'm going to stop their rampage,  no matter what!
 You'd better not go on a  rampage and hold us back.
 I'm never going to lose to you!
 I'm the one who's going to win.
 It's finally time.
 Yes.
 Tomorrow is when we finally settle this.
 We're going to...
 ...defeat the Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 Gravito Stones Floating Dungeon The Eye of the Midnight Sun's Hideout
 Holy crap! There's a castle  floating in the sky!
 That's the Eye of the  Midnight Sun's hideout.
 Well, there aren't many who would  set foot in the strong magic regions.
 And since it's hidden by this  magical fog, it's even harder to spot.
 Anyone would have difficulty finding it.
 You figured all that out, and that's  why you had people search this area.
 You've gotten better,  Captain of the Silver Eagles.
 I just happened to have  people searching dungeons,
 and we coincidentally found  out it was their hideout.
 Oh? So what brought the Captain of  the Silver Eagles himself here, then?
 That's enough idle chatter.
 You can use your spell from  this distance, can't you?
 Indeed.
 Stone Creation Magic:  Stone Model of the World.
 That's so cool!
 I see. It's like an ants' nest that  allows entry from anywhere.
 Seems simple enough to infiltrate.
 I see there are plenty of guys  around Senior Magic Knight level.
 There's someone with very  powerful magic in the middle.
 Must be their boss.
 So that's where Licht is...
 Captain Nozel, what is our plan?
 I am not the Captain of the Royal Knights.
 The one who'll decide that is Mereoleona.
 Y-Yes, of course.
 Listen up, all of you!
 If we want to ambush the enemy and  throw them into a state of chaos,
 we can't let them know  how many of us there are,
 so splitting up is the best option.
 But the fact that there are so many entrances
 means that the enemy is  confident in their defense.
 The more we split up, the more that  may work against us and overwhelm us.
 So where does that lead us?
 Ooh, me!
 We'll overwhelm the enemy even  more with sheer willpower!
 We don't need willpower.  I'll overwhelm them myself.
 I wanna mash them all up!
 I shall defeat them beautifully on my own.
 I wish you'd just disappear.
 I'm surrounded by idiots.
 What's important is balance.
 The most effective way to get through  the enemy's defense while split up
 is to divide into five teams of four.
 Is that what you're thinking?
 Exactly.
 We will now split up into  five groups and proceed.
 I'll settle for anyone, as long as I don't  end up with the crazy stupid shrimp.
 Say what?! That's my line,  you cool masked jerk!
 Wait.
 No one would want to team up with you anyway,
 so I don't mind teaming  up with you after all.
 Why do you sound like you're taking  pity on me, you little shit?
 You're coming with me,  you damn problem children.
 Hello there, Lady Royal.
 Please accept this rainbow stinkbug  as a token of our friendship.
 You idiot!
 A stench this weak has no effect on me.
 You sure you want two peasants  hanging around you, Lady Royal?
 What?! You're a peasant, too?
 I don't care if you're a peasant or royalty.
 I've never given a rat's ass  about differences in status.
 All that matters is if you're weak or strong.
 You're here because you're strong,  are you not?
 The fools that Yami selected...
 Don't let me down.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Sure thing. Guess I'll  be careful, Lady Captain.
 The rest of you should also be proud  to be chosen as Royal Knights,
 and use your strengths to the fullest.
 I will now assign your positions.
 Group 1 En Ringard   Nils Ragus   Nozel Silva   Shiren Tium
 Group 1 will attack from the upper left.
 Yes, ma'am!
 As you wish.
 Group 2 Ben Benfunk   Luck Voltia   Noelle Silva   Kirsch Vermillion
 Group 2 will attack from the lower left.
 'Kay!
 Yes, ma'am.
 Group 3 Ruben Shagger   Rill Boismortier   Fragil Tormenta   Puli Angel
 Group 3 will attack from the upper right.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Group 4 will attack from the lower right.
 Group 4  Klaus Lunettes   Mimosa Vermillion   Yuno   Hamon Caseus
 Yes, ma'am!
 Group 5 Asta   Mereoleona Vermillion   Zora Ideale
 And we're going to attack front and center.
 Yes, ma'am!
 The spatial magic user will stand by here.
 Roger-dodger-roger!
 You'd better put your all into this.
 Let's go!
 Do you know why you're in this mess?
 It's because you're a citizen  of the Clover Kingdom.
 I was a citizen there myself,  until not so long ago.
 But...
 I was different.
 Lord Licht gave me my true name.
 We're special, you see.
 So we can do whatever we  want to trash like you.
 He's way too weak.
 There are stronger guys, right?
 Do leave me some chances  to strike beautifully.
 Are you all right?
 Thank you so much.
 I'm sure you don't need detailed plans.
 Take down any enemies you encounter  as you proceed toward the center.
 You may do that
 however you prefer!
 I don't care what you do  as long as you don't lose.
 Ah, the ants show themselves at last.
 I hear you caused quite a mess at  the royal capital while I was away.
 You will not escape like you  did from a certain cave.
 Eye of the Midnight Sun, we've come...
 ...to get our revenge.
 How dare you do that to my rival...
 To my foolish little brother...
 You shall pay dearly!
 I will be the one to take your leader's head!
 H-Holy crap!
 Wait, do we even need to be here?!
 Looks like someone dangerous showed up.
 Licht is gone right now, too.
 Guess I shouldn't be so lazy  about this and just go.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Lazy Raia!
 Lazy Raia!
 Lord Raia! Lord Raia!
 What's up? Why are you so panicked?
 We're being attacked!
 Sounds like it.
 But it's such a pain to deal with them.
 What?! Please don't be like that!
 It's a pain to get up.
 I shall sit you up.
 It's a pain to put shoes on.
 I shall do that, too!
 It's a pain to stand up.
 Up you go.
 Walking is a huge pain!  Yeah, I'm not gonna do it.
 What?!
 Please reconsider!
 I think I was sleeping with my mouth open,  because my throat hurts...
 I'll give you this lollipop!
 What flavor is it?
 A-Apple...
 I guess I shouldn't be so  lazy about this and just go.
 What would've happened if  it was an orange lollipop?
 Come to think of it, I wonder how  Valtos and the others are doing.

 The Royal Knights infiltrated
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout,  which was a floating dungeon
 located in the strong magic  region known as Gravito Stones,
 and were headed toward its center.
 Their ultimate goal is to  defeat the leader, Licht.
 H-Holy crap!
 Wait, do we even need to be here?!
 Meanwhile, back at the Black  Bulls' hideout...
 Well, I'm heading out for a bit.
 Where are you going, Captain?
 Apparently, Golden Weird Mask Guy  wants to apologize for Langris's behavior.
 So I'm heading to the  Golden Dawn's headquarters.
 Actually, why the hell do I have to go?
 If he wants to apologize,  he should come over here.
 Then can I go see Marie, too?
 Of course not, you dumbass.
 What if we get an emergency mission?
 Tch.
 I'm going to go visit Finral.
 How long is that boy going to stay asleep?
 I hope he wakes up soon.
 I'm gonna go train!
 I'm gonna get even stronger!
 You can do it! Don't even worry about  not being picked for the Royal Knights,
 you virgin delinquent.
 Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you calling a virgin?!  And I'm not worried!
 I'm going to go find some delicious noms, la!
 You should all look forward to it, la!
 H-Have a safe trip!
 Come back soon.
 It gets lonely when the whole gang isn't here.
 Well, see ya. Make sure you don't let any  bandits take over the place or anything.
 Man... what a pain.
 Make sure you ask that quack  doctor how Finral's doing.
 Of course. Sure thing!
 Stronger... I'm gonna get stronger!
 Just wait, la... All of you delicious noms  that have grown just to be eaten...
 Me and my sheep cooks are coming for you, la!

 Fidget, fidget... Fidget, fidget...
 What the hell?
 It's not like we're going to do anything,
 but both Grey and Gordon are sitting near me.
 Fidget, fidget...
 It's probably because all  the rowdy guys are gone,
 but this is somehow really distracting.
 Fidget, fidget, blush, blush...
 It's nice spending time together,  just the three of us.
 We have so much to talk about,  and my heart is happy.
 I'm so excited.
 Hey!
 Want to exchange secrets?
 Though I already know all your secrets...
 Heheh.
 If we get a summons for a mission, I'll go,  so you two can rest in your own rooms.
 N-No! B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-But  th-th-th-th-th-th-that's...
 Oh, come on.
 If we get a mission,  of course I'm going with you.
 What the hell are they even saying?!
 Just go get some rest already.
 I'm telling you that I'll go so I can get some  more money to get presents for Marie.
 You don't need to hold back.
 It's so embarrassing, not using  my transformation magic
 and talking in my normal form.
 I wanted to form deeper bonds with  everyone at the Underwater Temple, too.
 But the others consider me a part of the team!
 So I should try to stay  myself in front of them!
 I didn't get to create deeper bonds with  everyone at the Star Festival, either.
 Gauche even complimented me on how I look!
 So I'm going to deepen my bonds  with the two of you today.
 As deep as I possibly can get them.
 I'm going to my room
 so I can concentrate on making  this doll of my goddess.
 Let me know if we get a mission.
 It's so embarrassing for you  two to see me like this,
 but it's even more embarrassing  to be left alone together
 and have him stare at me! I just can't!
 Then I'll go to your room, too.
 I don't care if it's messy.
 We went to the library together, after all!
 What the hell is wrong with these two?!
 I need to be more confident  and speak to him myself!
 G-G-G-G-G-Gauche, wh-wh-wh-wh-what...
 What's that you're making?
 Oh, this?
 The other day, when I became a nerd,  I realized how awesome figures are.
 So I'm making a 1/8th scale Marie!
 M-Marie?
 When I'm finished, I'll let you worship her.
 I-I see?
 I already knew
 that Gauche had an interest in dolls.
 The day that I can show you  my collection has come at last.
 Peeksies...
 My handmade Black Bulls dolls.
 They look just like everyone, don't they?
 V-V-V-Voodoo dolls?!
 So cute.
 I'm so scared!
 Seriously, you're terrifying.
 Huh?!
 I probably shouldn't be the one to say this,
 but if you want to get  along with everyone else,
 you need to make an effort to be friendlier.
 Starting with your face.
 M-My face?!
 Try smiling.
 Smiling?
 Go on.
 Ba-dump, ba-dump...
 That's terrifying!
 D'oh...
 D'oh... D'oh...
 I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
 Don't touch her.
 I-I won't!
 Where's the bathroom today?
 Today, it's on the second  floor on the far right.
 I guess I should've asked this sooner,
 but why do parts of this hideout  keep changing randomly?
 Who knows?
 It's been like this ever since I joined.
 Talk about a pain.
 I'm sure it's some kind of magic,  but what the hell is the point?
 P-P-P-P-P-P-Please come  back as soon as possible!
 I heard Charmy and Vanessa  talk about it before, but...
 I-I saw it, la! It was kind of floaty!
 It wasn't one of my sheep cooks! It was  something even more mysterious, la!
 I swear I wasn't seeing things!
 It was really there! It was a ghost.
 I'm telling the truth.
 What if it wasn't magic,  but was actually a ghost?
 Please don't make weird jokes like tha—
 What the hell are these things?!
 P-Please don't look at me!
 This is no time to be embarrassed!
 Hurry up and transform, damn it!
 So many of you came here  to be friends with me...
 The hell they did!
 I don't know what these guys are,  but this is obviously an enemy attack!
 Hurry up and get ready to fi—
 What the hell do you think you're doing?!
 So this is Asta's hideout.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun
 Sally
 Rades
 Sadly, Asta's not here today, though.
 I was hoping to dissect him while  he's still alive. What a shame.
 Sally, Asta's not your toy.
 He's my toy. And after I came all  this way to play with him, too...
 Eye of the Midnight Sun Valtos
 Sally, Rades... Don't forget our objective.
 But I'm sure I can get some other decent toys
 while I'm at the Black Bulls' hideout.
 I wanna conduct experiments! Dissections!
 Modifications! Operations!
 Wow!
 I don't know who the hell is dumb  enough to attack our hideout...
 But now you're gonna pay!
 There you are, you useless Magic Knights.
 You bastards...
 You know them, Gauche?
 Do I know them?
 They're from that dirtbag terrorist  group, the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 The Eye of...
 So what the hell do you want?
 Did you come to get your asses kicked again?
 Since you're pulling the strings on those  zombies, I'm assuming you're Rades.
 You assumed correctly.
 We happen to be looking for something.
 You're looking for something?
 What could you possibly want  from our broken-down hideout?
 I'm sure you guys wouldn't know about it,  but you've got something really good.
 If you're looking for friendship, it's right here.
 They're not!
 And as long as we're here looking for that,  we figured we'd also destroy your hideout.
 Oh? Then you can die!
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray!
 Gel Magic: Sticky Salamander!
 Whee!
 That's right... My magic  doesn't work on that woman.
 Tch.
 Come on, relax.
 Gauche, was it? I have no  interest in you, anyway.
 We've been told to not kill you, so...
 Huh?
 What are you talking about?
 Who knows? I'm not really sure,  but Master Licht insisted.
 The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun?
 Actually, before...
 I couldn't...
 risk hurting you...
 What are you talking about?
 What? You know him?  Sorry I beat the crap out of him.
 Of course I don't know this bastard.
 You'll understand eventually...
 I guess he did say that...
 So, let's play.
 Are you ready, Black Bulls losers?
 Now's not the time to think about that.
 For now, I've gotta do something  about these bastards.
 The captain and the others probably  won't be back for a while,
 so the three of us will take care of them!
 There ya go.
 Dark Magic Item:  Special Properties Plus Alpha Reinforcement!
 All right! Let's go!
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun... The really  bad people who hurt my friends...
 Stay away from our hideout.
 Poison Curse Magic: Aufwachen Dachs.
 Since we're dealing with the dead,  I don't have to hold back with my magic.
 Damn, man.
 Oho... That's some impressive poison.
 But if we're playing with poison...
 I'll just neutralize it with my gel!
 G-Gauche!
 I learned a new spell!
 T-Transformation Magic: Magic Conversion!
 She turned my gel magic...
 ...into crystal magic?
 N-Now, Gauche!
 Right! Now I can actually crack it!
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrain!
 Oho!
 Ooh, you can change the properties of  magic itself. That's pretty interesting!
 I think I'm a little interested in you now!
 P-P-P-Please don't look at me!
 That's the way. This'll make  crushing you guys even more fun.
 Valtos!
 Right.
 You're up, Number Zero...
 Mikael Caesar.
 What the hell is that creepy thing?
 Do it.
 It used two different  magic attributes at once?
 And why the hell is it so powerful?
 Making this guy was a pain in the ass, you know.
 He was only completed because I helped  you with some dark magic items.
 You'd better be grateful.
 That thing's made from two different corpses.
 Both of those corpses used to be  Magic Knights Squad captains!
 You'll never be able to  defeat my perfect corpses
 with your stupid little tricks!
 Hurry up and destroy this stupid  Magic Knights Squad hideout!
 Let's go.
 Stop it...
 Since I was born into a family that dealt with  curses, I wasn't allowed to make friends.
 So I ended up unable to speak to people,  and had this hideous poison magic.
 I was shunned by everyone around me.
 Stop it...
 Because I was unable to be self-confident and couldn't reveal my true self,
 people didn't trust me and  were creeped out by me.
 I was all alone.
 But even then...
 But even then...
 You're hilarious! Come join my squad!
 A bull! That's friggin' awesome!
 I-I'm awesome?
 I'm happy that you're all having fun.
 You'll be even happier after  eating a lot of delicious noms, la!
 Maybe he'll be able to speak louder someday.
 It's delicious.
 This cooking made with love is filling  not only my stomach, but my heart, too.
 Happy birthday, la!
 Come on, let's drink!
 Th-Thank you very much!
 He's fast asleep.
 This one's Asta and this one's Grey?
 Wait, maybe the other way around?
 Either way, your muscles are creepy.
 This place...
 This place...
 ...accepted me for who I am!
 What the hell are we supposed  to do with this freak?!
 Don't give up, Gauche.
 We're going to protect our hideout!
 For crying out loud... I guess you can speak loud and clear!
 Damn it...
 Now I have things I want to protect
 besides Marie!
 And once the captain gets back,
 who knows what he'll do to us if  we couldn't protect the hideout?
 Wow, they can still stand.
 But I think it's about time  I dissected you guys.
 Having a lot of spirit isn't gonna help you.
 It doesn't change the fact  that you guys can't win.
 Now, I'm gonna finish you off!
 Make sure you don't kill them, though.
 I'm gonna dissect them  while they're still alive.
 Don't hold your breath on that one.
 Go, Mikael Caesar!
 Emergency! Emergency!
 What the?
 It's floating?
 What's going on?
 Emergency! Emergency!
 What's... going... on... here?

 Please don't look at me!
 Don't listen to my voice, either!  Cover your ears!
 But then we can't do our comedy routine.
 W-Well, I can't tell what  you're saying anyway,
 so how can we even do a comedy routine?
 Well, you got me there. Hahaha.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Asta and the other Royal Knights  finally got to the
 Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout.
 The fight to get to the  center of the hideout,
 where their leader Licht  should be, had begun.
 Around the same time, the Black Bulls'  hideout was being attacked.
 The ones who attacked were  Rades, Sally, and Valtos
 from the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Gauche, Gordon, and Grey stepped up to protect their hideout,
 but the enemy's brutal attack  put them in a dire situation.
 Don't give up, Gauche.
 We're going to protect our hideout!
 Now, I'm gonna finish you off!
 Emergency! Emergency!
 What's... going... on... here?
 Crazy Magic Battle
 What was that shaking?
 Curse that Rades. He must be  doing something reckless again.
 Who the hell are you?
 Wh-What are you doing in our hideout?
 He's creepy.
 You're in no place to say that!
 Answer me! Who the hell are you?!
 Well... you... see... my... name... is...
 He talks so slow...
 What are you doing in our hideout?
 Who are you?!
 Well... you... see...
 We didn't get to hear his name  because you talked to him again!
 Not my problem!
 Oh? I was pretty sure there were only
 three people at the Black Bulls'  hideout right now.
 Like it even matters.
 We just need to kill anyone  who gets in our way!
 Get him, Mikael Caesar!
 Wha?!
 He dodged it by rearranging the hideout?
 What the hell was that, you jackass?!
 Well... you... see... my... name... is...
 We're starting from there again?!
 So slow!
 Charmy and Vanessa were  talking about some ghost
 that rearranged our hideout...
 Could he actually be that ghost?
 You actually exist?
 No... He's still alive.  No doubt about it. I can feel it.
 How the hell can you tell?!
 Also, when did I start to  understand what you're saying?!
 I'm incredible!
 His hair!
 Wow...
 Hey... little... friends. You're... so... warm.
 He keeps birds in his hair...
 I want to be friends with them.
 I don't know what kind of  ability that's supposed to be,
 but if all you can do is shake up a  building, you can't attack or defend!
 What?
 What's going on?
 What?! He blocked it?
 Wow, that's awesome!
 That thing looks like a hand!
 Now's not the time to be happy!
 The hideout...
 He's got complete control over it.
 Well done, my new friend.
 You... need... to... stop...  attacking... now.
 You talk too damn slow!
 Talk faster, damn it!
 This must be similar to that geezer's  game magic from the Underwater Temple.
 Magic that utilizes  specific things and places.
 The mage is usually very  familiar with the object
 and has been pouring magic into it  regularly, making it immensely potent.
 To use magic on such a huge scale...  How long has he been in our hideout?
 The hideout is always changing around inside.
 Does that mean he's always been there?!
 Has his magic always...
 Gordon... Grey... Gauche...
 You...
 You know us?
 Of... course... I... do.
 I... mean...
 Because... I...
 Are you the resident ghost that  everyone keeps talking about?
 Well... I'm... not...  actually... a... ghost.
 Heya, I'm Yami Sukehiro.
 I just became a Magic Knights Squad captain recently,
 and I'm looking for a hideout.
 This place is pretty sweet.
 I like it. You mind if I have it?
 I didn't mind giving it to him.
 But I was born with a strange  illness that left me unable to move,
 so I told him that.
 I told him that I can only  live within this house,
 that I can't interact with others very much,
 and that, to top it off,  I unfortunately had to borrow
 bits of magical power from  others in order to survive.
 I told him all about my strange disease.
 I'm unsure if I was abandoned or  they were in some kind of accident,
 but my parents had disappeared a few  months before Yami showed up.
 No one would bother to come and see  someone as troublesome as me.
 That's how I felt.
 I was going to die soon...  so I asked him to wait until then.
 But then he said...
 Yeah, no.
 Huh?
 It'd be creepy to have a  hideout that someone died in,
 not to mention unlucky.
 I need you to live.
 But... I...
 Basically, you just need a lively bunch  of people to live here, right?
 You probably had no idea,
 but I know about all of you.
 You probably had no idea,  but all of you kept me alive.
 You probably had no idea about me,
 but you're all my precious friends.
 Well... you... see...  my... name... is...
 Henry Legolant
 Henry.
 Henry?
 That's a great name.  I'll make a Henry doll right away.
 I don't give a damn who you are!
 Destroy that rickety building!
 I... won't... let... you... do... that.
 I sense mana coming from here.
 There it is.
 Back then...
 This is the magic stone that Heath  failed to retrieve from Saussy.
 To think it was here...  And we finally have it.
 What's going on?
 Recombination Magic: The Raging Black Bull
 Recombination Magic:  The Raging Black Bull.
 I... won't... forgive...
 I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt
 my precious friends.
 He transformed the hideout?!
 What the hell?!
 Wow! How's he doing that?
 I want him for a specimen!
 Well done, my good friend!
 What kind of magic does he have that  lets him move something that big?!
 Well... it's not just... my magical powers.
 It's the accumulation of all the magical power
 that I've received from all of you,
 and I'm using it all at once!
 This is the mana power of  all of the Black Bulls!
 Thanks to all of you,  even though I was bedridden,
 I could start wandering around  the hideout a few years ago.
 So you really were the ""ghost""!
 I still can't control my condition,
 so if I get too close, I'll end up taking too  much magical power away from them.
 So I can't go see them face-to-face.
 But...
 One of them got lost in the hideout  once and ended up in my room.
 He found out about me.
 And he told me that he  didn't have any magic,
 so I didn't have to worry  about stealing any from him.
 He'd come by my room sometimes to visit.
 That's right...
 I'm one of the Black Bulls, too.
 Crap. You're sucking quite a bit of magical  power from me, so I'm gonna head out.
 I don't see a way around it,  so you're a member of my squad now.
 Huh?
 One day, when you can move and  want to protect your buddies,
 you can put that on.
 When I want to protect... them?
 Now is that time!
 A Black Bulls' robe?
 He's one of us?
 Just because you're huge
 doesn't mean you're any  match for my Number Zero!
 Mana Corkscrew!
 Wh-What?!
 Mana Rocket Punch!
 What the heck is this insane magic?!
 What are you doing, Mikael Caesar?!
 I know that's not all you've got!
 Quit dawdling! Get your  ass back up and fight!
 It's a pretty sturdy corpse  that doesn't feel any pain...
 But if he takes another hit like that, he might be crushed to bits.
 He seems like he'd be  pretty fun to dissect.
 I guess it wouldn't hurt to show  off the results of my research.
 Dark Magic Item:  Magic Scorpion Necklace!
 It only lasts about ten minutes...
 But it multiplies my  magical power tenfold!
 Gel Magic:
 Big Ol' Sticky Salamander!
 What?! That thing just became huge!
 Here we go!
 Go...
 Raging Black Bull!
 Mana Corkscrew!
 Like punching gel is going  to accomplish anything.
 Now it's my turn!
 Hup!
 Dark Magic Item: Special  Properties Plus Alpha!
 Raise the gel's viscosity!
 Whoa...
 That weird magic of yours is interesting,
 but so is that bizarre body of yours!
 Now, what should I do next?
 Good work, Sally! Get him!
 That's not good! We need to back him up!
 Right!
 We're coming, my dear friend!
 B-B-But how?!
 Gordon's magic and mine are  horrible matches with that woman's!
 Grey, use your magic to change  the attribute of her magic!
 I-I can't! N-Not with  something that big!
 You'll be fine! Hey, Grey!
 Y-Yes?!
 Look at me!
 Mirror Magic: Mirror Brigade!
 Sh-She multiplied?!
 Wowie!
 P-Please don't look at me!

 Wha—
 Don't you dare...
 lay a finger on my friends!
 What?!
 All right!
 All right!
 D-D-Don't...
 Don't screw with me!
 I'm gonna have to show you  losers my trump card now!
 Whoopsie... I'm feeling kinda dizzy.
 Maybe I used a little too much mana.
 Wait.
 Valtos!
 That guy again... Where the  hell was he this whole time?
 I've obtained what we came here for.
 Let's go.
 Huh?! You can't be serious!
 We can't go back like this!
 We cannot let this mission fail,  no matter what.
 I will not indulge your  selfishness this time.
 Screw you, Black Bulls!
 Just so we're clear,  I'm not running away!
 Bye-bye. Let's play  together again sometime!
 I'm gonna kill you next time,  so you better be ready!
 All is as Master Licht wills it...
 You can't be serious!
 Come back here, you Eye of  the Midnight Sun bastards!
 What the hell was all that?
 What did they take from our hideout?!
 I'm not sure, but we won!
 We worked so well together in this fight.  It'll be a wonderful memory.
 Th-Thank goodness we and  the hideout are all safe!
 I'm not sure if we can call this ""safe.""
 Hey! Can you turn the hideout back to normal?
 Well... you... see...
 If my Marie collection's  damaged, I'll kill you!
 We... might... be... screwed.
 What?!
 Marie!
 Could you tell me more about yourself?
 I don't have enough energy  to transform anymore!
 Master Licht...
 Leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun Licht
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 It appears you've obtained it.
 Well, duh!
 I have it here.
 Excellent work.
 What a beautiful day.
 The laundry should be dry in no time.
 You're right.
 Something is...
 What's the matter, Sister?
 Oh, it's nothing.
 Man, that golden weird  mask captain sure is late.
 Now only two remain...
 Until the monument of the Tree of Life  can bring forth our true power.
 And then, the day that our dream  will come true shall be upon us.
 Yes.
 Finally!
 We can finally kill  all those Magic Knights!
 I can't wait!
 Where are the remaining magic stones?
 We'll go get those for you, too.  Leave it to us!
 We await your orders.
 Yes, thank you.
 But I am the only one who  can obtain the last two.
 Master Licht...
 You should get some rest.
 I shall go...
 Myself.
 The leader of the Eye of  the Midnight Sun, Licht,
 continues the preparations  necessary to his ambitions...
 while Asta and the others are  fighting to stop those ambitions!
 Eye of the Midnight Sun, we've come...
 ...to get our revenge.
 How dare you do that to my rival...
 To my foolish little brother...
 You shall pay dearly!
 I will be the one to take your leader's head!
 Looks like someone dangerous has shown up.
 Licht is gone right now, too.
 Guess I've gotta stop being lazy and just go.

 We will soon be reborn...  in our true forms!
 True forms? What are you talking about?
 What are these patterns on the walls?
 The deeper we go,  the more patterns there are.
 It's unsettling.
 What's the matter, Yuno?
 Quiet.

 You can clone yourself?

 Uh, it's not like I wanted another me!
 So which one's the fake?  They've even copied his lack of magic.
 Can you tell which one's the real one?

 It's simple magic, but insanely powerful.
 She's more combat-oriented than  any mage I've encountered before.
 Holy crap! She's not fighting long-range,  but getting right up in his face!
 If she's fighting up close, I might  be able to use her techniques later!
 Heck yeah!
 Copy Magic: Healing Light Particles.
 He healed right back up again!
 Okay, I'm gonna fight, too... huh?
 If you don't want to be killed,  just shut up and watch.
 What?!
 She's definitely gonna be more  trouble than anyone else here.
 But, I mean...
 There's no point in getting a big head  over magic you stole from us, royal.
 Copy Magic: Light Swords of Conviction.
 I doubt she can keep up with this speed.
 Next.
 Hot, hot, hot, hot!
 Man, Lady Sisgoleon's super fast!
 What's with these... superhuman movements?
 Copy Magic: Invisible Seeker.
 He's copying people left and right.  Dunno whose spell that is, but...
 I'm pretty sure
 that one's a spell the former  captain of the Purple Orcas used!
 Copy Magic: Aqua Javelin!
 She changed directions in midair?
 Next!
 And her reaction times are as fast as Vetto's.
 You're not getting away!
 Copy Magic: Tainted Culvert Wyrm!
 How do you like the most powerful  water spell I can use right now?
 Copy Magic: Salamander's Breath!
 Next!
 She just burns right through water magic,
 the attribute she's weakest against, and flame magic, too?
 Ugh, you're a pain in the ass!
 What's wrong? Is that all you've got?!
 Invisible—
 Next!
 Copy Magic: Sticky Salamander!
 Next!
 Copy Magic: Jötunn's Ice Floe!
 Calidos Brachium!
 Next!
 She's a beast.
 Mereoleona Vermillion... She's  definitely as crazy as the rumors say.
 I did a little research.
 The royal capital was too stuffy for her,
 and she wanted to eat the meat of wild beasts,
 so for more than 300 days out of the year,
 she's like a beast herself, living out in the wilderness.
 Delicious!
 She steeped herself in  the natural world's mana,
 and her Mana Skin reached a higher level  while she lived out there, or so they say.
 That's apparently true,  judging by her monster moves.
 I've never even heard of  this Raia guy's copy magic,
 but I'm starting to understand.
 His copy magic can mimic spell attributes.
 That means he's a crazy bastard who  can use every possible attribute.
 And the strength of his spells reflects his  tremendous amount of magical power.
 So even if he copies some  random, average mage,
 his version of the spell  will be even more powerful.
 But... when he's activating one spell,
 he can't use another spell with a  different attribute at the same time.
 That he lifted his invisibility to fire a spell proves that.
 Even so, most people wouldn't stand a  chance against a guy this overpowered.
 But this time...
 Lady Sisgoleon is awesome!
 Can I steal any of this? Even a little bit?
 This is such a pain in the ass...
 Then how about this?
 My sword?!
 How the hell did he manage that?
 I thought there was some kind of  condition he had to follow to copy...
 I need to touch another's grimoire  to be able to copy their magic.
 Earlier, when I was transformed,
 I casually snuck in and touched it.
 Licht...
 Copy magic, eh?
 Well, I'm empty inside, so I  guess it's sorta perfect for me.
 You're kinder than anyone, Raia.
 Huh? What are you talking about, Licht?
 You look at people carefully,  and you like everyone.
 That's probably why your  magic is like that.
 I like everyone?
 It's a kind magic that can't be used  without watching others closely.
 Kind? You're wrong, Licht.
 I'm a liar, a slacker, and disloyal.
 Licht, a man who was genuinely  kind, said that I was kind...
 and you people tricked and killed him.
 Look at how many of you crawled out.  There are hordes of you now!
 Humans... I'll kill every last one of you!
 Looks like that was just a copy of its form.  You couldn't copy its anti-magic.
 So you just hit it without any hesitation?
 If I could've copied his anti-magic,  your fist would've been shattered!
 Not to mention, the feel of this mana... This woman's strength...
 It's not just the royalty's magic power!
 It's a human strength that  we're not familiar with.
 Are you done with your spells?
 In that case...
 She's surpassed Mana Skin and begun  controlling mana across the area.
 Let's end this!
 Mana Zone Calidos Brachium Barrage!
 What's the matter,  last member of the Third Eye?
 Is that all you've got?!
 He didn't even stand a chance.
 I don't even have time to use  any rapid recovery spells.
 To think she'd be able to  use a Mana Zone attack...
 Mana Zone: the ability to harness  the mana that's floating in
 the surrounding area and control  that territory at will.
 Basically, within that territory,  you can discharge more mana than you
 personally have in any direction.
 Where's your next attack? Don't you have anything else?!
 Also, your detection abilities  grow astoundingly sharp,
 and your reaction speed increases.
 By borrowing the power of mana, you can move freely, even through space!
 That woman is insane.
 We had such a hard time with the Third Eye, and she's mopping the floor with one of them...
 Captain Mereoleona is so awesome!
 If that's all you've got,
 I'm just going to keep punching  you until you disappear!
 Burn to ash!
 Well, shit.
 Wind Magic: Tornado Fang Triple Strike!
 Sorry, but people at your  level can't stop me anymore.
 Nice, Yuno!
 He unleashed a spell  from behind the enemy.
 Was that the ability  people call Mana Zone?
 Come to think of it, when he generated  a spell inside that other spell...
 And that Spirit Dive power...
 Mana Zone made all that possible!
 Yuno... You have such  overwhelming ability!
 That sound...
 We heard it earlier, too.
 A heartbeat?
 The feel of this mana... I've felt it before.
 The Royal Knights, eh?
 I guess I'll play with you a little longer.
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 92:

 Go on, Licht. Defeat the Wizard King.

92,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Royal Knights arrived at the  Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout.
 They headed for its center,
 where they believed the leader  Licht was, with no opposition.
 But...
 We seriously have nothing to do!
 Who gave you permission to  make another one of you?
 Uh, it's not like I wanted another me!
 You're the fake!
 No, that's you!
 Knock it off.
 She just set them both on fire.
 What are you doing?!  Are you trying to kill me?!
 I don't remember bringing along someone
 weak enough to be killed by that.
 The true identity of the fake Asta  was the last member of the Third Eye,
 Raia the Disloyal.
 The all-incinerating spell  of total destruction...
 Flame Magic:
 Calidos Brachium!
 Thus began an intense fight between  flame magic and copy magic.
 Eventually, Mereoleona's magic and  attack power began to overtake Raia.
 Meanwhile, Yuno and his team  continued to the center.
 Sorry, but people at your  level can't stop me anymore.
 That sound...
 We heard it earlier, too.
 A heartbeat?
 The feel of this mana... I've felt it before.
 Also during that time...
 Back at the Black Bulls' hideout,
 which had been attacked by  the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 W-We somehow managed to chase them off,
 but something awful still happened!
 I hope they never come back.
 U-Um... Could you turn the  hideout back to normal now?
 I can't... I have no magic.
 So he says, Gauche.
 Where is it? Where is it, damn it?!
 Where's all my Marie merchandise?!
 Probably smashed to bits... Squishy, squish...
 Stop saying such awful things so slowly!
 Get down here and help me, damn it!
 But I...
 Just shut up and get down here,  you slow-ass, long-haired jerk!
 U-Um, Gauche...
 I wouldn't do that.
 Come down here!
 But I...
 Don't ""But I..."" me!  Get down here or I'll kill you!
 Okay, then...
 Tch. Took you long eno—
 H-Henry absorbs your magic  if he gets too close!
 We tried to stop you.
 I found it!
 Thank goodness! It's safe!
 Nothing inside got smashed, and nothing's dirt—
 M-Marie's... cheek...
 I'll kill you! I'm going to murder  all of you, Eye of the Midnight Sun!
 But they're gone now...
 Shut up! I'll kill you, too, while I'm at it!
 Sorry about that...
 Give me back my magic, damn it!
 I can't...
 I said give it back!
 I can't...
 Anyway... Why did the  Eye of the Midnight Sun attack?
 They said they ""obtained"" something.
 They were probably just bluffing.
 Nothing here is more important  than my Marie merchandise.
 Were they after my dolls?
 I don't think so...
 Well, if there's anything  else that's important...
 What is it?
 Is it me?
 Tch. It's nothing!
 More importantly, why isn't Captain  Yami back yet at a time like this?
 Indeed...
 He told us not to let the hideout be taken over
 Golden Dawn Headquarters
 by bandits while he was gone, too...
 What is he, a prophet?
 The Wizard King vs.  The Leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun
 Hey, isn't he from the Black Bulls?
 Why is he here?
 Apparently, he's waiting  for Captain Vangeance.
 He's been here for quite a while now.
 Should we say something to him?
 But he seems sorta angry.
 You go talk to him!
 No, you!
 What the hell are you looking at, huh?
 Sir Yami...
 W-Would you like more tea?
 Sure... But just how much tea  are you gonna make me drink?!
 There's so much tea sloshing  around in my stomach,
 I've been running to the bathroom constantly!
 You wanna literally detox the shit out of me?!
 I don't feel refreshed at all, damn it!
 I-I'm terribly sorry!
 Hey, how long is that golden  weird mask guy captain of yours
 going to make me wait after he  said he wanted to apologize?
 H-He should be here any second.
 P-Please, have some more tea.
 Sure.
 Didn't I just say there's enough tea  sloshing around in my stomach?!
 I-I'm terribly sorry!
 Damn it... My ride's in the shop right now,
 so it was a pain in the  ass to get here, too.
 You know, your vice captain was  the one who put my ride in the shop
 after the Royal Knights Selection Exam.
 Finral's still in the hospital  and hasn't woken up.
 I also hear that the questioning of your  vice captain isn't getting far, either.
 Shouldn't your golden weird mask  captain come to me to apologize?
 Are you Golden Dawn jerks messing with me?
 Such pressure...
 W-We sincerely apologize for  what Vice Captain Langris did.
 But I ask that you have faith  in Captain Vangeance.
 He is a wonderful person.
 He would never knowingly insult you.
 Who the hell are you?
 I'm no one suspicious.
 Everything about you is suspicious!
 Yami, was it?
 I'm counting on you to watch my back.
 This guy moves like he can read my mind.
 Our ki goes together.
 How many years has it been since then?
 We both became captains.
 I'm someone who believes his gut instincts.
 Vangeance...
 Could you take off that mask?
 You suspect that I may be the leader of  the Eye of the Midnight Sun, don't you?
 I feel something similar in you...
 So just let me see your face, all right?
 I was born with it.
 They called me a cursed child.
 I'm glad I was able to tell you and  show you things as they really are.
 Thank you, Yami.
 It didn't feel like he was lying.
 Sir Yami, please just wait a little longer.
 He would never...
 Tch.
 I know that, you dumbasses.
 Lord Julius, are you here? Lord Julius?
 Honestly, the moment I  take my eyes off of him...
 He needs to realize that  he's the Wizard King.
 Work just keeps piling up.
 I can't even get through to  him with communication magic.
 Right about now...
 The Royal Knights are having
 the last battle with the Eye of  the Midnight Sun at their hideout.
 I wish I could join in, but I've watched  over them this whole time, so I know...
 Their strength and
 their desire to protect the citizens  of this kingdom are real.
 It'll be all right...  I know they can do this.
 Not to mention, Marx will get mad at me.
 I must do what I'm meant to do.
 It's not often you to ask to  discuss something with me.
 What's on your mind, William?
 Thank you for making time  for me, Lord Julius.
 You never cared about how I looked,
 and were the first person to ever  acknowledge my strength.
 The path to my future  opened once I met you.
 I grew up as a cursed child in a  small village in the Forsaken Realm,
 and though I was welcomed into  a noble family as its heir,
 I was treated terribly.
 But...
 Little boy, what kind of magic is that?
 You were different.
 You truly acknowledged my power and  invited me into the Magic Knights.
 It really is nothing to worry about,  but if you are so worried about it...
 In that case...
 When you gave me this mask...  When you invited into the Magic Knights...
 I decided that I would dedicate  my grimoire to your service.
 It's been eleven years since then,
 and my feelings have not  changed in the least.
 I have always respected you, Lord Julius.
 Jeez, what brought all this on?  You're making me blush.
 That is why I climbed up the ranks to  become a Magic Knights Squad captain,
 chose highly capable squad members  that my mana pointed out to me,
 and created the Golden Dawn.
 I believed that making the ultimate
 Magic Knights Squad would be  the best way to repay you.
 And that was also...
 for the sake of the other person who is deeply important to me.
 My friend who has always been with me,  even before I met you, Lord Julius.
 From here on out, you two will wish  to walk completely different paths.
 Both of you are very dear to me.
 I cannot choose between you.
 And so...
 You two will have to choose for me.
 His scar...
 Thank you, William...  My one and only human friend.
 Good day to you,  Wizard King Julius Novachrono.
 I am the leader of the  Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.
 I had really hoped that wasn't the case.
 William... I always knew that  you were hiding something.
 That there was a side of you that  you didn't want to be known.
 I'm sure Yami realized this, too.
 It could be that Fuegoleon was also
 caught off-guard when he  saw who you really were.
 The day that the royal capital was  attacked by the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 The uneasy feeling I felt when  I faced their leader, Licht...
 That somewhat familiar mana...
 And right around the time I injured his arm,
 I started seeing you only rarely.
 I couldn't help but harbor my doubts,
 though I couldn't bring myself  to believe that it was true.
 But...
 Who would've thought that there  were two souls in one body?
 So it was you, but at the  same time, it wasn't you.
 How did you get rid of that scar? It doesn't seem to be the work of magic.
 That scar is a curse cast upon  the clan of this body's mother.
 No curse cast upon humans  has anything to do with me.
 I despise humans.
 But William... He was the  only one that was different.
 We were able to share the  same body, after all.
 Despite being human, he accepted  my feeling and understood them.
 This uncontrollable rage,  sadness, and hatred.
 We're just like this bird.
 Because it can fly, like we can use special magic,
 they envy and want to hurt us.
 But I believe that one day, we and the humans will be able to understand each other.
 But I was wrong.
 I was surprised that your brother  felt the same way I do.
 I also feel the same way.
 I hope that elves and humans can  live together peacefully someday.
 Because if that doesn't happen...
 Tetia...
 I'm sure we'll all understand  each other someday.
 Yes!
 If I had never met those humans,
 we would've never...
 There is only one way to be rid of
 these overflowing emotions.
 We shall collect all of the magic  stones and fulfill our hearts' desire!
 So their motive is to get  revenge against the humans.
 And having all of the magic stones  will make that possible?
 William understood, too.
 That's why he let me see you.
 You have the remaining two, don't you?
 Yes, because that's the safest option.
 I shall obtain those magic stones,  and we shall fulfill our hearts' desire.
 William... You are a kind person.
 The fact that there was  another in your body
 and you treasured him  so well this whole time
 is also part of your kindness.
 And it is my job, as someone who's  also important to you, to stop him.
 You support me, which means I'll win.
 No... His heart is with me.
 Wizard King, I'm afraid  you're going to die.
 As the Wizard King, the most  powerful mage in this land,
 you will take responsibility for all the sins
 the humans in the Clover Kingdom  have committed.
 Light Creation Magic:  Light Swords of Conviction.
 Mana Zone: Chrono Stasis Grigora.
 Light magic is the fastest  among all magical attributes.
 But that doesn't mean it's unstoppable.
 I see.
 But I wonder how long that can last.
 This man's magic is a type  that controls the flow of time.
 He can slow time down to  almost a complete halt,
 bind it, speed it up tremendously,  or even destroy it...
 A single attack can be lethal.
 But I sense a sort of destiny
 in that, ironic though it is,  I was born with light magic.
 The only thing that can oppose time...
 is light.
 Light Creation Magic:  Light Whip of Judgment!
 He uses a combination of Mana Zone  and time acceleration.
 By accelerating time for  the mana around him,
 he can read the flow of  the mana in the future,
 which lets him sense the very near future
 and anticipate attacks.
 But don't think...
 that you can actually outdo me.
 Too slow.
 Even if you can see what's ahead, there are limits to how quickly you can evade.
 Has it been a while since you  were last wounded, Wizard King?
 It has. I've taken the  futures of many people,
 but it's been a while since  I've seen my own blood.
 Your time-controlling magic  isn't so invincible anymore.
 The true nature of my magic is  to steal time from my target.
 That time gets stockpiled,  and I can use it at any time,
 though it takes a lot out of me.
 He reversed time and healed his wound?
 As someone who was born with  magic that steals futures,
 my goal as the Wizard King is to create  a future without discrimination.
 Until that future happens, I cannot die.
 A future without discrimination,  but with humans? That's an impossible dream!
 At that speed, it's taking everything  you have to evade this attack.
 You cannot fight back,  or even get close to me.
 I have you now!
 Wha—
 He's anticipating even faster!
 I can already see your future.
 You cannot defeat me.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Anticipation
 Anticipation.
 I've already read all of your moves.
 So you can anticipate what'll  happen in the near future...
 In that case, guess what  I'm about to do next.
 Very well. Mana Zone:  Chrono Stasis Grigora.
 You're about to break into a nimble dance.
 And then...
 There!
 A dove will fly out of your hat...
 Hup!
 You'll spin a ball on an umbrella,
 quickly remove a tablecloth without  spilling what's in the glasses...
 And then you'll mimic the sounds  that various animals make.
 Well? You can't do that, now, can you?
 Who knew that you were so talented?
 I had really hoped that wasn't the case.
 You cannot defeat me.
 I am the Wizard King.
 It is my duty to protect this  kingdom and all of its people.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Yami was visiting the  Golden Dawn's headquarters
 in order to meet with Vangeance, but...
 How long is that golden  weird mask guy captain of yours
 going to make me wait after he  said he wanted to apologize?
 H-He should be here any second.
 Are you Golden Dawn jerks messing with me?
 Yami continued to wait for Vangeance, whom he trusted
 because they had fought for this kingdom
 and become Magic Knights  Squad captains together.
 But at that time...
 Vangeance revealed his other self, which  he had kept hidden, to the Wizard King.
 He was the Captain of the Golden Dawn,  William Vangeance,
 but also the leader of the  Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.
 Thank you, William...  My one and only human friend.
 Good day to you,  Wizard King Julius Novachrono.
 I am the leader of the  Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.
 I had really hoped that wasn't the case.
 Licht fought Julius so he  could steal the magic stones
 that Julius had and exact his  revenge against the humans.
 Julius was able to anticipate Licht's attacks
 with his time magic and fight back.
 I have you now!
 Wha—
 He's anticipating even faster!
 I can already see your future.
 You cannot defeat me.
 Julius Novachrono
 Look over there!
 The castle tower...
 S-Something's shining...
 What in the world is going on?
 This way!
 Over there!
 This magic... It's Lord Julius.
 He's battling with someone.
 Someone who uses light magic and  can keep up with Lord Julius...
 Could it be...
 The leader of the Eye of  the Midnight Sun, Licht?
 But the Royal Knights should be working  on eliminating them as we speak.
 How did he get into the castle?
 Was he also the one who shut down my  communication magic with Lord Julius?
 There are too many unknowns...
 Wh-What's going on?
 Is Lord Julius fighting?
 What should we do?
 Please, calm down.
 This is the moment our strength  will be put to the test.
 We cannot protect this kingdom  if we're panicking like this!
 Yes. Calm down.
 It's my job to remain  calm at times like this.
 Even if we were to assist in the fight,
 we're nowhere near their level.  We'd only get in the way.
 There's no way Lord Julius should lose,
 but if all else fails, the only ones  who could keep up in this battle are
 Magic Knights Squad captains or their equals!
 I need to send a message to all the  Magic Knights Squad headquarters I've marked!
 What?
 Sis!
 Communication magic?
 It's a message from the royal capital, bah-ha.
 This is an urgent message to all  Magic Knights Squad captains!
 The Wizard King is fighting a  man believed to be the leader
 of the Eye of the Midnight Sun  right now at Clover Castle!
 They might be putting  some plan into motion,
 like the previous attack  on the royal capital.
 All Magic Knights should follow orders from  their captains and guard their districts.
 Captains, as soon as your  districts are secure,
 please meet at the royal  capital immediately!
 Wh-What's going on?
 Captain Mereoleona should be attacking  their hideout as we speak.
 The leader of the Eye of the Midnight  Sun is at the royal capital?
 This could be my only chance to avenge my brother.
 But...
 What's with those pathetic  looks on your faces?
 And you call yourselves members  of the proud Crimson Lion Kings?!
 Yes, sir!
 Remember the words of my brother!
 Remain calm at all times!
 While my sister is gone,
 we will prepare for a possible attack
 by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,  as we were ordered!
 H-He's right!
 This is no time to panic!
 We're the Crimson Lion Kings!
 How could this have happened?  How did they get into the royal capital?
 Please hurry and return,  Captain Vangeance.
 It couldn't be...
 Please let me be wrong.
 Your individual blows  are becoming a bit dull.
 At this rate, I won't even have to  anticipate your moves to dodge them.
 He can keep up with  me even at this speed?
 Just how far into the future  can he anticipate?
 You can have this back.
 He sped up my spell.
 Well, you certainly came close.
 You're pretty fast.
 Even reading your moves, I still  haven't been able to capture you.
 What is behind this man's strength?
 He's just an ordinary human. So why...
 I'd really appreciate it  if you'd just give up now.
 I'd rather not wound Vangeance's body.
 The reason he isn't fighting back is because he wants to capture me alive.
 He still has plenty of strength.
 To fight against me, despite my four-leaf grimoire...
 Where is it? Where is his grimoire?
 What kind of...
 Are you curious about my grimoire?
 My grimoire is right up there.
 Why does it look like that?
 It doesn't even have a cover!  That grimoire is...
 Time magic and a grimoire  without a cover...
 I didn't know if it was good or bad  at the time, but I was special.
 So I thought about it a lot.
 I'm just like this coverless grimoire.
 I couldn't be classified.
 Who am I? What is my purpose in life?
 I kept asking myself that over and over.
 And as I did, I gained  more and more recognition.
 And once I finally got here, I thought...
 The path that I've walked  makes me who I am.
 I am the Wizard King.
 I just figured it out.
 We are about to use the  power of the magic stones
 in an attempt to defy the  natural order of this world.
 This man...
 This human...
 He is an existence that the world and  fate created in order to stop us.
 The last bastion of order.
 As the Wizard King,
 I will protect this kingdom
 and its people.
 Then I suppose... No.
 This is exactly why I have to defeat him!
 In that case... just try to protect them now!
 Sealing Magic Released!
 His power is swelling...
 H-Hey...
 What is that?
 Wh-What's going on?
 This tremendous magic power is...
 You humans stole everything from me.
 My friends... my days of  happiness... all in an instant.
 Even if it means violating the natural order...
 You humans shall pay!
 To think he had enough magic power  to overwhelm this entire kingdom...
 This isn't good. Is he planning to  unleash that power upon the people?
 Even if I can't kill you alone,
 I can kill everyone else.
 I-Is this a spell?
 Countless swords of light?
 Mommy, the sky's all white!
 It's so bright!
 I-Is this the end of the world?
 What's going on?
 Town in the Common Realm: Nean
 It's so empyreal...
 A Village Out in the Boonies: Hage
 What the heck is that?
 We can see it from way out here?
 I have a bad feeling about this.
 Don't worry. Even if that  light is something ominous,
 this kingdom has Magic Knights.
 The size of that light spell  is ridiculous... damn it!
 What the hell's going on, Julius?
 Please let me make it in time!
 It's already enveloped the  whole kingdom. At this rate...
 Now... Accept your judgment, humans!
 Light Magic: Arrows of Judgment!
 I had doubts.
 Honestly, why do those commoners  have such poor magic?
 I honestly don't know how  peasants are even alive.
 It makes me sick just being  in the same kingdom as them.
 Indeed!
 Is that really the case?
 What are you looking at?
 Nothing.
 Despite having high levels of magic power,
 they only used it to line their own  pockets and weren't of any use to anyone.
 Why were they even alive?
 Ah, you must be the Magic  Knight I heard about.
 The one with the bizarre grimoire.
 Well, that aside, there's a merchant
 who has requested our  accommodation of his business.
 Oh, really?
 You see...
 Ah, well, well...
 I kept searching for my purpose in life  while fighting as a Magic Knight.
 And then...
 Hurry up and give me all your money!
 Hold it!
 You evil villain who threatens  the peace in this kingdom...
 I won't let you get away with this!
 I encountered a man named Zara,
 who was the first peasant to  be chosen as a Magic Knight.
 Come at me with all you've got!
 Just so you know, my magic is a hundred  times stronger than yours, you fat-ass!
 A Magic Knight, eh?
 Like that scares me!
 You fell for it.
 All right!
 Everyone, get someplace safe!
 Heya! Could you come down here a sec?
 He didn't have much magic power,
 but he cleverly used his trap spells in battle.
 Observation of his magic made  it clear how hard he worked.
 Hey, what the heck is that magic?
 It's almost like you're  reversing the flow of time.
 Close, but not quite.
 Time magic, eh? That's way too awesome.
 But I'd say there won't be any casualties now.
 Zara, was it? Looks like  you're quite hurt yourself.
 Let me have a look.
 I'm fine.
 As a Magic Knight,
 we need to prioritize the lives  of the people, after all!
 Don't you feel the same way, Julius?
 Well, I'll leave this to you.
 While other Magic Knights were blinded  by personal achievements and glory,
 he always prioritized helping out  the people above everything else.
 Back then, even though I didn't really  know what it meant to be a Magic Knight,
 I thought he was what a true  Magic Knight should be.
 A little while later...
 I heard that Zara had died.
 Whoa, there.
 Oh?
 You're...
 Zara had carried out his  duty as a Magic Knight.
 That's how I wanted to be...  a Magic Knight like Zara.
 And right around the time  I started thinking that...
 I heard that he was killed by  another member of his own squad.
 No way! He must've been  one hell of an annoyance
 if there are rumors like that going around.
 He probably showed off too much.
 Well, it doesn't matter.  This just means another peasant died.
 This cannot be okay.
 It wasn't just happening  with the Magic Knights.
 In this kingdom, because of  the class they were born into,
 the ones on top grew arrogant while  the ones at the bottom gave up.
 Even though both sides  should've had more potential.
 I thought it was a waste.
 The potential of magic  and of humans is infinite.
 For your voice to be widely  heard, you need power,
 rank,
 and trust.
 I built up a record of achievements  and became the Wizard King.
 Magic and humans should be freer.
 The change won't be dramatic.
 However, slowly but surely...
 The people of this kingdom are  finally starting to change.
 Through the strength of the people  I believe in and acknowledge...
 Through the strength of the  people they acknowledge.
 I can't let that end now.
 Not while I am the Wizard King!
 Time Reversal Magic: Chrono Anastasis.
 Wh-What's going on?
 A time spell tremendous enough to save  all the people of this kingdom...
 Impressive.
 But it appears that you've  used up all the time and magic
 that you had accumulated.
 I'm sure you saw my attack.
 But you couldn't cancel that time spell
 in order to evade.
 Because...
 you are the Wizard King.
 The fact that you are the Wizard King...
 That is your one and only weakness.
 What the hell's going on here...
 Vangeance?!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Please, Calm Down!
 Please, Calm Down!
 What's going on?
 Is Lord Julius fighting?
 What should we do?
 Please, calm down.
 Yes. Calm down.
 It's my job to remain  calm at times like this.
 There's no way Lord Julius should lose,
 but if all else fails, the only ones  who could keep up in this battle are
 Magic Knights Squad captains or their equals!
 I need to send a message to all the  Magic Knights Squad headquarters I've marked!
 Hello, you've reached the restaurant  Not Done Yet. You ordering takeout?
 I'm sorry, I've called the wrong number!
 This time, I'll get through to each of  the Magic Knights Squad headquarters!
 Hello, you've reached the hot  springs hot spot, My Hot Station.
 Do you want to make a reservation?
 Wrong number!
 I'll definitely get it this time!
 Who the heck are you?
 Um... Is this one of the  Magic Knights Squad headquarters?
 Say what?! I used to be—
 Damn it!
 What in the world is going on?!  I can't get through to them at all!
 Let's calm down a bit.
 Right...
 What the hell's going on here, Vangeance?!
 The crime of betraying Julius's trust  and my friendship deserves death!

94,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 While Asta and the other Royal Knights
 were attacking the hideout of  the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 back at the royal capital, the leader  of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht,
 had revealed himself before Julius
 and was fighting him for  possession of the magic stones.
 What is behind this man's strength?
 He's just an ordinary human. So why...
 Julius used a grimoire that had no cover  and his time magic, overpowering Licht.
 As the Wizard King,
 I will protect this kingdom
 and its people.
 But Licht then released his sealing magic and
 was about to attack every  citizen of the Clover Kingdom.
 The size of that light spell  is ridiculous... damn it!
 Now... Accept your judgment, humans!
 Light Magic: Arrows of Judgment!
 Time Reversal Magic: Chrono Anastasis.
 Julius used all of the time and magic  he had left in order to save the people.
 But that was exactly what Licht wanted.
 I'm sure you saw my attack.
 But you couldn't cancel that time spell
 in order to evade.
 Because...
 you are the Wizard King.
 What the hell's going on here...
 Vangeance?!
 New Future
 Good day to you, Yami Sukehiro.
 I am Licht.
 Licht...
 William is asleep inside me.
 No... I guess he was watching the Wizard King
 draw his last breath through this eye.
 Huh? What the hell are you talking about?
 I hope you're prepared.
 This can't be... This can't be happening...
 Lord Julius... No...
 What the hell are you doing, Marx?!
 We need to get him healed! Hurry up and  get Owen over here, you dumbass!
 Right away!
 Don't worry, Julius! We'll get you—
 It's no use.
 This man will die soon.
 You protected this country to the very end.
 You have my respect for that,  Wizard King Julius Novachrono.
 But...
 Master Licht!
 Dark Magic...
 Dark Cloaked...
 We will never, ever understand each other!
 Dimension Slash!
 I let him get away.
 Julius! Hang in there!
 Yami...
 That spell you just used was amazing...
 You actually cut through dimensions...
 Now's not the time for that.
 You've truly become an amazing Magic Knight...
 I keep telling you, I'm 28 now.
 I'm not a kid anymore.
 This is promising... The next  generation has grown up well,
 and the generation after  is starting to bloom...
 My wishes will live on with  the next Magic Knights...
 Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium Barrage!
 What's wrong, last of the Third Eye?  Is that all you've got?
 He doesn't stand a chance.
 I don't have any time to use  super speed or healing.
 Where's your next move? Are you done?
 She's defeating the Third Eye,  which gave us so much trouble, this easily?
 Captain Mereoleona is so freakin' cool!
 If this is all you've got,
 I'm just going to keep punching you  until there's nothing left.
 Well, shit.
 Burn to ashes!
 I'll acknowledge your strength, royal lady.
 And that's exactly why...
 Before I burn to ashes,  I'll self-destruct and take you with me!
 Land one more hit on me, and it's kaboom!
 The anti-magic kid... He must've  sensed the self-destruct spell
 and managed to get over here  even faster than that lady's attack.
 How freakin' fast can he  read his opponent and move?!
 I saw two others that tried  to self-destruct, too!
 I'm starting to catch on, you Third Eye jerk!
 Don't waste your life like that!
 What the heck is the deal with you people?!
 Going on about having something stolen  from you and getting revenge against humans!
 I still don't get it! But you're  humans just like us, aren't you?!
 First, you guys need to  clearly explain your deal!
 Then you can listen to what I've got to say!
 I won't allow you to die before that!
 For crying out loud... You sure are  a fiery little brat, aren't you?
 You've got some nerve, cutting into my fight.
 Would you like to burn to ashes, too?
 What?!
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun
 threw our country into chaos,
 and left us with many casualties.
 They have no intention of coming  to an understanding with us!
 Out of the way.
 We have to squash them here and now...
 Even if it means killing them!
 Huh? Why's that?
 We can understand each other.
 I mean, we're basically the same as them.
 They're mad because something  precious to them was hurt.
 I've been thinking about this for a while.
 We're fighting because we  can't forgive each other.
 So how can we get rid of that rage and hatred?
 I'm an idiot,
 so I couldn't figure it out,  no matter how hard I thought about it,
 but I'm sure we can!
 We have to get rid of that rage and hatred!
 What I strived to achieve...  The future I tried to create...
 I believe that it's not too far away...
 The royals and nobles...  Commoners and peasants...
 Even if they're not human...
 A kingdom without discrimination or hatred...
 A new future I'd create with all of you...
 A free kingdom
 where everyone can acknowledge  each other and smile...
 That's the kind of kingdom I want to create
 when I become the Wizard King.
 What a fool,
 blurting out something so overambitious  without any hesitation...
 He's actually serious about that.
 There used to be a guy who  said the same thing.
 This child is our future.
 It'll bridge the gap between elves and humans.
 Congratulations, Licht and Tetia!
 Congratulations!
 If all humans were like  you two, then maybe...
 But...
 There's no stopping this now.
 Welcome back!
 Took you long enough! You got the  last magic stones, didn't you?
 Watch your mouth.
 Everything went according to plan.
 No, even better! Master Licht  has slain the Wizard King!
 Whoa, are you serious?!
 Way to go, Master Licht!
 It's finally time.
 Now, no one can stop us.
 Julius... just hold on a little longer.
 Owen can fix up a wound like this in no time!
 The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 had the power to kill all  the people in our kingdom
 even without the help of the magic stones.
 He has another goal.
 Something terrifying might  happen to this kingdom...
 I'm sorry I let him steal the magic stones.
 I am unworthy of being Wizard King...
 The hell are you talking about?!  You saved this damn kingdom!
 Lord Julius... Let us make it in time.
 I'm sure Marx will be angry  that I let this happen...
 It's a pity that I can't be there when Fuegoleon wakes up...
 Yami... There's so much I still  wanted to talk to you about...
 You can't be serious! Who the  hell said you could leave?
 I'm not letting that happen! I still...
 I hear he's not from this kingdom.
 Apparently he's a castaway from some foreign  country who lives on the coast by himself.
 I wish he'd just leave the country.
 Wow! That's dark magic, isn't it?!
 That's amazing! I've never seen that before!
 Hey, hey, hey! Let me  get a better look at it!
 No. Who the heck are you, old man?
 Old...? Oh, but I'm not suspicious at all!
 I'm just a Magic Knights Captain who  was wandering around in disguise.
 What's a Magic Knight?
 Huh? You don't know?!
 Hmm...
 Well, why not come see for yourself?
 I'm sure you've got potential.
 This is how you write your  name in our kingdom.
 Seriously? I can't learn to write  wormy-looking letters like that.
 Oh, don't be like that! Let's practice!
 I don't wanna.
 Huh? Um, if you learn to write it,  I'll treat you to dinner.
 I'll do it.
 Huh?
 You've only just joined, but your  performance never fails to amaze me.
 Just make sure you don't go too crazy.
 We've been getting some complaints...
 Hey, the enemy's here. There's a swarm of them.
 Let's go, Yami.
 Just don't go too crazy.
 Yeah, he's definitely not listening.
 And starting today, you are the Captain of  the Magic Knights Squad, the Black Bulls.
 Congratulations, Yami.
 Yami...
 I leave the rest to you...
 You got it.
 I'm so happy that I got to see so  many different kinds of magic...
 I'm so happy that I got to meet so  many different kinds of people...
 Julius...
 We'll protect...
 this kingdom!
 I hope everyone is okay in there.
 It's been a few hours since I activated  this spatial jamming spell.
 It's becoming difficult to  stay in this position.
 But there's no time for complaining!
 Everyone is risking their lives  fighting the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 For the future of the Clover Kingdom.
 Please do your best in there.
 Look over there!
 That's...
 A tremendous amount of mana!
 That's the center of the hideout.
 Everyone, please be careful!
 I don't feel like I'd lose to anyone right now!
 Yeah, yeah! Go, go, Yuno!
 What is this?
 Is that... a person?
 This mana...
 I-It's so overwhelming...
 Once I set this final magic stone,
 the tree of life monument will become  the guide that will awaken our true power.
 Yes...
 This day has finally come, Master Licht.
 Now we, who have been chosen by the mana,
 will have a tremendous amount  of magic awaken in us, right?
 I'll show those Magic Knight bastards
 my true power the next time I see them!
 If we magnify our magic powers even  more with my dark magic items,
 we might be invincible!
 Then we can sweep up Asta, and I can  run all the experiments I want on him!
 Silence. The magic  we're about to acquire
 is to be used only for the creation  of a new kingdom by Master Licht.
 If we hadn't met Master Licht...
 Our very existence would've been disavowed
 and scorned, and we would've  continued living alone.
 But Master Licht welcomed us  into the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 All I want is to serve Master  Licht and be of some use to him.
 Damn! You're so annoying,  you goody two-shoes.
 But it sounds like we'll be able to raise hell
 even more now, so I guess I'll follow you.
 I'll help you out even  more with my experiments!
 Everyone, you've done amazing work so far.
 I thank you.
 I'm very proud of all of you.
 The time to make our long-cherished  dream come true is finally here.
 Let us be reborn in our true forms  and create our own country.
 Yes...
 What I've said up to this point
 has been the words of the Eye of  the Midnight Sun's leader, Licht.
 Huh?
 And from here on out,  I'll say what I really think.
 All of you are greedy and selfish.
 You have no qualms about harming others,
 although you're terribly  sensitive to your own pain.
 You envy, hate, and discriminate
 against other humans for  the most trivial reasons.
 You justify your own weaknesses  by thoroughly idolizing something.
 Everything... Every last thing is for  the sake of your own filthy selves!
 You humans truly are selfish, hopeless,  foolish, and ugly creatures.
 Master Licht?
 What the hell are you talking about?
 This is goodbye for all of you.
 You will serve as the foundation  of the resurrection.
 Huh? What's that light?
 What is that? It's coming from the boonies.
 What's...
 Looks like it's begun.
 Begun?
 His magic power suddenly skyrocketed...
 Hey, this isn't good.
 We're going to regain our true  forms... and our true power.
 Wh-What's going on?
 This terrifying magic power...  It doesn't belong to a human being!
 E-Everyone... We should all leave for—
 Yuno?
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Studying
 Studying.
 What does this say, Yami?
 I dunno.
 What about this?
 I dunno.
 Then...
 I'm telling you, I can't learn all this.
 Don't underestimate how terrible  I am at remembering things!
 Yami, you shouldn't set limits for yourself.
 You may think it's impossible right now,
 but as long as you believe,  you can surpass your limits.
 One day, I'm going to make this kingdom  a place where your magic, status,
 and where you were born don't matter.
 A place where we can all smile together.
 It might sound like a dream,  but I believe that it's possible.
 Surpass my limits...
 How do you write that?
 Feeling motivated now?
 Then here's your last question!
 What's this letter?
 Left.
 This isn't a vision test.
 We walked for many months and years
 consumed by sadness and loneliness.
 But now, that comes to an end.

 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.

 A four-leaf grimoire!
 Licht of sword magic was chosen  by a four-leaf grimoire!
 What's a four-leaf grimoire, Mommy?
 It's a grimoire with good fortune in it.
 Only those it chooses can wield it!
 Licht
 Licht, with the four-leaf grimoire...
 He's so cool!
 Licht!
 You again?
 You're so annoying,  coming by every day. Go away.
 Shoo, shoo.
 Patry
 I'm not here to see you.
 What did you just say, shrimp?
 Oh, come on. He's not annoying, Raia.
 I'm glad you came to see me.
 Oh, I see.
 So what do you think, Licht?
 Hm?
 About the rumors that the  humans might attack us.
 I believe they're just rumors.
 But I wouldn't say it's  completely impossible.
 They're...
 Humans are a wicked-hearted race that kills animals for sport.
 Their magical powers are weak,
 but their increased numbers  have made them overconfident.
 Even though we elves have saved them
 from countless natural disasters in the past...
 I'm sure they're just scared.
 Scared?
 They're just like us.
 We're much alike, but they don't  know that, so they fear us.
 But we should be able to  understand each other...
 because we both receive grimoires.
 That's...
 It's a tornado caused by  natural mana running wild.
 It's pretty big.
 It'll go away on its own if we ignore it.
 Licht!
 Someone else appeared  behind the tornado?
 That's...
 Sword Magic:
 Origin Flash!
 Light Magic:
 Lamp of Avior!
 Licht!
 He managed to destroy a tornado  that big! He really is amazing.
 But...
 Who's that guy who just used light magic that seemed
 just as powerful as Licht's magic?
 Are you all right?
 Y-Yes.
 Thank you so much.
 Tetia! Why did you leave the  castle without permission?
 Brother...
 Your magical attribute is wind.
 How did you, of all people,  get caught up in a mana tornado?
 Thank you for saving my little sister.
 It's nothing...
 He has a four-leaf grimoire,  just like Licht.
 A human...
 Licht sure has been hanging  around those two a lot lately.
 He sure has. I guess he's happy  to have some human friends.
 I mean, those two are really decent people,
 and they seem to have the  same thoughts as Licht.
 The same thoughts?
 They were wondering if elves  and humans could get along, too.
 I see.
 Why must Licht keep hanging  around those humans?
 But Licht is never wrong.
 And that human was also
 selected by one of the four-leaf  grimoires, just like Licht.
 We can come to understand each other.
 You elves have truly amazing mana.
 By combining that with the magic-item  technology that we humans created,
 we can make this land  safer and more prosperous.
 Let us live together, hand in hand.
 You're with child?
 With you two as its parents, I'm sure it'll be a wonderful child!
 Congrats, Tetia... and Licht, too, I guess.
 Well, thanks, I guess.
 What? Something bothering you?
 Well...
 I guess you are still a kid.
 Be quiet! Stop treating me like a child!
 Yeah, yeah... Ooh, aren't you scary?
 Oh, there they are.
 Hey there, Raia.
 Are you too lazy to even wake up nowadays?
 You're the worst.
 Oh, shut up.
 Jeez, Patry. Hogging the  spot next to Licht again?
 After tomorrow's ceremony,  he's going to belong to someone else,
 so you should probably cut the cord now.
 Shut up. I can do what I want.
 What, you little brat?!
 It's fine. Even if I marry Licht,  he still belongs to everyone.
 The human princess sure is nice.
 That kindness is going to  bring you trouble someday.
 And pretty soon, there won't be  any room for you anymore.
 Stop picking on him. Patry knows that.
 So, Licht, how does it feel, knowing you're  going to be a father in a few months?
 I can feel the mana blessing us.
 I'm very happy our child will come into  this world welcomed by everyone.
 This child is our future.
 It'll bridge the gap  between elves and humans.
 Congratulations!
 I wish you both years of happiness!
 May the mana bless you!
 Thank you so much.
 Please take care of my little sister for me.
 Yes. I will protect her, no matter what.
 Thank you for being here today, everyone.
 Congratulations!
 Tomorrow's the day you get your grimoire.
 Licht, you remembered!
 Of course. How could I forget?
 I'm excited to see which  grimoire chooses you.
 Yes!
 Aw... I hope someday I'll also...
 I'm sure you'll meet  someone lovely soon, Fana.
 I sure hope so.
 I wish you a lifetime of happiness.
 Thank you.
 If this guy ever cheats on you,  let me know right away.
 I'll make sure to kick his ass.
 Hey, come on now, Raia...
 I'm just kidding.
 Licht seems so happy.
 I mean, Licht always seemed happy.
 I'm a bit jealous she's the one  who made him happier, but...
 It's because of those two humans.
 We can come to understand each other.
 I wonder if we can come to understand  humans someday, just like he said.
 Licht seems to believe that, too.
 I guess it's possible... for elves  and humans to join hands someday.
 Wh-What's going on?!
 The humans are attacking!
 This way! Hurry!
 I can't use any magic!
 Our magic has been sealed!
 Get down!
 Run... quickly...
 You loathsome humans...
 This is light magic. That means...
 ...dare you...
 How dare you?!
 Mommy!
 Run!
 Hey, wake up! Open your eyes!
 This can't be happening!
 This has to be a dream!
 Hey, answer me!
 It hurts! It burns!
 How dare you, how dare you, how dare you,  how dare you, how dare you?!
 They put up a barrier! We can't go—
 How dare you... How dare you...
 It's all over!
 How dare you?! How dare you?!  How dare you?! How dare you?!
 How dare you?! How dare you?!
 I'll never...
 Licht...
 Lich...
 ...t...
 Where... am I?
 What in the world is going on?!
 Didn't I die?
 These aren't... my hands.
 Huh?! Licht?
 What's going on?  I somehow look like Licht!
 Did my soul somehow end up in Licht?
 No... The feeling of this mana...
 This body... It's human!
 A human that looks like Licht?
 That's right... I'm sure that I died.
 The thing that Licht activated  when our magic was sealed...
 It must've been forbidden magic!
 Meaning... a reincarnation spell.
 This is...
 I can tell... I can feel them.
 Raia's soul...
 The souls of all the elves from the village!
 Licht must have activated a reincarnation  spell in those last moments!
 In order to save us elves!
 But not everyone's been fully reborn.
 It's just me.
 Right... my grimoire.
 This grimoire chose the soul that  inhabits this body, so I can't use it.
 I don't know if I was chosen  or if this is sheer coincidence.
 But... I was the only one who was reborn.
 And in Licht's form!
 I'm the only one who can save them all!
 I'm the only one who can!
 I have...
 been chosen.
 I will become Licht.
 No matter what I have to do...
 I will bring back all the elves.
 And this time...
 The humans betrayed someone precious  to me. They betrayed all of us!
 This time...
 This time, we'll destroy the humans!
 Forbidden Magic: Evil Eye.
 I've added magic from the other  world to your soul and assisted
 your reincarnation in a human  with a similar wavelength.
 Gathering the magical power I needed  to use this spell was no small task.
 I'd appreciate it if you didn't  cause me any trouble, Raia.
 You're Pat—
 However, bringing you back  is Licht's—no, my mission.
 Isn't that right, Raia?
 It sure is, Licht.
 You guys...
 Raia...
 So you're finally awake. You overslept.
 All things considered, I wish  I could've slept a little longer.
 I was also able to resurrect these two.
 Vetto... You're a kind soul  who can talk to the animals.
 And yet, even now, you're being persecuted.
 Come live with us once more.
 You're not the one who should be in despair.
 It's the humans.
 Remember your true self.
 How unfortunate, my old friend.
 Nothing has changed.
 Humans still continue to harm other humans.
 I shall destroy you all,  as you seem to desire.
 But I need your body.
 I need you to live.
 Fana, not only do you look alike,  but you both share the same name.
 This cannot be a coincidence.
 You shouldn't have to meet the same  sad ending in this lifetime, too.
 Now... awaken.
 The only ones I can resurrect  right now are these three.
 For a complete rebirth... In order  to resurrect everyone else,
 I will require a phenomenal  amount of power and sacrifices.
 We'll gather the magic stones  that were once in our village,
 which have now been scattered.
 By using the humans, of course.
 Isn't that a wonderful idea?
 Yeah.
 Let's do this, Licht.
 We will get revenge against  those loathsome humans.
 I will give them endless despair!
 Humans, you shall serve as the foundation of the resurrection.
 Foundation of the resurrection?  What the hell are you talking about?!
 We're about to awaken to an insane  amount of magical power now!
 Don't tell me you actually tricked us?!
 What the...
 Th-This is...
 When I gave you your new names and  welcomed you as comrades, I marked you...
 as sacrifices for this forbidden spell.
 Forbidden spell?!
 You can't be serious!
 You just randomly gave me that name!  I've never used it!
 My name is Rades Spirito!
 Master... Licht...
 Were we not...
 your precious comrades?!
 Yes, you truly were precious.
 Then why...
 Because...
 You are sacrifices that will help  bring back my true comrades.
 You bastard!

 How y'all doin'?
 Let me dissect you guys while  you're still alive sometime, okay?
 Oh, of course, there won't be any anesthesia.
 Suddenly, Marx and Owen attack Yami.
 Despite all the confusion, Yami incapacitates them.

96,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Asta and the others who infiltrated  the Eye of the Midnight Sun's base
 continued to dominate the battle.
 Mereoleona tried to finish Raia off, but...
 We can understand each other.
 I mean, we're basically the same as them.
 They're mad because something  precious to them was hurt.
 A free kingdom
 where everyone can acknowledge  each other and smile...
 That's the kind of kingdom I want to create
 when I become the Wizard King.
 What a fool,
 blurting out something so overambitious  without any hesitation...
 He's actually serious about that.
 There used to be a guy who  said the same thing.
 If all humans were like you two, then maybe...
 But...
 There's no stopping this now.
 And around the same time, Licht...  no, Patry's true motive was revealed.
 Patry was once betrayed by the humans
 and witnessed the massacre of many of his elven friends.
 In order to bring back his friends,  he had been acting as Licht this entire time.
 The humans betrayed someone precious  to me. They betrayed all of us!
 This time...
 This time, we'll destroy the humans!
 Humans, you shall serve as the foundation of the resurrection.
 What the...
 This is...
 The Black Bulls Captain vs the Crimson Wild Rose
 I don't think I have the  profile just right yet.
 This is insane!
 We should have no problems  defeating these insects!
 Hey, so where's your boss?
 U-Uh...
 Come on, tell me. I'm dying to paint right now.
 Master Licht is...
 Huh, what? What, what, what?!
 I didn't even do anything yet!
 Wh-What in the world...
 What's going on?
 Wow, I wonder what's happening!
 A Village Out in the Boonies: Hage
 The demon's skull...
 D-Don't worry. It'll be okay, kids.
 There's nothing to worry about.
 Even if something dangerous  were to happen,
 the Clover Kingdom has the Magic Knights.
 Asta... Yuno...
 Town in the Common Realm: Nean
 It's nighttime, but it looks  like the sun's about to rise.
 Earlier, there were swords of  light coming from the sky.
 What in the world is  going on in this kingdom?
 What... is... that?
 Th-This seems different from  the swords of light earlier.
 That light is like the light of our friendship.
 But I guess this isn't the  time to talk about that.
 Is this another attack by  the Eye of the Midnight Sun?
 It disappeared... but our  friendship will never fade.
 U-Um, Gauche?!
 What?
 Um... Your body...
 What about it?
 It's... shining... really... bright.
 M-Marie?
 Things keep happening one after  another. What's going on?
 What the...
 What is this light?
 Luck?
 H-Huh? Huh, wait, what?!
 What the heck is going on with you now?!
 You just started shining outta nowhere!
 Once you're done with that, you better explain what's going on!
 Hey, are you listening?!
 Too bad...
 What is?
 The era of the humans has come to an end.
 Wh-What's the matter...
 E-Everyone?
 Yuno... Hamon... Klaus...
 Do not talk to us.
 You are not one of us.
 Begone...
 Begone...
 Begone...
 Begone...
 Begone...
 Begone, humans!
 Now, the time for revenge has come!
 That light just now... wasn't an attack.
 So what the hell was it?
 I feel strong magic throughout the kingdom.
 This ki... Don't tell me...
 Wh-What was that light?
 Are you all right? What happened?
 We must contact all the  Magic Knights in the area.
 Wait, what are you doing?!
 So you two finally showed up,
 but why the hell are you all  shiny and attacking our comrades?
 Marx! Old Man Owen!
 Sorry, but we aren't the  men you knew anymore.
 Long ago, we were destroyed by  the humans of this kingdom.
 We are elves.
 Elves?
 This time, we'll be destroying you.
 Just as you did to us, we will  destroy every last one of you.
 Well, this sounds like it's  going to be a pain in the ass.
 The guy did say that once they  collected all the magic stones,
 they'd be reborn into their true  forms and obtain enormous power.
 So the ones who were reborn aren't the  guys in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Don't worry. You'll be put out  of your misery soon enough.
 Marx's magic...
 If any of these hit me, I'll lose  my memory of what just happened.
 And now the jerk's speed  and range have skyrocketed.
 And Old Man Owen's healing  magic also skyrocketed,
 except now the healing's so powerful, it'll bust a hole in my ass.
 I'll be finished if either one of  them manages to hit me. Shit!
 I don't know who that corpse is, but is it precious to you?
 It doesn't matter who they are.  All humans are sinners and deserve to die.
 You bastard!
 If it's that precious to you,
 how about I rip it to shreds  right in front of you?
 Don't you dare make those two  say shit like that ever again.
 You're just going to be easier  to hit if you leap right at us!
 Memory Magic: Torment Canceller!
 Dark Magic: Black Hole.
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked...
 Lightless Blade Storm!
 What?
 This human's movements...
 Dark Cloaked Lightless Blunt Slash!
 You two can take a little nap.
 See, I swore to a man you both  respected that I'd protect this country.
 For crying out loud...
 These two don't even use battle magic,  and they were this much trouble?
 Red roses?
 My comrades...
 It appears you let your guard down,  considering you just woke up.
 Rest a while within my magic.
 Well, that's damn nice of you.  It's not like you, though, Spiny Prickly Queen.
 I don't know who you are, but you  seem quite skilled for a human.
 What's going on?
 There are powerful spells  going off everywhere!
 Is it another attack on the royal capital?
 Get the hell outta here, you dumbasses!
 If you guys don't survive,  I'll murder you!
 I can't do much about the  destruction to the town.
 As long as the citizens survive,  the kingdom won't die.
 But if more of these things  keep sprouting up everywhere,
 we might just get wiped out.
 The scent from the roses is  cloaking the Prickly Queen's magic.
 This isn't like her at all.
 But you see...
 I was always really badass  at playing hide-and-seek!
 Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!
 You have impressive instincts for a human.
 That wasn't instinct.  I distinctly felt your ki!
 Ki?!
 Three cheers for ki!
 The way she moves and her ki  are definitely Charlotte's,
 but her magic combat tactics are different.
 In addition to her normal  midrange attacks,
 she's using roses that scramble  magic with their scent
 and a variety of close-range attacks.
 On top of that, she's not  leaving any openings now.
 Knocking her out with the blunt edge of  my sword will be nearly impossible.
 I heard her roses turned blue when  she got hit with that curse as a kid.
 The curse!
 The curse upon the House  of Roselei has activated!
 Damn it!
 What the hell's the big idea, you jerk?
 You flung the pasta soup  I was eating everywhere.
 On missions, you're as cool as a cucumber  and always raring to go. So what gives?
 I like tough girls.
 But it probably wouldn't hurt to ask someone for help once in a while.
 Our Magic Knights Squads are full  of strong people you can rely on.
 I don't really get it, but apparently  the curse was broken back then.
 Yet, because of the curse, her roses remained blue.
 But an elf's in there right now.
 Did turning into something that's not  human kill off the lingering effects, too?
 So this is what Charlotte Roselei's  briar magic was supposed to be!
 You used the power of the curse
 to make yourself stronger  through sheer grit...
 And now some other woman's  using your magic perfectly.
 That's pretty lame, Prickly Queen!
 S-Sis!
 You're...
 Sis!
 B-Back there...
 When you attacked us...
 That was...
 That was some kind of mistake, right?
 Sis!
 Stop acting so familiar with me, human.
 I only have a younger brother.  I have no younger sisters.
 Sis...
 She's basically being controlled by  some kind of spell. Don't worry about it.
 You're the Black Bulls' captain...
 I'll deal with her.
 Huh?
 But you showed up at a good time.
 Hey, what is this?
 Take this and get to someplace safe.
 I-I don't take any requests from men!
 Damn it, now's not the time for that!
 But...
 There's a hero in there.  Be extra careful with it.
 Hey!
 I can't leave my sis with any guy!
 Hey, you dumbass! Come back here!
 How can I leave my sis and run off?
 I'll bring Sis back to her senses!
 Earth Magic: Divided—
 Sis's magic is really dense here.  It's preventing me from using my magic well.
 The Black Bulls' captain was  doing all that in here?!
 I can't even fight properly?
 No!
 I'm only alive now...
 because Sis saved me!
 I'll wake Sis up, even if it kills me!
 Quit screwing around!
 Our mission right now is  to protect and to survive!
 I understand how you feel.
 Then—
 But you need to survive for  her sake, too, you dumbass!
 I won't let anyone near  my Sis! Especially men!
 Please take care of Sis.
 Save the Blue Rose Knights' captain!
 Leave it to me! Now get outta here.
 You cannot run now.
 Who said I was gonna run?
 Dark Magic: Black Hole!
 Your subordinate is crying, you know.
 Why the hell are you letting  them control you like this?
 You're not that weak,
 Charlotte!
 You have my respect. You are strong.
 That magic sure is insane.  My Black Hole can't absorb all that.
 If she fires that off cleanly,
 it'll blow away half this town, and we'll  be dealing with a bunch of dead people.
 Tch! You've always had my respect.
 So... I'll use everything I've  got to take you back alive!
 Dark Magic...
 Briar Magic...
 Crimson Vine Spear!
 Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!
 Luck? Ben?
 Golden magic... How beautiful.
 Such menacing magic...
 It's the same as Vetto and the others.
 Why is that magic coming from you two?

 Yami was attacked by Marx and Owen,  who had been reincarnated as elves.
 Memory Magic: Torment Canceller!
 Dark Cloaked Lightless Blunt Slash!
 He managed to incapacitate  them both, but...
 Red roses?
 Charlotte Roselei, who had also  been reincarnated as an elf,

 Okay...
 That should take care of that.
 The Black Bulls' captain seemed  pretty protective of it.
 I wonder what's inside.
 Dark Magic...
 Briar Magic...
 Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!
 Crimson Vine Spear!
 Sis!
 Our attacks just now...
 My magical power definitely  overpowered his.
 And yet his spell managed  to cut through mine,
 softening the blow,  which protected the town.
 Though it only damaged my arm  guard, he managed to reach me.
 Regardless of whose magic was stronger,  he turned the tide of the battle.
 So there are humans who have managed  to master skills such as that one?
 If that were not the case, those two  wouldn't have been defeated, either.
 It appears as though we've  underestimated the humans.
 I used more magic than I intended.  I should retreat for now.
 I'll wait for Licht and the others to arrive
 and take every precaution  necessary before proceeding.
 Sis!
 What happened to the Black Bulls' captain?
 D-Don't tell me that Sis defeated  the Black Bulls' captain...
 Come back here, you jackass!  You didn't finish me off yet, you bitch!
 Watch what you're doing!  I thought I was gonna die!
 Where the hell'd she go?!
 He's alive. I mean, I'm glad he's alive, but...
 I'm gonna slap you back to your senses,
 Spiny Prickly Queen,  a.k.a. Prickly Queen for short!
 Hey, rowdy girl!
 Rowdy girl?
 What are you doing back here?  Where's the thing I gave you?
 I hid it somewhere safe.
 You'd better have!  I'm trusting you, you jerk!
 A-And you'd better take care of my sis!
 Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
 Right now, I can't save Sis.
 I'm trusting you!
 Yeah, you do that.
 So what are you going to do?
 I'm trying to figure that out right now.
 Actually...
 Rowdy girl! You go save the citizens!
 I'm sure there are other Magic Knights around,  so save all the people you can!
 Yes, sir!
 And as for me...
 What has happened?
 What is this overwhelming magical  power I feel coming from outside?
 And the commotion was great enough to  break open this magically sealed prison.
 Former Captain of the Purple Orcas Gueldre Poizot
 Whatever this may be,  it's the chance of a lifetime!
 I'm going to use this chance to escape.
 Well, well, look who it is.
 If it isn't the former captain of  the Purple Orcas, the great Gueldre.
 Well, well... I never thought  I'd see your face again,
 Revchi of Chain Magic.
 Revchi Salik
 I do beg your pardon, but I'm in quite a hurry. We'll have to catch up some other time.
 That may be convenient for you,  but it's definitely not for me.
 Because two years ago, you did this  number to my face during a mission,
 blamed the mission going wrong on me,
 then kicked me out of the Purple Orcas!
 You brought that upon yourself.
 Everyone in the squad hated you.
 Not a single person took your side.
 I believe that goes for you, too.
 Isn't that why the great former  captain of the Purple Orcas
 was trapped down here?
 This has nothing to do with a pathetic loser who avoided dangerous missions
 out of fear for his life, who never aimed for the top,
 and who kept getting outdone by his juniors.
 Pretty pathetic for Mister Transparency Magic,  who's immune to all attacks.
 Your chain magic was able to  seal any mage's magical power,
 so my heart bleeds for you.
 That's right! I'm invincible!
 If it hadn't been for that ridiculous  brat and his anti-magic...
 Hm?
 You, too?
 The same thing happened to you?
 I don't even need my chains  to touch him. I can tell.
 His magical power is off the charts!
 Humans located.
 There are guys like him wreaking havoc outside?
 So the commotion outside is  the Eye of the Midnight Sun?
 Looks like I might've  aided some real monsters.
 All humans are to be killed on sight.
 Wait! I'm not your enemy!
 Depending on the circumstances,  I don't mind helping you out!
 Let me speak with your leader.
 We will never be tricked  by you humans ever again.
 It doesn't matter who you are.  All humans shall be slain.
 It appears we have no choice  here, Mister Revchi.
 This sucks, but you're right, Gueldre.
 Transparency Magic: Invincible Seeker  plus Invisible Traveling Companion.
 They disappeared?
 Impossible... Even their  magic disappeared?
 In that case, I'll just have  to destroy this whole area!
 Chain Creation Magic:  Magic-Binding Iron Chain Formation!
 My magic has been sealed?
 But my magical powers were  far superior to theirs.
 What in the world is their magic?
 You can pose no problem once we've caught you.
 Is this my ticket out of obscurity?
 Yes... My legend won't end here.
 Come, let us retake our greatness,  Mister Revchi.
 Indeed, Gueldre.
 Luck? Ben?
 Such menacing magic...
 It's the same as Vetto and the others.
 Why is that magic coming from you two?
 Why is that magic coming from you two?
 Noelle's right. What's mixed in  with their magic seems to be...
 the same as the one from  the House of Vaude.
 A tremendously menacing magic...
 It appears we've made it back.
 Let me do this.
 You sure have a lot of energy,  for one who just awakened.
 It's because I just awakened. I have more  energy than I know what to do with.
 This is in the way.
 W-Wait, Luck. What are you talking about?
 I'm sure they won't amount to much as opponents,
 since they're human.
 Whoopsie. It's been so long, I missed.
 Let's try that again.
 Cherry Blossom Magic:  Magic Cherry Blossom Storm of Petals.
 I'm not sure what happened,
 but it appears those two  aren't who they used to be.
 Beautifully prepare for combat, Noelle!
 B-But Luck is one of the Black Bulls...  He's my friend...
 Noelle!
 Aw, I can't see.
 I won't be able to aim like this.
 Then I'll have to...
 get up close and personal.
 His magic is swelling...
 He's coming! Defend!
 Luck... Why? Why?!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
 Were they brainwashed? No, the very  nature of their magic has changed!
 Luck's magical power is on a completely  different level than usual!
 That feel of your magic a  second ago... Are you royals?
 What if I were to tell you that my  beautiful self is indeed royalty?
 That just gives me even  more reason to kill you.
 Come on, you can't be serious.
 This guy was already a monster,  and now he's even worse.
 Maybe it's because I'm a liar myself,
 but I've always been able to  tell when someone is lying.
 Anti-magic shrimp...
 What you said earlier...
 A free kingdom
 where everyone can acknowledge  each other and smile...
 That's the kind of kingdom I want to create
 when I become the Wizard King.
 You were actually serious about that.
 I hate to admit it,  but it moved my heart a bit.
 The same thing happened back then...
 We can come to understand each other.
 He wasn't lying, either.
 That's why I believed him.
 But because I believed him, that happened.
 That's why I'll never trust them again.
 I'm going to kill you so I can  get over any hesitation.
 Copy Light Magic:  Light Swords of Conviction!
 Copy Dark Magic: Lightless Slash!
 He's casting spells with different  attributes at the same time?!
 Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium Barrage!
 Do you see now, you fool?
 No matter how much you want to understand,
 that's not an option for them!
 They're trying to kill us based  on feelings they can't negotiate.
 In that case, I'm going to win
 and create a path to  understanding each other!
 That path has long been closed.
 Then I'll just open it up again!
 Very well, you fool.
 You should probably hurry up, though.
 Otherwise, I'm going to defeat him.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Calidos Brachium!
 That spell of hers is a trap  and hold move that I won't
 be able to break free from if she hits me.
 Which means...
 I'm not letting you hit me again!
 A combination of spatial  and light magic...
 He's using light magic to speed up even faster.
 When you can use it with something else,  Li'l Val's magic is awesome.
 Though I'm pretty sure he's dead by now.
 Copy Spatial Magic: Myriad Black!
 Copy Light Magic: Sky-Rending Flash!
 Seriously, how the hell are  we supposed to deal with him?
 Oh?
 Rill...?
 Oh, hey, it's Raia. Heya, how've you been?
 Hey, Lira. I see you're as crazy as ever.
 And I see that your face  is as droll as ever, Raia.
 Shut it.
 Raia, Raia, Raia!
 Stop it! You're so annoying!
 I'm so happy to see you!
 Come on!
 Hey! What are you doing, Rill?!
 My magic has a stylish name now!  It's called picture magic.
 Oh?
 He's a blockhead who's determined to kill us!
 What's his problem? He's so loud.
 We're in the middle of fighting him right  now! When'd you get all buddy-buddy?!
 Who are you?
 Huh? Wha... Rill?
 Rill? My name is Lira.
 Huh?! What are you talking about?
 The Captain of the Aqua Deer...
 That huge mana of his is even bigger,  and now he feels like that copy bastard.
 The way that space-gouging guy, the Golden Dawn's vice captain, felt...
 Was that a sign that this was coming?
 An enemy spell... Was it that light?
 From the feel of their magic,  this isn't a form of brainwashing.
 He apparently doesn't  recognize the brat, either.
 Does that mean someone  different is inside?
 I'm a fellow Magic Knight  and your friend, Asta!
 I'm not gonna let you say that you  forgot someone this loud, you jerk!
 Jeez, you're so persistent and loud.
 I don't have any human friends.
 I'll just have to shut you up with my  Picture Magic: Four-Headed Lindworm.
 He's basically being controlled  by the enemy's magic.
 Go smack him with your anti-magic!
 G-Got it!
 Sorry, but your magic won't  be able to reach us anymore!
 Oh, I don't know about that.
 It's not like I was just watching two  monsters duke it out this whole time.
 Ash Trap Spell: Total Activation!
 Ah, so you secretly planted some trap magic.
 But paralysis on this level  does next to nothing to us.
 Whoa, I can't see!
 But our mana detection is on point,  so we're perfectly fine!
 Too bad, because what's heading your way
 is a monster with no magic.
 He's circulating anti-magic  throughout his body?
 Wake up, Rill!
 I only grazed him!
 But I did hit him. That should break the spe—
 Jeez, that hurt. What'd you do that for?
 He's still not normal?
 Tch. Guess anti-magic didn't work, either.
 This isn't a simple little spell.
 It's a reincarnation spell that brings the  souls of elves to dwell in human bodies.
 A reincarnation spell?
 The spell that summons the souls is complete.
 These bodies belong to us now.
 Reincarnation? Elves?
 You can't be serious! Change Rill back to nor—
 Them, too?
 This is some kind of joke, right?
 All these bastards' magical  power is off the charts now.
 How are we supposed to win against them?
 Hey, we're retreating.
 Wh-What are you talking about?!
 We can't just leave everyone!
 Not yet! We can't leave yet!
 You dumbass.
 There's no way to save them right now,  so we're retreating to figure that out!
 You stupid little shit.
 I guess you're right,  you cool masked jerk!
 Besides, we both know that you can't  kill them. They're your comrades.
 Neither can you.
 Anyway, do you really think  you can get away from us?
 Okay, kiddos.
 You can head home first,
 you fools.
 Captain Mereo—
 What?
 You're going to stay behind and try to  stall all of us so those two can escape?
 Well, aren't you nice to  your friends, Miss Royalty?
 You seem to have the wrong idea.
 Those kiddos would've just been in my way.

 My air magic's mana has  basically filled this place up.
 You've barely been able  to use your magic at all.
 Usually, he'd add air to my flame magic, making it burn even brighter.
 To think he'd be this  terrifying as an opponent...
 I will not lose!
 I will defeat you and  return you to your senses!
 Concentrate...
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 Well, look at you. You were  able to use magic after all.
 But too bad...
 Air Magic: Air Blockade!
 I can wave my hand and put out  that puny little flame in no time.
 Air Magic: Crushing Air Blast!
 Leo!
 Give it up already. You'll be in less  pain if you just give up and die.
 I will not lose.
 The flames of the proud Crimson  Lion Kings cannot be extinguished!
 Leo's right!
 All remaining Senior Magic Knights who  can still fight will attack him at once!
 We will bring the vice  captain back to his senses!
 Yeah!
 Iron Creation Magic: Iron Bullet!
 Flame Magic: Burst Javelin!
 Stone Magic: Solid Rock!
 Show him the pride of the Crimson Lion Kings!
 You humans sure are intense.
 It doesn't matter how many of you come at me.
 You're not getting away!
 Guess it's my turn now.
 Air Magic: Explosive Air Wave Palm!
 Forti!
 He's fast!
 He kicks at the air to launch  himself in any direction,
 then he attacks with a blast  of air that we can't see!
 Vice Captain Randall's Air Magic...
 We don't stand a chance against it!
 Air Magic: Crushing Air Blast!
 All those Senior Magic Knights  don't even stand a chance!
 If only Lord Fuegoleon...
 Don't say that!
 This is our moment to prove our true worth!
 We're going to protect him, no matter what.
 Endure! If we endure this,  we'll have our chance to counter!
 No, you won't.
 The strongest squad? Don't make me laugh.
 Take this!
 What?
 Did you actually think I'd be surprised?
 I wondered why you were being quiet.  So you were waiting for an opening.
 It's time for your nap now.
 Air Magic: Crushing Air Blast!
 Don't rely on your eyes. Feel it.
 He dodged it!
 Oh?
 The only way to battle against
 the invisible air magic within this  mana-filled space is to read the mana.
 It's not as if I was just  sitting idly by, watching.
 I'm able to feel it more and more.
 I've found an ideal way to use my flames.
 Don't start celebrating  just because you got lucky.
 Air Magic: Explosive Air Wave Palm!
 You were willing to lessen  the blow by making it a draw.
 And then, as I was stepping back,  you attacked again with flames.
 Guess it wasn't luck after all.
 Well done, royal.
 You're all so intuitive,  and you adapt at a terrifying rate.
 Precisely!
 Leo, you're going to lead this squad one day.
 We'll buy you some time.
 Take everyone who can't  fight right now and survive!
 Guys! I can still fight alongside you!
 Leo!
 Go!
 We're entrusting the squad to you!
 We are the proud Crimson Lion Kings!
 We will boldly fall for the future  of this squad and this kingdom!
 Yeah!
 No!
 You can't do that. We're all  going to make it through this!
 I feel like I'm almost onto something.
 M-My body...
 Leo!
 You awakened a little too late.
 Fighting in a manner you're not  used to drains you instantly.
 You won't be able to stand any longer.
 So you're going to lead  this squad one day, eh?
 Sorry, but I'm going to make  sure that never happens.
 Damn it... Damn it!
 Move, body!
 Leo!
 Humans... and royals, especially...
 shall die violent deaths.
 I will not... give up!
 I swore an oath...
 I will not...
 Not here...
 Move... Move!
 What is this strange mana?
 This is...
 Another enemy?
 No... This warm, embracing flame mana...
 You fought well, Leo.
 Brother!
 But the battle's not over yet.  I'll take over from here.
 This mana is what I felt a moment ago...
 Salamander...
 As the captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
 and as your older brother,
 I will never lose... again!
 Where am I?
 I can feel it... their fiery  mana as they're in battle.
 I must go. As a Magic Knight...
 As the captain of the Crimson Lion Kings.
 Is this all you have?
 Is this the limit of your powers,
 Fuegoleon Vermillion?!
 It can't be. The Fire Spirit... Salamander?
 None shall...
 stand in my way.
 Even if I lose an arm, or my  flesh is burned by flames...
 As long as there are people waiting for me,
 I shall go to them, for I  am Fuegoleon Vermillion,
 the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings!
 I can feel it...
 Its mana and life force are flowing into me.
 There is something I must do!
 That's what you're telling me, isn't it?
 I will be using this power to its  full extent, my spirit friend.
 I apologize for worrying you, Leo.
 Please don't apologize!
 I knew you'd wake up, Brother!
 The rest of you fought well, too.
 Despite my deep sleep, I was  able to feel your fiery mana.
 Lord Fuegoleon!
 So this is the fire spirit, Salamander.
 According to Asta, it was accompanying
 one of the members of the upper echelon  of the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 but then it disappeared after the last battle.
 Forever faithful and highly  trusted by the people,
 the eldest brother of the royal  Vermillion siblings and a great Magic Knight...
 It's no wonder Salamander chose my brother!
 A mere human earned the blessing of a spirit?
 Not only that! Why did it  have to be a filthy royal?
 Randall!
 I've just woken up, so I may  not be able to hold back.
 Try not to die.
 You sure talk big.
 You may have been chosen by a spirit,  but you're still just a human.
 There's no way you stand  a chance against us elves!
 Brother!
 Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath!
 The flames are so strong  that I can't blow them away!
 I can't breathe because of  the heat. The air is...
 It's all being swept away!
 C-Curse you, royals!
 Flame Binding Magic: Leo Palma!
 You may be inhabiting the  body of my vice captain,
 but I will not allow any more violence.
 Lord Fuegoleon!
 You are truly the ultimate Magic Knight!
 Hurry! Treat the wounded at once!
 Yes, sir!
 He's too amazing.
 Way to go, Brother!
 But I'm still going to surpass you someday!
 As the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
 I swear I will bring you  back to your senses.
 Er, however, while you were asleep,
 our sister took your spot as captain for now.
 What?!
 Is that true?
 Y-Yes...
 You are currently former  Captain Fuegoleon.
 So my sister... That's how it  should've been to begin with,
 but she didn't even bother joining the  Magic Knights because it was a hassle.
 It appears I've made you do  something out of character.
 Salamander is showing me
 all of the mana from those who are  not human in the royal capital.
 It appears as though the situation has  escalated quite a bit while I was asleep.
 The day the royal capital  was attacked, I learned
 that the enemy was after me and decided  to go along with their scheme.
 What is this place?
 You're...
 This mana... Is that you, William?
 What are you doing here?
 I know you too well.
 I was hoping you wouldn't come  here knowing it was a trap...
 I truly hoped you wouldn't.
 What are you...
 Answer my question, William!
 You'll know the answer soon enough...
 You're...
 This is a secret that even the man
 who gave me my mask,  the Wizard King, doesn't know.
 ...once you've seen the other me.
 Who are you?!
 What did you do with William?!
 Ah, the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings.
 Though you're always calm,  this seems to have startled even you.
 That moment is all I need.
 Back then, he should've  been able to finish me off.
 I was also concerned about William  when he revealed himself to me.
 I will keep this concealed within my  heart until I find out the truth.
 I will not allow any more violence  to befall the Clover Kingdom!
 We are the Crimson Lion Kings!
 With the proud flames  that reside in our hearts,
 we will stop them, no matter what!
 Yeah!
 The true battle is about to begin.
 Member of the Golden Dawn David Swallow
 Why the heck are we dressed  like that one human royal was?
 Member of the Golden Dawn Letoile Becquerel
 Oh, I see. Our comrade who summoned  us here must be rather twisted.
 What do you mean by that?
 They're telling us to kill those humans.
 Ah, I see.
 It does piss me off that  they killed all of us
 and got to live such rich, fulfilling lives.
 So you're here, too.
 Well, well, it looks like you're all here.
 I was imprisoned in a peculiar place  when I woke up, so I had a little fun.
 Those foolish humans...
 Who do they think they are?  They piss me off so much.
 I'm guessing it was your cousin  who gathered us all here, Latry.
 Ah, so it was Patry.
 I guess that's why we get along  so well. We're both twisted.
 I can't wait to kill all these royals myself.
 The white night is over.
 Let us show the humans the golden dawn!
 Brother...
 Brother...
 Langris!
 Thank goodness!  You've returned to your senses!
 Wait! Hey!
 Don't go, Langris!
 Langris!
 Ow!
 Wh-Wh-What the... Wait, where am I?!
 It's been a while! I'm Finral!
 How long do you plan on sleeping,  you dumb bastard?
 Y-Yami?!
 As you can see, the royal capital's in trouble.
 You feel it, too, don't you?
 The inhuman magic that was coming from  your brother is now coming from all over.
 Let's go, Yami.
 Langris... This time, I'm going to save you!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Just Woke Up
 Just Woke Up.
 Lord Fuegoleon!
 You're finally awake!
 There is something I must do!
 Yes, sir!
 What?!
 A man who will not allow a single tangle  to remain! That is Fuegoleon Vermillion.
 Um... I think your bedhead is okay now.
 In that case, there is something I must do!
 Yes, sir!
 What?!
 A man who will make sure every  last tooth is as white as can be!
 That is Fuegoleon Vermillion.
 Um... I think you've brushed them enough.
 In that case, there is something I must do!
 Just five more minutes.
 What?!
 A charming man who always goes back  to sleep! That is Fuegoleon Vermillio—
 I will not allow any more blasphemy  against me for the sake of jokes!
 I am the Captain of the Crimson  Lion Kings, Fuegoleon Vermillion!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Royal Capital was thrown  into chaos by the attack of
 the Magic Knights who had  reincarnated into elves.
 Leopold and the other Crimson Lion Kings  faced a life-or-death situation
 after being attacked by  their vice captain, Randall.
 And then...
 None shall...
 stand in my way.
 Even if I lose an arm, or my  flesh is burned by flames...
 As long as there are people waiting for me,
 I shall go to them, for I  am Fuegoleon Vermillion,
 the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings!
 You fought well, Leo.
 Brother!
 As the Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings,
 and as your older brother,
 I will never lose... again!
 Fuegoleon had finally awakened, and with  the fire spirit, Salamander, at his side!
 And around the same time, back at the  Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout...
 You can head home first,
 you fools.
 Captain Mereo—
 Mereoleona Vermillion tried to  fight Raia and the others herself.
 The Desperate Path Toward Survival
 What?
 You're going to stay behind and try to  stall all of us so those two can escape?
 Well, aren't you nice to  your friends, Miss Royalty?
 You seem to have the wrong idea.
 Those kiddos would've just been in my way.
 Stall you? Don't make me laugh.
 I intend to kill all of you!
 Kill all of us?
 You're the one making me laugh.
 There's no way someone like you can't  see what you're up against right now.
 Sorry, but we're going to go after  that anti-magic kid really soon,
 because that grimoire and those  swords belong to the real Licht.
 I don't really care about this  ""real Licht"" or whatever,
 but you can shut up now.
 Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium...
 Barrage!
 If you're going to go after that fool,  do it after you defeat me.
 Five against one...
 You still need more of a handicap?
 There's no way even Captain Mereoleona  can fight all of them alone!
 We have to go back and help her!
 You dumbass. We're getting outta here.
 Huh?! What the hell are you  talking about, you jerk?!
 At this rate, Captain Mereoleona—
 It's not like we have a strategy,  so we'll just get killed if we go back.
 You might not have felt
 how powerful they were, since you don't have any magic.
 Believe me, I don't want a  damn royal saving my ass.
 But this is the best way for  at least some of us to survive.
 Don't you dare go wasting
 the captain's resolve like that, you little shit.
 Wing Magic: Angel Wing Gift!
 You think you can defeat all of us?
 Humans sure have gotten  cocky while we were asleep.
 I thought I told all of you to shut up.
 Then let's just get this over with.
 Unlike you selfish humans, we elves are connected by strong bonds.
 Your attacks won't even touch us.
 Wing Magic: Angel Flapping!
 Calidos Brachium!
 Tch. That's too many for me.
 Picture Magic: Subterranean Giant's Iron Arm.
 I think you might have a hard time burning  something this big. Don't you agree?
 Here you go!
 Tch...
 It managed to graze me. My senses are shot.
 My attacks seem to be losing their edge, too.
 What's...
 Snow Magic: Phantom Snow Box Garden.
 I'm forcibly putting the senses of  everyone in this space to sleep.
 Of course, I mean everyone  other than us elves.
 You crafty little brat.
 You're rather skilled at using mana,  even though you're human.
 But it's only a matter of time  before you won't be able to move.
 You've got some nerve to be attacking me,
 Ruben!
 My name is Rossa, not Ruben!
 Also...
 I don't know anyone as violent as you!
 Is that so?
 Then I guess I don't need to hold back!
 Sandstone Magic: Variable Hardness Prison!
 Take your last breath in there.
 The end.
 Looks like it's happily ever after.
 Don't tell me...
 Since you were a member  of the Crimson Lion Kings,
 I'll do you a favor
 and kill you with my own flames!
 What is this feeling? It's like my body knows  this woman and is frightened of her...
 I'll never let you kill my friends ever again!
 Well, see ya, Miss Royalty.
 Raia!
 What's wrong?
 You're going to kill all  the humans, aren't you?
 But I'm still alive.
 Is this woman actually human?
 Hurry up and... try to kill me!
 You sure are a pain in the ass!
 I'm...
 still...
 alive.
 Yeah, I'm at a loss for words.
 To think you can still stand  back up after all those attacks...
 I'll stand back up as many times as it takes...
 Until I've killed all of you!
 But I think it's about time we end this.
 Yeah...
 You'll all be finished... after  I use my most powerful spell.
 Mana Zone...
 Full Release!
 She still had this much magic?!
 What is this stinging feeling?
 My snow magic is being erased.
 Flame Magic...
 Calidos Brachium Purgatory!
 Owie, that hurt!
 I used up quite a bit of mana on defense.
 That human is insane.
 My word, that human sure  did a number on us.
 She was an unbelievable  woman to the very end.
 She passed out on her feet.  She really didn't want to go down, huh?
 Hey...
 Whoa, she's alive!
 I can't believe it! Is she really human?
 Hurry up... and come at me.
 She can't even move after using  up all her magic, and yet...
 Damn, you're scary.
 We need to kill her right here and now.
 I'm all for that.
 Let's send her out with a bang.
 Copy Light Magic...
 Snow Magic...
 Wing Magic...

 Captain Mereoleona!
 Sheesh...
 You fools...
 You really are idiots.
 You just wasted all the  time this lady bought you.
 Compound Magic: Elemental Quintet!
 You can all die together!
 But this is the best way for  at least some of us to survive.
 Don't you dare go wasting
 the captain's resolve like that, you little shit.
 Who gave her permission to  sacrifice herself like that?!
 And I've just decided that all three of  us are going to survive this together!
 Give it a rest, you little shit.
 Even in your black anti-magic form,  you can't shake all five of those monsters.
 Yeah, that's right! Besides,  that form is drawn to huge magic,
 so it's not great at running away!
 Well, if you know all that,  don't brag about it!
 What the hell are you gonna do?
 What am I gonna do?
 Oh, I know! Your magic!
 The thing where you double  the magic and bounce it back!
 Wha?
 All five of them will launch  spells at the same time.
 That's when we'll bounce  their spells back at them!
 All five of them attack at once?
 Like anything that convenient  will ever happen, you moron.
 Well, look at that. It actually happened.
 This is all thanks to the captain  managing to weaken them.
 He's ignoring the force of those spells?
 I'll use my counter trap to double it...
 But just doubling it won't  be enough to throw them off!
 Then I'll fling it back!
 He shot it at the brat?
 Then, after we double it,  we'll double it again!
 We'll quadruple it!
 Damn it... How dare you  find us a chance like this?
 I'm not taking responsibility  for the consequences!
 Shit! I knew I threw the circle together  too fast, and now it's falling apart.
 I won't be able to—
 Heads... up!
 Okay, let's get the heck outta here!
 We made it out!
 See? I told you we could save  her if we worked together!
 We just got lucky because we managed  to get one coincidence after another.
 Deflate that giant head of yours, you moron.
 You're definitely going to get hurt someday.
 And when that happens, I hope  you'll help me if you can!
 Man, my head hurts.
 Hang on, now...
 I'm not letting you get away.
 I'm gonna have you come with me to see Licht.
 You're going to return that grimoire  and those swords to Licht.
 I won't make it in time.
 Zora!
 Take care of Captain Mereoleona!
 Hey!
 I promise I'll make it back alive!
 So head on back first!
 You can't be serious!
 What did you just say earlier?
 Weren't the three of us  gonna survive this together?
 I'll make sure you regret it if you  don't make it back, you hear me?!
 You little shit!
 What's wrong, everyone?
 Klaus? Hamon?
 Yuno?
 Are you referring to us?
 Klaus?
 Do not speak to us.
 You are not one of us.
 What are you—
 She seems to be royalty.
 Indeed, she does.
 We will never forgive you humans!
 I need to concentrate on defense for now.
 Plant Recovery Magic:  Princess Healing Flower Robe!
 It's no use.
 You don't have any time to rest, royal.
 You accursed royal...
 That's a fitting look for you.
 They're not their usual selves.
 Both their magic and their  personalities are totally different.
 Even Yuno!
 It appears he doesn't have  a clear sense of self yet.
 Indeed. I'm sure he'll figure  that out as some time passes.
 Stop squirming! Ugh, you're such a pain!
 Asta?
 Mimosa?!
 Asta...
 You okay?! Who the heck did this to you?
 Hang on! I'll get you down!
 Hold it.
 I will not allow you to free that  descendant of criminals.
 Klaus and... the chubby  guy from the Golden Dawn?
 You can't be serious... Not you guys, too!
 You mean... the others, too?
 No!
 Stop it! I don't want to fight my friends!
 Wake up!
 We're—
 Yu...no?
 H-Hey... Don't tell me...
 Yuno's an enemy, too?

 What? Captain Vangeance from the Golden Dawn?
 Yeah. He's also the leader of the  Eye of the Midnight Sun, Licht.
 What the heck does that mean?
 ""William is asleep inside  me,"" is what he said.
 So his body was taken over?
 Don't ask me!
 On top of that, he's not the  only one who went all weird.
 It affected other Magic Knights, too.
 Marx, Old Man Owen, and the Spiny Prickly Queen.
 Even Captain Charlotte?!
 A lot of crap happened while you  were enjoying your beauty sleep.
 You do realize I was dying, right?!
 Yeah, I guess.
 There's nothing to guess!
 Man, I was so worried.
 At least sound like you mean it!
 No, really. I was.
 I couldn't even sleep at night.
 I'm glad you weren't taken over.
 Wait... Does that mean Langris's  body was also taken over?
 Probably.
 That ominous mana... Is that  why he tried to kill me?
 Hey, Finral.
 Let's go.
 Right!
 Langris, this time...
 I'll stop you for sure.
 Flame Magic: Explosive Scattershot!
 Not bad, you virgin delinquent.
 What the hell are you doing here?
 I was heading back from visiting Finral.
 I thought you might be all  alone and crying somewhere,
 so I came to see you.
 Who the hell is crying?! And get  the hell off my Crazy Cyclone!
 Damn it... Just don't get  in the way of my training.
 Right about now, Asta,  Noelle, and Luck are fighting
 the guys from the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Probably.
 I want to make sure I don't embarrass  them as their senior knight.
 So...
 I'm going to get even stronger!
 I promise I'll make it back alive!
 So head on back first!
 Hey, Yuno! Yuno!
 It's no use. None of us know you.
 Yuno!
 I just told you it was futile.
 I think it's time we made you quiet down.
 Klaus, please don't...
 Asta!
 Stop this, Klaus! We're both Magic Knights!
 This body is... reacting?
 Hmph! Our hatred for you
 is far stronger than your  pathetic little bond!
 Come on, now. If you push yourself  too hard, you're gonna die.
 What a pain...
 Of course, we won't need you anymore  once we get your grimoire and swords.
 It doesn't look like you're going to give up.
 In that case...
 If you want to protect your precious  little royal friend and die,
 go right ahead.
 No...
 Not yet...
 Huh?
 I'm not going to die yet!
 I promised my friends I'd come back alive!
 I won't let my friends kill my other friends!
 I'll survive this. I'll survive all of this...
 And then...
 I'll become the Wizard King!
 But you're the one who gave me hope.
 Even if you're poor, an orphan...
 or even us...
 We can become greater than anyone  else in this world. And to prove that...
 To make Sister and everyone else happy...
 Let's see who can become the Wizard King!
 What in the world are you babbling about  now, when you can hardly even move?
 This is where...
 ...you're going to...
 ...die!
 What are you talking about, Asta?
 I'm the one who's going  to become the Wizard King!
 Yuno?
 Y-Yuno?! Y-You... Hey!
 Wait, are you... Are you actually Yuno?!
 Yeah. Why?
 What?! But your ears are hella pointy!
 Yeah, apparently they are. So?
 But, I mean... you're normal?!
 You're right!
 Look, Yuno! Our ears match!
 Bell, could you quiet down a bit?
 Now's not the time for that, Miss Spirit Lady!
 Wha...
 What the heck?!
 Stop staring at the little shrimp  and look at how much I've grown!
 Who the heck are you calling a shrimp?! You're way smaller than me!
 What did you say?!
 You're both way too loud.
 What in the world is going on?
 Would one of you kindly  get me down from here?
 I'm me. You got a problem with that?
 Nope! Not at all!
 Why the heck are you two having a moment?
 More importantly, look at m—
 So you've awakened.
 You're one of us. Now, come here.
 Hey...
 Could you not butt in?
 This mana... The reincarnation  definitely worked.
 But it looks like he's still...
 Licht's grimoire and swords are right  in front of him, and he hasn't responded.
 I guess it could be because he used the
 ultimate forbidden spell to  bring back his elf friends.
 Looks like they might need more time.
 Both Licht... and you.
 I can tell.
 What's moving their bodies right now  are souls that belong to others.
 Klaus and Hamon's souls have been put to sleep.
 Really?! Then we can save them?
 Th-Thank you very much, Asta.
 And also inside me...
 Yuno?
 But...
 I am a Magic Knight of  the Clover Kingdom, Yuno.
 No one else.
 Clearly, that vessel is a human  with a very strong will.
 It appears he hasn't fully awakened yet.
 Humans are such a nuisance...
 We're going to kill those two behind you,  and then have you leave that body!
 Oh?
 Those bodies belong to my senior knights.
 You're going to have to leave.
 Looks like we have no choice.
 We'll have to give it everything we've got.
 The ground's shaking just from  you guys glaring at each other!
 Oh, crap!
 I don't know how we're going  to get them out of there.
 We may have to incapacitate and bind them.
 I'll stop them.
 You take Mimosa and get back.
 Asta?
 Like hell I'm gonna let you do this alone!
 Yuno, you jerk!
 Yuno's not alone! He has me!
 Mimosa, this might be rough,  but step back a bit.
 O-Okay.
 With the grimoires and  knowledge from this age,
 we will be able to use even more  refined spells than existed in our age.
 It appears so.
 Combination Spell: Le Chateau du Verre!
 It's over.
 Well, that thing sure looks crazy.
 You got this, Yuno?
 That's some intense magic.
 I won't have time to cover you, Asta.
 Bring it on!
 Go, Le Chateau du Verre!
 We won't lose...
 ...to you!
 You two are amazing!
 The anti-magic kid is one thing,
 but that other guy who hasn't  fully awakened even though
 his magic grew exponentially after  being reincarnated is a pain, too.
 Licht?
 He's not even using magic, and he's  able to make himself and others float?
 You can't be serious. His mana is so incredibly dense.
 The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun...
 And that sword...
 Nero?!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 What?! What?! What?! What?! What?!
 Hey, wait! Stop that, ow, ow, ow!
 This ki...
 There's incredible magic  coming from that sword.
 Oh, crap... My black form  is reaching its limit.
 Please... Just last a little longer.
 Asta, be careful.
 Yeah, I know!
 This goes way beyond fast...
 It's like he melted into the air.  I can't even read his ki!
 It's as though he became one with  the mana of nature itself.
 I can't sense his mana!
 Asta!
 Wind Spirit Binding Magic: Liable Tempest!
 Don't miss!
 That doesn't sound like you, Yuno!
 How was that?
 Asta, behind you!
 Damn... it?!
 What are we going to do about  that guy's teleporting, Asta?
 I'm gonna surpass my limits right now!
 You can't be serious!
 Wind Spirit Magic...
 Spirit Storm!
 He sucked up my magic?
 This is just one of the  Demon-Dweller Sword's true powers.
 H-He's so strong...
 And what the heck's going on with my sword?
 What the heck is going on in general?
 Damn it... Don't stop moving  at a time like this, body!
 That brat's probably reached  his limits... though, so have I.
 I'll give him credit for  getting this far, though.
 Asta... Yuno...
 Even if I wanted to try  healing them, my magic is...
 I can't find an opening with him.
 In that case, I'll...
 Not yet...
 Not yet...
 Not yet...
 He's starting to keep up with  how fast those attacks are.
 Not bad.
 Not yet!
 How about this?
 Mana Zone...
 Wait, that's that one lady's...
 Licht!
 Spirit Storm!
 It's amazing enough that he  managed to find an opening
 with Licht, even though he hasn't  completely awakened yet.
 I'd expect nothing less from Licht's...
 Wha—
 I thought he couldn't move anymore!
 This is when Asta will surpass his limits!
 Not yet!
 Their timing is perfect!
 What the hell is with those two?!
 Yuno is my...
 Asta is my...
 ...rival!
 He blocked our attack with that sword?
 He's condensing a phenomenal  amount of magic...
 Yuno's wind?
 The leader of the Eye of the  Midnight Sun, Licht, is so strong!
 But I promised Zora I would come back alive!
 Not to mention, I've got Yuno, too!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Bring it on!
 Go, Le Chateau de Verre!
 We won't lose...

 Asta and Yuno worked together to  defeat Klaus and Hamon, but then...

 That's some hole you opened up there, Licht.
 You sure that was okay, though?
 You sorta blasted your sword  and grimoire along with it.
 Guess he can't talk just yet.
 That grimoire... no longer belongs to me.
 Licht...
 Let us go, Raia.
 Licht is definitely here.  That's all that matters right now.
 Asta!
 Jeez, what's his problem?  Yuno's all wet now!
 What if I catch a cold?!
 Next time I see you,  I'm giving it right back to you!
 Zora...
 This way. The Silver Eagles'  captain is over here, too.
 They're just unconscious.
 Hey, Raia.
 Hey, Ado.
 How have you been?
 Not too bad.
 He hasn't awakened yet?
 Yeah... We'll probably just  have to wait patiently
 until he completely awakens.
 Indeed.
 How about everyone else?
 One moment.
 It's been so long, everyone!  About 500 years, is it?
 I'm glad you all seem well.
 Well, let's go...
 To get our other friends,  and to destroy the humans.
 I passed out!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! My whole body hurts!
 And I'm soaked! Everything hurts!
 You sure are loud when you wake up.
 Ugh! You're making my  ears go all stupid, stupid!
 Who're you calling stupid— ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Stupid.
 Asta... Thank goodness.
 Mimosa! I'm glad everyone's  okay—ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Wait, where the heck  did their hideout go?!
 This really sucks,
 but while you were asleep, it started  heading toward the royal capital.
 Wh-What?! Wait, Zora—ow, ow, ow, ow!
 You actually did come back alive...
 Just how lucky are you, you little shit?
 Where's Mereoleona—ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 She's still pleasantly knocked out.
 Thank goodness she's okay...
 Doesn't seem like she's  waking up any time soon.
 And she'd probably kill us if we woke her.
 Thank goodness we're all okay.
 Mushroom guy and the Captain  of the Silv—ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Well, the other two became our enemies.
 With my mushroom smokescreen and
 with Nozel's magic's mobility,  we somehow made it out.
 I see... So others also—ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Asta of the Black Bulls...
 He managed to escape from  a situation that left
 even Mereoleona unconscious.
 I'm gonna recover some stamina  with these herbs—ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Here, have some!
 Uh, okay.
 You can't be serious.  You're not supposed to eat those raw.
 You'll get a tummy ache.
 B-But Asta gave these to me...  I'll eat them, even if they're raw!
 Magic Item: Eilia's Booth.
 It's a magic item that explosively heightens  your body's natural healing ability.
 You lot can use it.
 Th-Thank you very much!
 I-I can actually feel the  pain starting to fade!
 Letting us use such a high-level magic item... Thank you so much, Nozel.
 I don't know how he can see past that hair,  but maybe he's not such a bad guy.
 Yuno, may all your owies...  fly over to that shrimp!
 Don't send them to me!
 Do you hurt anymore? Are you okay?
 Yeah.
 Thank goodness!
 Everyone! You're safe!
 Noelle!
 Noelle, and...
 ...a really beaten-up Kirsch!
 Mimosa's bro! Get your butt in here!
 I'm still beautiful,  even when I'm covered in blood.
 This is not the time for that!
 I'm even beautiful when I'm being healed.
 Who's this guy? Is he stupid, too?!
 Noelle! Where are the others?
 I'm not sure what happened,  but Luck turned into an enemy.
 Even Luck?
 The fellow from the Crimson Lion Kings, too.
 The same happened to us with Klaus and Hamon.
 Same with Rill and some others.
 No...
 They're all pathetic.
 U-Uh... Look at you! A-Are you okay?
 I'm perfectly fine. I'm overflowing  with magic right now.
 Oh, fine. I'll explain it to you.
 Who do you think you are? I'm royalty!
 Who cares?! I'm the Wind Spirit!
 So what?!
 The spatial mage who should've  been on standby is gone.
 So apparently, he also...
 Captain Nozel! Captain Nozel,  can you hear me?!
 What's the matter?
 Captain Nozel! Thank goodness!  I finally got through to you!
 What's that?
 It's a special communication magic  item that all the captains use.
 A number of our squad members  suddenly went berserk
 and started saying strange  things like, ""We're elves!""
 They have way more magic than usual!  We can't handle them on our own!
 Apparently, similar incidents are  happening with all of the squads.
 There's something going  on all over the kingdom—
 What's wrong? Come in.
 The same thing is happening  all over the kingdom?!
 Well, this sucks.
 We are Magic Knights.
 We must save the Clover Kingdom,  no matter what happens.
 Even if we have to kill  our fellow Magic Knights.
 And even if we get killed.
 Luck...
 Luck's attacks didn't hit me.
 Whoopsie. It's been so long, I missed.
 ...get up close and personal.
 Despite how fast he was,  we were able to get away.
 I think...
 Luck made sure that would happen.
 He did hit me, though.
 Good.
 That must mean Luck's soul is fighting, too.
 Just as Yuno is doing okay,
 I'm sure the others will be  able to regain their senses!
 There must be a way.
 We, the Magic Knights, are going to save them!
 Both the kingdom and our friends!
 Yeah!
 Yes, let's.
 All right...
 Let's go!
 What the heck is going on?
 Just after those swords of light were  about to fall on us, they disappeared...
 Then the demon's skull started shining.
 I'm so scared.
 Hey... Over there!
 What?
 What now?
 A golden... dawn?
 No... That's not it!
 Something's coming.
 It's flying toward the royal capital.
 What the heck is that?
 Those are my friends.
 Friends?
 That robe is a Magic Knight's robe.
 U-Um... Pardon me, Sir Magic Knight.
 It appears that you humans
 have increased your numbers  tremendously in the past few centuries.
 Um...
 This must be the region where the  ones with weakest magic reside.
 And as you move toward  the center of the kingdom,
 that's where the ones with the  most powerful magic reside.
 It appears that you humans still  practice this senseless discrimination.
 He is a Magic Knight... right?
 I think so.
 It appears that you weaklings are the  ones being discriminated against now.
 You truly are selfish creatures.
 Wh-Who are you?
 We do not discriminate.
 We will bring death upon  all of you humans equally.
 Poison Plant Magic:  Zhovniir's Garden of Lingering Burns.
 All right! I'm completely healed!
 Wh-Why did you have to strip?!
 I was just checking to see  if all my wounds healed!
 Hurry up and put your shirt  back on! Are you stupid?!
 Now that I've completely healed,  I'm even more beautiful!
 I wish you hadn't healed.
 Her wounds have completely healed,  but she still shows no sign of waking up.
 Let her sleep.
 Thank you so much for this!
 It's disposable, so dispose of it.
 Really?! Well, it's super pretty,  so I'll just keep it!
 Do as you please.
 We should be in the Forsaken Realm soon.
 What's wrong?
 Looks like some place is  already being attacked.
 That's...
 ...Hage Village!
 That's our hometown! We need to save them!
 No.
 We have to reach the  royal capital immediately.
 Protecting the kingdom means that  protecting the royal capital comes first.
 My hometown is part of this kingdom, too!
 If you insist on going,  the two of you can go alone.
 But you two are vital in battle.
 Deal with this quickly, then head  straight to the royal capital.
 Yes, sir!
 I'll go, too.
 You may not go, Noelle.
 Nozel?!
 You are royalty.
 You're going to come with  me to protect the castle.
 Together with you?
 Your existence itself is unnecessary.
 You do not belong here.
 Begone.
 Understood! I shall accompany you!
 I always thought it was strange...  that I had this type of magic.
 Poisonous plants? Really?
 But I finally understand why.
 It hurts...
 Help... me... It feels  like my body is burning...
 It was so I could weed out all  these pointless, unnecessary lives.
 Water Creation Magic: Holy Fist of Love!
 There are no unnecessary lives!
 Father...
 You'll be okay!
 It looks like a few of you  can use decent magic.
 Are you what the humans call nobility?
 Then again, all humans  are powerless before us.
 What the heck is that monster?
 How can you do something so awful?
 I don't know what happened to you,
 but what did the people of  this village ever do to you?
 We're just trying to live  our lives out here.
 S'okay! Owies, owies, go away!
 We cry...
 Ugh! I don't get this at all!
 We face hardships...
 I really don't know how we're going  to make it through the winter.
 We suffer, but still...
 Tatoes again?
 No complaining.
 I love tatoes!
 Your tato dishes are delicious, Sister.
 If you don't want yours, give 'em here.
 Who said I didn't want them?!
 Of course I'm gonna eat them!
 W-Water!
 Still, we laugh and have dreams.
 We're living the best we can!
 There's no way we should  meet such a sad end!
 That's right!
 Orphans like us, who are poor...  aren't allowed to dream like that.
 Nash...
 You can't give up right from the get-go!
 Possibilities exist in everyone!
 It doesn't matter if you're  poor or an orphan.
 Anyone in this world can become amazing.
 They can do anything.
 They can make their dreams come true.
 They can make everyone happy!
 And I'll prove that to you!
 If, just if, and it's a very huge if...
 If you get into the Magic Knights...
 Yeah?
 I'll believe in possibilities.  I'll believe I can become anything.
 And then one day, I'll get into  the Magic Knights, too.
 No, never mind.
 After we leave, you'll be  the biggest brother here!
 Make sure you protect everyone.  We're counting on you, Nash!
 True... No one should have to face a sad end.
 That's why I'm going to eliminate  the root of all sadness: humans.
 Poison Plant Magic:  Zhovniir's Garden of Lingering Burns.
 S-Sister! Don't you dare touch her!
 Nash! No!
 Asta... Yuno?
 Father! It's Asta! Asta's here!

 Good job fighting...

 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.

 Two Miracles
 How impressive of you to block my attack.
 I believe the same goes for  this body's human as well,
 but are you Magic Knights?
 How about this, then?
 Poison Plant Magic: Zhovniir's Breath...
 and Zhovniir's Fingers.
 Like the other humans, you can die from poison
 or get skewered.
 Choose.
 We refuse!
 They're both amazing.
 It's a miracle...
 You were both abandoned in front  of the church on the same day,
 and grew up in this village.
 Then you ventured off, dreaming of  becoming the Wizard King someday.
 To think that Asta and Yuno...
 have grown so much, and now...  they've come to save this village.
 Asta said...
 Your dreams can come true as  long as you don't give up.
 That you can make everyone happy.
 Yes.
 Even though we haven't seen them for so long,
 we know...
 how hard those two have worked for  their dream to become the Wizard King.
 Oh?
 Well done, Yuno!
 He made it into the Magic Knights!  He's truly our pride!
 Yuno's so cool!
 So cool!
 I have to let the whole village know!
 So, Sister, what does the  letter from Asta say?
 Man, his handwriting sucks.  When's he coming home?
 We'll have to cheer him up  when he comes back.
 I'm sure even Asta would  be depressed about that.
 We'll have a super tato party.
 He says he passed.
 Huh?
 Asta passed, too.
 What?!
 Seriously?!
 Wow... He really passed.
 Th-Then I guess he won't be coming home.
 I see... So they both passed.
 All right, I'm going to tell the whole village!
 This is the first bit of good news we've gotten since Hage Village was founded!
 Yeah!
 I see. So Asta passed, too... I see.
 Ever since then,
 all the letters we'd  receive from Asta and Yuno
 became something we looked forward to.
 Dear Sister Lily...
 Nash, Rekka, Arlu, Horo...  How are you guys doing?
 My first mission after joining  the Black Bulls was boar hunting!
 I even encountered a super strong enemy.
 You have no chance of winning.  Why won't you give up?
 If I give up, who's going to protect them?
 I've realized something.
 It's not just because of our promise.
 I'm going to become the Wizard King
 so I can protect everyone!
 Here we go, Asta!
 Take this! My last remaining bit of magic!
 Soul Ball!
 Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!
 So this is your final spell?
 How wasteful.
 It's time.
 It's not a waste!
 They drew us in with a decoy,  then used our blind spot...
 Magic reflection!
 Not yet!
 I can still move!
 W-Wait...
 Like hell I will!
 We somehow won,  but we weren't able to stop
 the enemies from taking their own lives,
 or save all of the villagers.
 At this rate,
 it'll be a long time before  I become the Wizard King.
 But still, I'm still never going to give up!
 If anything, he's better at not  giving up than anyone else.
 You can do this, Asta!
 Do this!
 ""P.S. Marry me, Sister Lily! From Asta.""
 Asta's the same as ever.
 At least give that part up already.
 Read Yuno's letter next!
 Read it! Read it!
 Yuno!
 Wait, wait. I'll read that letter myself.
 Let's see...
 ""To everyone back at the church.
 When I went to the Magic Knight  Headquarters the other day,
 I met the Wizard King. Yuno.""
 That's so cool!
 What else does it say?
 That's it, actually.
 Yuno's letters are always so short.
 Asta actually wrote a lot more about that.
 Let's see...
 ""Yuno and I went to the headquarters  to give a report about a mission.""
 Y-Your Majesty!
 I never expected you to welcome us yourself.
 Who's that flashy old guy?
 You fool! That's the current  Wizard King, Julius Novachrono!
 What?!
 This guy is the current...
 ...Wizard King?!
 Well, anyway, you all did  splendidly. Good work.
 U-U-Um, d-d-do you have a moment?
 What is it?
 H-How...
 ...do you become the Wizard King?
 I see. So you both want  to become the Wizard King.
 Any Magic Knight should  have that aspiration.
 You two! It's rude to ask the Wizard King that directly.
 Listen. The Wizard King must be proud  and have the trust of the people—
 No.
 It's merit.
 You can't protect others with pride, and the trust of others comes with merit.
 There is only one thing people  want from the Wizard King...
 Merit that proves they are the best.
 Gain merit.
 Continuously gaining merit is everything.
 Anyone who can't do that  can never stand at the top.
 Bring it on!
 To gain merit that proves we're the best...
 Those were simple, but very deep words.
 I'm going to get more and more merit...  The most that I can!
 Asta and Yuno are doing their best in  a world that we who live on the outskirts
 of the Forsaken Realm could never imagine.
 Their hard work gave us courage and hope.
 But...
 Dear everyone back at Hage Village.
 Our next mission is
 exploring the Underwater Temple  that's at the bottom of the ocean!
 After we received this letter,
 we stopped receiving  letters from Asta for a while.
 They sometimes say that no news is good news,
 but we were all very worried about Asta  after we stopped hearing from him.
 After a while, we received a  very, very, very long letter,
 as though he had been holding in  all his thoughts for some time,
 and we were very surprised.
 Dear everyone back at Hage Village...
 I'm sorry I haven't been  able to write for a while.
 I really wanted to write  you guys, but I couldn't.
 Asta's letter said that after  fighting an organization called
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun  at the Underwater Temple,
 curse magic was placed on his arms.
 And according to the doctor,  he'd never be able to write letters,
 let alone hold a sword again.
 Hearing that, his friends  from the Black Bulls
 did everything they could to find a cure.
 Then he said that after he  met the Queen of Witches
 in the Witches' Forest, the curse was lifted.
 Never giving up...
 is my magic!
 That's quite the transformation.
 But what exactly are you going to do with it?!
 You're not getting away!
 Damn you!
 What... the hell?
 What the hell are you?
 Get out of my sight!
 Why?!
 I got this far by kicking  everyone else down!
 Why are you...
 You might've kicked people down,
 but everyone that helped boost me up
 makes me strong!
 Black Meteorite!
 Soon after that, the letters we received  from Asta and Yuno said that
 they had participated in the Star Festival,
 and that many of their achievements had been
 acknowledged by the people  in the royal capital.
 Well, that was quite the entrance.
 This is the rookie who worked the hardest  out of the Black Bulls this past year.
 Asta!
 Oh, hey. Hey, there.
 Yuno and Asta placed first and second in  obtaining stars among all the rookies.
 They're two new rising stars.
 In only six months since they  joined the Magic Knights,
 they've both built up magnificent records.
 On top of that, they're childhood friends,  and they're both just sixteen.
 They're both very impressive youngsters.
 I wonder what noble families they're from.
 Nope! Apparently they're  peasants from the boonies!
 Bah-ha! Not to mention that Asta  kid doesn't even have any magic!
 They're peasants? No way.
 He doesn't have magic?
 Did they really use their  abilities to rise up the ranks?
 Ugh! What's with these people?
 Bell.
 What?
 Full power.
 I wouldn't have it any other way.
 Uh, Yuno? What are you doing?
 Asta...
 Doesn't this remind you of the  training we did when we were little?
 The hell?! Why do you keep doing  stuff like that outta nowhere?!
 Besides, we're not kids anymore!
 Are you trying to kill me in the middle  of my big moment?! You ass!
 If you had died there,  then that's all you were worth.
 Glad you survived.
 What?!
 S-Such powerful magic...
 And the other guy stopped it?
 They're on a completely different level!
 Now that you've seen their powers,
 if any of you still doubt their  achievements, please come forward.
 It's true that they're both peasants.
 But they've worked harder  than anyone to get here.
 Proud citizens of the Clover Kingdom!
 A round of applause for  these two new Magic Knights!
 And... let us overcome  our differences in status,
 band together, and lead  our country to victory!
 Wizard King...
 I guess peasants aren't too bad.
 Yeah! Now's not the time to  be talking about status!
 Let's all work together!
 Yuno...
 Yeah.
 We...
 actually made it this far.
 Dear everyone back at Hage Village...
 I...
 I...
 ...will become the Wizard  King, no matter what!
 It just keeps growing back,  no matter how many times I cut it.
 There's no end to this stuff!
 Father!
 Please wake up!
 Don't die!
 Poison?
 I might be able to fix it like last  time with my Demon-Slayer Sword!
 Yuno!
 Can you fight on your own for a while?
 Of course I can! Actually,  I'll defeat him myself anyway!
 Good! I'll leave him to you for a bit!
 Father!
 Asta! Father was trying to protect us and...
 Please...
 Damn it! It didn't work!
 It's not a spell anymore. The spell's effects...
 have already gone into effect,
 and the poison's circulating through his body.
 Father...
 I might be done for...
 Father! You've got this!
 Is that you, Asta?
 I got to see you and Yuno  after you've grown so much.
 I couldn't ask for anything else.
 This must be my reward from God.
 What are you talking about?!
 To think that little Asta
 has grown so much...
 Take care of... everyone for me...
 Father!
 Father...
 Not yet...
 Not yet, Father!
 Don't die. You can't die!
 You still... You still need  to see how much more I...
 how much more we can grow!
 This sword...
 It's the sword he took back at the  Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout.
 It somehow ended up back in my grimoire.
 Maybe with this sword, I can...
 To think I used to change those boys' diapers.  They've grown so much!
 You are both my precious sons!

 To get our other friends,  and to destroy the humans.
 All right...
 Let's go!
 Asta and Yuno also headed  toward the royal capital
 to save the Clover Kingdom, but...
 On the way there,
 they realized that their hometown,  Hage Village, was under attack,
 so they split off from Nozel  and the others to head there.
 Leave the rest to us!
 How about this, then?
 Poison Plant Magic: Zofnir's Breath...
 and Zofnir's Fingers.
 Asta tried to cure the effects  of the poison plant magic,
 which had afflicted the priest.
 But even with the Demon-Slayer Sword,  he was unable to reverse its effects.
 Not yet, Father!
 Don't die. You can't die!
 You still... You still need  to see how much more I...
 how much more we can grow!
 This sword...
 Back at the Eye of the  Midnight Sun's hideout... He...
 It somehow ended up back in my grimoire.
 Maybe with this sword, I can...
 Release from Misfortune
 Wait, isn't that the sword  the evil boss guy was using?
 That sword... Why does he have it?
 What in the world is going on?
 What's wrong, Asta?
 The amount of black power  flowing into this sword
 is far beyond the other swords...
 Concentrate.
 Don't go against this flow.  Take it in instead.
 Make it an extension of myself.
 Now!
 Th-This is...
 Huh?
 The poison is disappearing.
 Please, make it in time!
 Father!
 Wh-What's going...
 Is this a dream? I thought I died.
 Asta made you all better!
 Yeah!
 Thank goodness. You're amazing...  You're amazing, Asta!
 All right! But, uh,  this sword is pretty wild!
 But maybe with this power...
 I'll be able to turn all  my friends back to normal!
 He managed to take away all  the effects of the poison.
 That sword...
 What are you looking at?
 Mana Zone: Crescent Moon Sickle,  Four Blades!
 Wh-What's going on?
 You're being affected by the same  reincarnation spell as us,
 so why do you still retain that human's will?
 And doesn't... doesn't the power  of that sword belong to Licht?
 Why... How can a human with  absolutely no magical power...
 Wh-What is this?
 What are you people?!
 Disgusting... tainted... humans!
 Thank goodness. I think I'll  make it to Licht's wedding.
 Oh, come on.
 Are you really giving them those  creepy flowers as a present?
 A-Are they? But they aren't poisonous,  and I think they're really pretty.
 I'd be happy to have them.
 Licht!
 The meaning behind those flowers  is ""kindness hidden within.""
 Elves and birds won't go near  them because they look poisonous.
 But since the bugs know that,  it's their sanctuary.
 Don't you think that's just the same as elves and humans?
 We don't know much about each other,
 so we dislike or even hate one another.
 I'm sure Tetia will love the flowers, too.
 Thank you.
 O-Of course!
 We tried to understand them.
 And they let us know...  just how vile they were!
 Humans... I cannot forgive you!
 Stay out of our way!
 This feeling...
 Humans, humans, humans, humans...
 Humans, humans, humans, humans, humans...
 He's not trying to control his magic at all!  His soul is going out of control!
 Yeah, I can tell from his mana.
 The elf's soul inside him is in pain.
 It's like the elves are asking for help.
 Yuno!
 Let's go, Asta!
 At this rate, he's going to turn  into something besides an elf.
 We have to set him free.
 Oh, no!
 He blocked Yuno's attack!
 I've opened a path for you, Asta!
 Just how vile they were!
 Humans... I cannot forgive you!
 Stay out of our way!
 Humans, humans, humans, humans...
 Humans, humans, humans, humans, humans...
 He's not trying to control his magic at all!  His soul is going out of control!
 Yeah, I can tell from his mana.
 The elf's soul inside him is in pain.
 It's like the elves are asking for help.
 Yuno!
 Let's go, Asta!
 At this rate, he's going to turn  into something besides an elf.
 We have to set him free.
 I've opened a path for you, Asta!
 He negated... the reincarnation spell?
 With this sword...  I'll be able to save everyone!
 The only reason we won is because of Yuno! You'd better be grateful!
 I wouldn't say he's the only reason!
 All you had to do was hold your sword,  so it was basically 100% me.
 What?! If you were 100%,  then 500% of it was me!
 You can't be serious. On many levels.
 Moron.
 Asta!
 Whoa!
 Yuno!
 I thought we were finished...  You're amazing, Asta!
 Great job protecting Sister, Nash.
 Thanks for saving us!
 I was so scared!
 Hey! Get your hands off Yuno!
 Wow! She's so tiny and cute!
 She looks like a doll!
 Let's play dress-up!
 Hey! Stop that!
 Asta... Yuno...
 Father!
 Are you okay?!
 I'm still a bit dizzy, but...
 Looks like the poison's  left everyone else, too.
 Thank you for saving us all.
 You two...
 have grown so much!
 Yes! I love you! Please marry m—
 Water Creation Magic: Holy Fist of Love!
 Oh, no! I did that impulsively!
 I've missed this so much!
 Can I get another shot?!
 What?!
 You can't be serious.
 Hey, your ears are all pointy, Yuno.
 You're right!
 Yeah! He matches me!
 Asta, Yuno... What's going  on in this kingdom?
 One horrifying thing after  another keeps happening,
 and I have no idea what's going on.
 We don't have much time,  but we should probably tell them.
 Yeah. Another Magic Knight who's been  reincarnated as an elf might attack.
 Don't worry! When it comes to  this kingdom and its people...
 ...we'll do everything we can to protect them!
 Your Majesty!
 Your Majesty!
 There's trouble, Your Majesty!
 What's all the racket?! You've got  some nerve to disturb my slumber!
 I-I sincerely apologize!  But this is an emergency!
 The royal capital is being  attacked by several mages!
 Just have Julius deal with that.
 A-Actually, the Wizard King is missing,  and we can't seem to reach him.
 The Magic Knights'  headquarters is in chaos!
 Wh-What?! At a time like this?
 But that's fine.
 H-Huh?
 This means it's finally my time to shine.
 He always... always, always, always...
 always stole the spotlight from me!
 Now I will take command in place of Julius,  who was always stepping on my toes!
 How lovely, Your Majesty!
 You're the best, Your Majesty!
 Send an order for the Magic Knight  captains to gather immediately!
 Er, that's already been done.
 But most of the captains didn't  even respond to the summons.
 And we've received word that some of
 the captains and Magic Knights  have turned on us.
 Wh-What?!
 Apparently Langris,  who was detained, has escaped,
 and he seems to be leading this attack  along with the rest of the Golden Dawn.
 It appears that our other  comrades who reincarnated
 have finally made their move.
 I hope they save some for us,  but that might be asking for too much.
 I may be a calm man, but even I have trouble  holding back when I see those humans.
 I'm pretty sure you always
 acted calm and collected when  you were actually pretty feisty.
 Honestly though, I can't hold back, either.
 We can understand each other.
 I mean, we're basically the same as them.
 They're mad because something  precious to them was hurt.
 Sorry, kid, but no one can stop us now.
 Those two should be waking up soon.  You should just give up.
 I felt immense magical power well up,  then immediately disappear.
 That magic was intense. But I'm  sure Asta and Yuno are fine!
 They promised to head to the royal capital  right after they saved their village!
 Yes, we should do our best, too.
 They separated from us with resolve.
 You need to concentrate on  what you should be doing right now.
 Yes, sir.
 An den der boss named  Lich was shuper strong...
 Asta, we have no idea what you're saying.
 Look, either talk or eat. Pick one!
 I can't help it! We don't have ti—
 Are you okay, Asta?
 You may be stronger now,  but nothing else has changed.
 So basically, some of your fellow  Magic Knights reincarnated as elves
 and are attacking us humans. Is that it?
 Yes! Exactly!
 I'm amazed you understood him.
 Well, I did raise him, after all.
 And to think Asta grew into  such a fine young man...
 Yuno was always a fine young man, but...
 Father's crying again.
 Yeah.
 I'm just so happy...
 Excuse me...
 Wh-Who the heck are you?!
 Did you forget me already?
 I was the one fighting you a little earlier.
 You saved me after my body  was taken over by an elf.
 My name is Digit...
 Member of the Purple Orcas Digit Taliss
 Ah...
 That's what you're actually like?
 Yes! This is what I'm actually like!
 How could this have happened?
 Oh, I'm a Magic Knight belonging  to the Purple Orcas.
 And you know, our former  captain, Gueldre,
 was accepting bribes and  had lots of other problems.
 So I was patrolling the Forsaken Realm  to try to help our reputation recover...
 Wow! These are endangered horseface berries!
 And these carnivorous plants aren't  listed in any encyclopedias!
 The Forsaken Realm is
 full of rare plants you can't  find back in the royal capital!
 As I was traveling, I got lost.
 The next thing I knew, I wasn't me anymore,
 and I was attacking this village!
 I still don't know what's going on!
 Seriously, what in the world is going on?!
 You can't be serious.
 But there's one thing I'm certain of.
 The soul of the elf that had  reincarnated in me didn't want this.
 He didn't want to hate or fight anyone.
 Let's go, Yuno!
 We have to save the humans  and the elves, too!
 Yeah.
 Huh? You're leaving already?
 But we finally got to see you.
 No!
 We wanna hear more stories!
 Come, now. We can't be selfish.
 Asta and Yuno have to go protect this kingdom.
 There are others in trouble,  just like we were.
 Aw...
 Will you write to us again?
 Yeah.
 Of course!
 You better improve your handwriting, Asta!
 Your letters are super hard to read!
 Huh?
 Asta and Yuno... Don't you dare die, no matter what!
 Yeah!
 Next time, we'll have more  time to talk, old man!
 Call me ""Father"" or ""Priest,"" darn it!
 Okay, Old Man Priest!
 You don't need the ""old man"" part!
 Um... Would you take me with you?
 Despite how I look, I am a Magic Knight.
 Yeah!
 All right, let's go!
 Well, see ya!
 We're gonna go save the kingdom!
 Asta!
 Yuno!
 We appreciate the letters and the money,
 but nothing beats you both coming home safe!
 Be careful!
 Sister! I love you!
 Shut up.
 They're going to save the kingdom, eh?
 Our little Asta, who can't  even use any magic...
 Yuno's the hope of Hage Village now,
 but he used to be so timid  and would cry all the time.
 Honestly, you both grew  up so unbelievably fast!
 Be careful, you hear me?!
 What the hell is that giant  boulder-looking thing?
 All right, I guess I'll go have some fun.
 We're pretty late after all that happened.
 We have to hurry!
 Up ahead, I feel elven magic from  both the north and the south.
 It could be that some of the Magic Knights
 who were reincarnated as elves,  like me, are attacking humans.
 Wh-What should we do? We're hurrying  to the royal capital, right?
 Even if they're not from  the royal capital or Hage,
 they're still citizens of this kingdom!
 Guess that settles it.
 Since there are two places, it'd be  better if we split up and helped them.
 Um... Who should I go with?
 Go with Yuno!
 I'll be fine alone.
 Go with Asta.
 Yeah, yeah! Yuno's way stronger than you!
 What the heck? Just take  him with you, Yuno!
 Go with Asta.
 With Yuno!
 P-Please calm down!  Please don't fight over me!
 Asta! Asta! Asta!
 Yuno! Yuno! Yuno!
 I can turn our friends who became  elves back to normal with this sword!
 You can't take anyone down for real,
 so it's better if you have him with you.
 As annoying as that is, you're right.
 How is that annoying?!
 I guess he can at least incapacitate  the enemy with paralyzing poison.
 I'm not sure if I completely follow,  but I'm pretty sure that was mean!
 Yuno!
 Asta!
 See you at the royal capital!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Splitting Up
 Splitting Up.
 Asta, are you sure you want to split  up and go off on your own?
 Don't mock me! Of course  I'm fine with that!
 Are you absolutely positive?
 Yeah!
 I'll ask you just one more time.  Are you sure you're okay with splitting up?
 I said yes!
 What? Are you gonna be lonely, Yuno?
 You can't be serious.
 Okay, let's split up, then!
 See you at the royal capital!
 Yeah.
 See ya.
 So mean!
 What the heck?!
 So mean...
 I came because I heard  the town was being attacked!
 What the hell, Luck?!
 Whoa, hey!
 Why the hell are you attacking me?!
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 104:  ""Lightning of Rage vs. Friends.""

104,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Licht and his comrades finally  completed their reincarnation
 and headed to the royal capital  to commence their attack.
 Nozel, Noelle, Mimosa, Zora, Kirsch, En,
 and Mereoleona, who was still knocked out,
 left the hideout and headed  back toward the royal capital.
 Looks like some place is  already being attacked.
 That's...
 ...Hage Village!
 Sister!
 Nash! No!
 Asta and Yuno took a different route in  order to save their home, Hage Village,
 from an attack by a Magic Knight  who'd reincarnated as an elf.
 Asta... Yuno?
 Good job fighting...
 ...Nash!
 Leave the rest to us!
 Crescent Moon Sickle, Four Blades!
 I can tell from his mana.
 The elf's soul inside him is in pain.
 It's like the elves are asking for help.
 Yuno!
 Let's go, Asta!
 At this rate, he's going to turn  into something besides an elf.
 We have to set him free.
 He negated... the reincarnation spell?
 With this sword...  I'll be able to save everyone!
 Lightning of Rage vs. Friends
 What the hell is that giant  boulder-looking thing?
 What is that?
 What's going on?
 All right, I guess I'll go have some fun.
 The town...
 It's being attacked?
 We're heading into town, Vanessa!
 Right.
 G-Get on your own damn broom!
 This is no time to be bashful! Get going!
 I-I'm not bashful!
 Damn it... H-Hang on tight!
 Full speed ahead, Crazy Cyclone!
 Up ahead, I feel elven magic from  both the north and the south.
 Since there are two places, it'd be  better if we split up and helped them.
 Yuno!
 Asta!
 See you at the royal capital!
 Hey, now...
 We came to this town because  it was under attack, but...
 What the hell's going on here,
 Luck?!
 Why, you little...
 Luck!
 Damn it... Luck!
 What are you trying to do?!
 Luck?
 Oh, him...
 I think he wanted to see someone. Was it you two?
 Too bad, though.
 Because of the reincarnation spell,  this body belongs to me, Rufel, now.
 Reincarnation? Rufel?
 The hell are you babbling about?
 Forbidden magic?
 Huh?
 It means someone else  has taken over Luck's body!
 Someone else?
 Those Eye of the Midnight Sun guys?
 Probably.
 Luck and the other Royal Knights
 headed to the Eye of the  Midnight Sun's hideout.
 Then was that flying boulder thing their...
 It's their hideout.
 I guess the plan to eliminate them failed.
 Exactly! I guess you're  not as dumb as you look.
 Oh, by the way, those Royal Knights  or whatever were completely wiped out!
 So basically, if you guys are  also going to get in my way,
 you're gonna have to die, too!
 Wait a sec...
 I ended up attacking somewhere  completely different?
 Oh? Is this a spell to protect your friends?
 That's pretty interesting.
 What the hell do you think you're doing?!
 I'm gonna burn you to a crisp!
 Explosive Scatter—
 The red thread of fate...
 Rouge is on the side of all the Black Bulls.
 So she'll protect Luck, even though  his body is possessed right now.
 Shut down your damn cat's powers, Vanessa!
 What are you talking about?
 If Luck's attack had connected,  you would've died instantly.
 Besides, if it really is the forbidden  spell, Luck is just asleep, and...
 That's why I'm trying to  wake that fool back up!
 Take this! Flame Magic: Explosive Scattershot!
 Such a simple spell...
 There's no way it'll hit me.
 They disappeared?  But I still sense their mana.
 I call this ""Explosive  Annihilation Scattershot""!
 He's fast!
 There's no spell that can hit me.
 Which means you humans can't defeat me!
 Shut up!
 Now, then... Do you think  you can dodge my attacks?!
 Vanessa!
 Honestly, all of you people  are so overly enthusiastic!
 I'll back you up!
 I mean, if you actually  manage to defeat Luck,
 that might shock him enough to wake him up!
 No one asked you!
 Explosive Scatter...
 Show him the results of  all your training with me!
 That's exactly what I plan  on doing, you dumbass!
 Eat this!
 Again, that spell won't hit me.
 This is my newest Explosive Scattershot!
 I call it ""Time Bomb Explosive Scattershot""!
 Doesn't matter if it hits you  or not! It'll still explode!
 Think you can tell which ones will explode?!
 Your puny little spell isn't going to hit me!
 At least try to amuse me a little more!
 Whoa, there...
 Throwing fireballs that  don't disappear or explode?
 Is this supposed to be a feint?
 Or are you out of magic already?
 If he's dodging by sensing where mana is,
 Magna can get behind him by mixing  in some regular Scattershots!
 I'll be able to hit him at this distance!
 Too bad.
 I sensed your mana.
 I'm fully aware of your ability  to sense mana and your speed.
 He made sure it would explode right at this moment?
 You don't know, do you?
 That I'm stupid enough to  make myself explode, too!
 If you were actually Luck, you'd probably  figure that I'd do something so stupid!
 I'm way more skilled than you when it comes to
 resilience and being able to take a hit!
 Flame Magic: Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!
 And then... Flame Bondage Formation.
 I know Luck really well.
 I don't know who the hell you are,
 but you don't know a damn  thing about him or me!
 That's why you have no chance of beating me!
 If that's crystal clear, then hurry up  and return that idiot to us!
 You...
 That's...
 Who...
 can't beat whom,
 human?
 Why don't you explain just how  you humans expect to defeat me?
 Bring it on! I'll keep throwing  these at you until Luck wakes up!
 He disappeared?
 Your attacks will never hit me again.
 He's moving so fast, I can't see him.
 Humans can't keep up with me!
 He was already a monster, but now...
 Where are you looking?
 And it's over!
 Where are you looking?
 Huh?
 Oh?
 The power to control... the future?  No, to control fate.
 But it appears you can't attack me.
 Not to mention, I'm pretty sure that  power uses quite a bit of magic.
 The magic of elves, who are blessed  by mana, or the magic of you humans...
 Which do you think will last longer?!
 Tired already?
 I haven't even broken a sweat yet!
 That ended much more quickly than I'd hoped.
 The humans of the Clover Kingdom  will be destroyed.
 That's what you deserve, and that's the  fate we elves shall bring upon you!
 Shut... up...
 Yeah...
 I don't care if you're an elf or not.
 I'm not talking to you.
 I'm talking to that idiot...
 So you can hurry up and get the  hell out of that body, dumbass!
 He's a mischievous little brat who's always  being reckless and causing us trouble...
 But Luck is my little brother!
 Give him back right now!
 You humans betray each  other at the drop of a hat.
 Are you trying to tell me  you actually have a bond?
 Don't make me laugh!
 Nothing you can do will break  this reincarnation spell!
 Especially not your flimsy little bond!
 This human's soul has already been destroyed!
 Is that so? In that case...
 Why the hell are you crying?
 Acting like someone you're not...
 I know you're still in there, Luck!
 While you were off messing around,
 I was out training and got  super strong, you dumbass!
 If that pisses you off, then get the  hell out here and fight me already!
 Shut...
 Luck, don't you dare think you  can get rid of us that easily!
 My red thread of fate is  never going to let you go!
 So hurry up and come back!
 Shut up.
 Luck!
 Shut up! Shut up!
 Luck!
 Shut up!
 Shut up, human!
 Luck!
 Like I'm ever...
 going to shut up!
 Rouge used up the last of her magic...
 to bring upon the fate that  would bring Asta here!
 Who the hell are you?
 You know damn well who I am!
 But I'll repeat myself as  many times as it takes!
 We're Luck's friends!
 Asta...
 Asta...
 Friends, eh? You're all  really getting on my nerves.
 You don't have a lick of magic, do you?
 I never thought anyone in this world  could be so unloved by mana.
 And the first ones to ever acknowledge  me and consider me one of their own
 were the Black Bulls!
 I won't let you take a single one of them!
 It doesn't matter who or what you are.
 You'll never be able to see my movements!
 You can die at the hands  of your precious friend!
 There's no way a human can  keep up with this speed!
 How are you able to keep up?
 Your ki is filled with rage that makes it super easy to read!
 And this sword is sensitive
 to really powerful magic,  and will seek it wherever it goes!
 You're so annoying!
 Not bad.
 But...
 Like you could actually surpass my rage!
 He shouldn't be able to detect me,  but his combat sense is insane!
 Magna! Miz Vanessa!
 I need you guys to back me up!
 You got it!
 You really think these attacks  are going to hit me now?
 And...
 I've figured out how fast you are by now!
 Asta!
 My body can't hold out much longer...  I need to make the next one count!
 This is the end, human!
 Since he's got no magic, their plan is just to hide him?
 In that case...
 I'll spread out my mana
 and detect the moment your  sword makes my mana disappear.
 There he is.
 He's heading straight for me.
 I've got him!
 My rage is stronger!
 You're there!
 There!
 There!
 Huh?
 They used that thread to throw off my timing?
 Go!
 Asta!
 Our feelings are tougher than you!
 All right!
 I'll free you now!
 He's still got all this power left?
 You're the ones who are going to die, humans!
 Give it up already, damn it!
 We told you! We're not  letting go, no matter what!
 Don't...
 Don't touch me!
 Luck, you're my precious little brother!
 Hurry up and come back so you can tease Magna
 and eat other people's puddings without asking!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout  was heading toward the royal capital.
 All right, I guess I'll go have some fun.
 Luck had reincarnated as an elf and  was possessed by a thirst for revenge.
 He landed in a town on  the way to the royal capital
 and ruthlessly attacked the humans there.
 Hey, now...
 We came to this town because  it was under attack, but...
 What the hell's going on here,
 Luck?!
 Magna and Vanessa rushed to the scene.
 Though they were bewildered by Luck's changed personality,
 they still engaged him in battle.
 Flame Magic: Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!
 I don't know who the hell you are,
 but you don't know a damn  thing about him or me!
 That's why you have no chance of beating me!

 But that just seemed to  make him resist even more.
 The humans of the Clover Kingdom  will be destroyed.

 Magna faced a life-or-death situation!
 And then...
 Like I'm ever...
 going to shut up!
 Who the hell are you?
 We're Luck's friends!

 There he is.

 Don't...
 Don't touch me!
 Huh?
 I thought I could just barely hear  a voice until a moment ago...
 Wake up, Luck!
 If you don't like it,  wake up and fight me already!
 I'm never letting you go,  so hurry up and come back!
 Who is that? What's going on?
 Luck...
 Mom!
 Come over here, Luck.
 You're not normal.  You have to stay by my side.
 That's right... The only person  who could ever love me is my mom.
 I live for my mom...
 To make her smile.
 I'm going to unleash all my magic!  Then all of you, this human,
 and I will all be done for!
 Disappear! Disappear! Die, humans!
 What the hell is this ki?!
 Is this actually magic?
 Something dark and black is welling up!
 H-Hey, damn it!
 It's just like him...
 At this rate, Luck will become...
 something besides an elf... something evil!
 All of them...
 Everyone precious to me...
 You took them all from me!
 Humans... I will make you pay!
 I don't know what the  heck you're talking about,
 but if we humans really  are at fault, I'm sorry.
 I'm really sorry!
 But for us... Luck is our precious friend!
 So please... Don't take him from us!
 Please!
 Give him back to us!
 And I'm pretty sure all those  people who are important to you
 wouldn't want you to be like this!

 I'm sorry, Mom. I have to go.
 Despite what I am, I found something important to me.

 Thank you for everything.

 Aw, who's this little cutie?  You can think of me as your big sis.
 It's a pleasure to meet you, my new friend.
 Try this. La? La?
 This is my little sister Marie.
 Isn't she an angel? A goddess?
 I will allow you to revere her.
 I don't care what you think about me!
 Think whatever you want! And I'm going  to think of you as my... as our friend!
 Ugh. Talk about a crazy senior.
 But I'm royalty, so I guess I'll forgive you.
 The ones who are going to fight in the  finals aren't you and that Yuno guy!
 It's going to be me and Luck!
 I also...
 I believe that this will become
 a world where our peoples can  live side by side as friends.
 We'll be able to understand each other.
 I also... wanted to become  friends with humans like you.
 I...
 I'm...
 still one of the Black Bulls, right?
 Of course you are, you dumbass.
 Magna! Vanessa! Asta!
 Thank you!
 Why?!
 Why? He's obviously trying to hide his  embarrassment, you virgin delinquent.
 Look at you, hugging him like that!
 You're such a man's man, Magna!
 You dumb— That's not— Don't make me clobber you guys!
 Aw, look at you, all embarrassed.
 I'm not, damn it!
 You should be more honest with yourself.
 Look who's talking!
 But really, thanks, guys.
 But I...
 sorta destroyed the town.
 That's not exactly anything new.
 Are all the people who live here okay?
 I made sure to save them. Don't you worry.
 Oh, good. Thanks, Vanessa.
 I didn't even have the chance...
 Stupid Magna.
 The hell did you just say?!
 Explosive...
 I'm outta magic...
 Anyway, Asta!
 By the way, Asta!
 Yes?!
 What the hell is that sword?!
 Th-This?
 It turned Luck back to normal, didn't it?
 According to Yuno, it, uh,  it takes magical effects...
 Er, it basically sucks out the spell,
 as if it was never cast, or something...
 What the heck does that mean?
 I'm not really sure,  and it takes more than one hit,
 but if I have a little bit of time,  I can undo the reincarnation spell!
 That's awesome!
 But I realized this just a moment ago.
 Those elf guys weren't actually  bad to begin with.
 Since he disappeared from Luck, though, does that mean he died again?
 But he was smiling in the end.
 That gentle person is who he really was.
 I think it's good that you freed him.
 The reincarnation spell  is really scary and sad.
 I see... In that case,  for both the humans and elves...
 I need to save everyone else with this sword!
 Yeah!
 Huh? Everyone else?
 A bunch of people who reincarnated as elves are wreaking havoc all over the kingdom!
 Huh?
 What?! That's an emergency!
 So those lights that went up into  the sky were the reincarnation...
 There were a lot in the royal capital!
 That giant boulder thing was also  heading toward the royal capital.
 We should go, too. We have to  protect the Clover Kingdom!
 Yes, but before that,  we should head back to our base
 and regroup with everyone else.
 Yeah!
 Leave that to me!
 My body remembers the feeling of the mana when that elf kid was with me.
 I can get even stronger!
 What?! Then I'm just gonna get even stronger!
 Want me to train you next time, Magna?
 Piss off, you dumbass!
 We're almost back at the base.
 The base...
 What the hell happened?
 Was it attacked by elves?
 Asta!
 Wait... Oh, it's just you guys.
 The magical beasts that the captain keeps?
 Thank goodness you're safe.  Say, where are the others?
 Over there?
 Guys!
 Guys!
 Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble...
 I'm so embarrassed!
 They're okay! But they're  not making any sense!
 And... after... that...
 Who the hell is that?
 Guys! This is no time to  be mumbling and stuttering!
 A-Asta!
 Luck! Vanessa! Magna!
 I'm so glad you're safe, my dear friends!
 Wow! What the heck happened here?
 And who the hell are you?
 Magna...
 You know who I am?
 Who the hell—
 If... you... get... too... close...  your... magic... will... get...
 The hell is this?! The little bit of  mana I have left is being sucked away?!
 Is he an enemy?!
 He's not an enemy, Magna!
 Asta...
 He's one of members who's  been here the longest!
 He has a weird disease that sucks  away magic, and he's the owner
 of the Black Bulls' base! It's Henry!
 Huh?
 Owner?
 I don't have any magic, so I'm totally fine.
 He'd come visit me all the time.
 Though I seriously thought  he was a ghost at first.
 Asta... is... such... a... good... boy.
 Wait, so you guys really  didn't know about Henry?
 I totally thought you knew him.
 Someone this weird was  still hiding in our base?
 There isn't anyone else  living there, is there?
 So what the hell happened?
 Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble...
 Um... Um...
 Well... you... see...
 I have no idea what the  hell any of you are saying!
 Oh, no...
 Gauche...
 turned into an elf?!
 I know this is a serious moment,  but how could you even understand that?!
 Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble...
 I know, right?! But someone  else is inside, so don't worry!
 He doesn't actually hate you!
 Um... Um...
 Yeah! I think so, too!
 The fact that Gauche didn't finish you  off means his body's fighting back!
 And... then...
 Gauche headed toward the  royal capital, didn't he?
 How are you even communicating?!
 We have to go save Gauche, too.
 But I'm out of magic...
 You guys get some rest!
 Asta and I will go!
 Wait for us, Gauche!
 What the heck is that sound? It's literally shaking the ground.
 And this overwhelming amount of magic...
 I won't forgive you... I won't forgive you...
 Charmy!
 Don't tell me...
 Who was it?!
 Don't tell me even Miz Charmy...
 has turned into an elf!
 Who the heck destroyed the vegetable  garden I had behind the base?!
 She's not an elf!
 Thank goodness!
 I put so much effort into that garden, la!
 I watered it, gave it fertilizer,  and put oh-so much love into it!
 I wanted to find a bunch of yummy  things and feed them to you guys,
 so I rushed back even though  I was starving, and then...
 This is what I find!
 That creepy sound was  just her tummy rumbling?!
 Sauce isn't enough to satisfy my hunger, la!
 That was sauce?!
 Are you the ones who wrecked my garden?!
 Uh, er, no... It wasn't us.
 You've got the wrong people.
 Who did it, then?!
 Um... I think it was the Eye of  the Midnight Sun and some elves...
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun?
 Elves?
 I'm gonna go kick their asses!
 All of you, follow me!
 Uh, er, I'm out of magic, so I can't...
 I also barely have any left...
 La? You're out of magic?
 Yes...
 Then I'll just have to do this!
 Cotton Creation Magic...
 Sheep Cook: Head Chef!
 Why?!
 All of you...
 Get to work!
 Why, though?!
 Wait! We don't have time for this!
 We have to hurry to the royal capital!
 Eat.
 Seriously, why?!
 Eat!
 Well, I guess I am a little hungry...
 Th-Thanks!
 Stare...
 It's good! It's so good!
 Nothing beats a meal with your best friends!
 I-It's really good!
 Th-This is...
 I can feel my magic increasing!
 The Head Chef's cooking increases your magic,  depending on how much you eat!
 There it is again! This super insane magic!
 But well done, Charmy!
 You're amazing, Miz Charmy!
 Now we can all head to the royal capital!
 Eat! Eat up! Chow it all down!
 But make sure you savor the flavor!
 Will this maybe give me magic, too?!
 Zero still means zero! But eat up anyway!
 I'm going to eat away my sorrows!
 You should have some, too, Henry!
 But... I'll... end... up... sucking...  away... everyone's... magic.
 It's fine! We just have to eat more, then!
 Look who's talking! My precious  little bit of magic left...
 It... tastes... so... good.
 Klaus and Rill turned into elves!  And that fat guy from the Golden Dawn, too!
 The captain said he was heading  to the Golden Dawn's base!
 I'm sure Mister Yami's fine!
 I'm so blessed to be able to eat  a meal with my bestest friends!
 Finral's still in the hospital.  Where's Noelle?
 Heading to the royal capital  with her brother with the bangs,
 the Captain of the Silver Eagles!
 We have to hurry after them!
 They should be with another guy named Zora  who's randomly with the Black Bulls!
 What?! He's a Black Bull?!
 Yeah!
 Come on, Grey! Eat up!
 I will!
 This is getting really fun!
 These are the Black Bulls I know.
 Good, good! Keep on chowing down!
 And being among them is extra special.
 The hell is that?!
 That's amazing!
 That's the power of our new best friend!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 I'm going to unleash all my magic!  Then all of you, this human,
 and I will all be done for!
 Disappear! Disappear! Die, humans!
 What the hell is this ki?!
 Asta, Magna, and Vanessa fought Luck,  who had reincarnated as an elf.
 Humans... I will make you pay!
 I don't know what the  heck you're talking about,
 but if we humans really  are at fault, I'm sorry.
 I'm really sorry!
 But for us... Luck is our precious friend!
 So please... Don't take him from us!
 Please!
 Give him back to us!
 And I'm pretty sure all those  people who are important to you
 wouldn't want you to be like this!
 Luck!
 Their feelings for Luck
 and Luck's feelings for the  Black Bulls connected, and then...
 I...
 I'm...
 still one of the Black Bulls, right?
 Of course you are, you dumbass.
 Path of Revenge, Path of Atonement
 Go!
 Asta, Magna, Vanessa, and Luck
 reunited with the other Black Bulls:  Gordon, Grey, Henry, and Charmy.
 Aboard the Raging Black Bull,
 they raced full speed ahead  for the royal capital.
 I sense them.
 There are three elves in the town up ahead.
 The Greatest City in the Common Realm Hecairo
 Member of the Blue Rose Knights Risakka Ondell
 That was pathetic.
 A shame, considering how  glorious this town is.
 Vice Captain of the Purple Orcas  Xerx Lügner
 But even that is a mere  shadow of what it once was.
 Member of the Coral Peacocks Protobe Collina
 They're just about finished.
 Mom! Dad!
 I-It's no use... They're too powerful.
 Lord Xerx...
 Why is the Saint of Pure Ice attacking  the people he's supposed to protect?
 Magic Knights doing something like this...
 Is the Clover Kingdom finally finished?
 Sol, I'm sorry... I couldn't  protect everyone.
 But I won't give up until the very end!
 I'm going to purify everything now.
 Including you filthy humans.
 Ice Magic...
 What's the matter?
 Something's charging this way.
 What is that? An enemy?
 The humans can resist all they want.
 Whatever it may be, it shall not pass.

 I... totally... know... everything...
 Holy crap! That was so powerful! Damn!

 You guys are so awesome! The coolest!
 I'm so happy. I finally get  to fight alongside everyone.
 Let's go, everyone!
 Let's go, Henry!
 That's enough foolishness  from you humans!
 You may be able to dodge this...
 But this town will be blown away.
 Take this! Combo Magic...
 Asta Cannon!
 Heck yeah!
 The Black Bulls are invincible!
 For as long as I could remember, I felt it.
 There was someone sleeping inside me.
 It felt as though they were terribly hurt,
 terribly angry,
 and terribly sad.
 Because I felt that I needed  to protect this weak being...
 Because I knew that this  wasn't just my body...
 Because I felt as though I wasn't alone...
 I was able to survive my  painful and lonely childhood.
 Around the time I turned nine,  I started to have the same dream...
 Of days filled with happiness.
 They were your past memories.
 And then an ending of disloyalty...  despair... and hatred.
 I believed it was my duty to protect you.
 And then, when I was thirteen...
 I met Lord Julius.
 William! Join the Magic Knights!
 He was rather strange, but he was  the first person to acknowledge me.
 Oh, but I guess you haven't  received your grimoire yet.
 In that case, I'll keep dropping by until  you turn fifteen and get your grimoire.
 He was a kind and great person.
 I'm sure you'll become a  magnificent Magic Knight.
 When I was sixteen, you awakened.
 Where am I?
 Didn't I die?
 Around that time, I was working  as a newcomer in the Gray Deer,
 which was led by Lord Julius.
 Because you had received  a grimoire as well,
 I confirmed the fact that we  were two souls sharing one body.
 We were eventually able to share  our thoughts through our souls,
 and we could even swap souls.
 You had a mission that you  had to complete at all costs.
 And that was going to make  me betray the other person
 who was most important to me,  as well as my kingdom.
 You, the person I had shared my life  and body with as if we were twins,
 or the person who stood at the top of
 the Magic Knights and showed  me how to live my life...
 I was conflicted over who I should choose.
 I took both sides as I hurt my comrades.
 In the end, I couldn't completely choose a side
 and let the two of them decide the outcome.
 I'm the worst.
 And you won.
 I'm so sorry, Lord Julius.
 Congratulations, Patry.
 And since your wish came true,
 this is where we say goodbye.
 Goodbye, Patry.
 If possible, I...
 Did I fall asleep after  using too much of my power?
 My incomplete reincarnation  is also now complete.
 William has now fallen into  a deep, endless sleep.
 Thank you, my one and only human friend.
 William... Goodbye.
 Now there is no longer any human I cannot kill.
 Licht should be heading to the  royal capital along with Raia.
 I must hurry, too.
 Clover Castle... The center of  the humans' foolish bigotry...
 It's where the royalty,  our most hated enemies, live,
 and where we shall exact our revenge.
 In the moment of reincarnation,  the fear for his life,
 immense hatred, and anger
 made Rades's magic, which could only  control the dead up until that point, grow.
 This was the perfection of true wraith magic.
 This evolved magic was just barely  able to return the souls
 that were about to be sacrificed  for reincarnation to their bodies.
 Licht!
 How dare you trick me,  use me, and then kill me?!
 You'll pay for this! You'll pay for  this if it's the last thing I do!
 Right, guys?!
 Valtos!
 Sally!
 You got lucky. You two just barely made it.
 We're going to kill him together.
 Heck yeah!
 All three of them have been freed!
 Heck yeah!
 Spatial magic?
 You guys...
 What are you doing here?
 Heya, Black Bulls.
 I'm gonna use you guys to get my revenge.
 Th-The Eye of the...
 They attacked our base.
 Are you the ones who destroyed my  vegetable garden back at the base?!
 Those who waste food shall pay, la!
 Shut up!
 You guys piss me off, too, but right now,  I want to kill that bastard Licht.
 Huh?
 He tricked me, tricked us,  used us however he wanted,
 and then sacrificed us for his own goals.
 He's going to pay for this...
 No matter what, if it's the last thing I do!
 Licht is heading to the royal capital.
 He's probably there by now.
 If we power up Valtos's spatial magic  with Sally's Dark Magic Items,
 we'll be able to transport  this moving base of yours.
 We'd be in the royal capital in an instant.
 You guys want to hurry to the  royal capital, too, don't you? Right?
 Then we have the same goal.
 Lend me your strength.
 Not a bad deal, right?
 I'll kill you, I'll kill you...
 I'll kill you, Licht!
 Judging from the mana, it feels like all  the elves are heading to the royal capital.
 But isn't it too convenient that you  just suddenly showed up to ask for help?
 I see you're going to coopera—
 You're so annoying!
 What?!
 Wh-What the hell are you doing?!
 We have the same goal?!  It's not the same at all!
 Wha?
 We're fighting to protect!
 We're not helping anyone  for the sake of revenge!
 More importantly...
 You're the guy who attacked all those  innocent people at the royal capital before!
 And now you want revenge?  You can't be serious!
 ""Revenge,"" my ass, you stupid jerk!
 First, you need to atone for everything!
 From now on, you're going  to help save the kingdom!
 Huh?! You can't be serious, you bastard!
 I'm totally serious!
 With that, we're in a hurry to get to  the royal capital, so thanks for your help!
 Huh?! Who died and made you the boss?!
 This deal is null and void! Null and void!
 You're not getting away!  You're gonna help us now!
 Why are you so strong, damn it?!
 That's so Asta.
 Hell yeah, Asta! You get him!
 But hey, if we're just heading to the  royal capital, do we really need that guy?
 Oh, good point.
 Huh?!
 Luck's exactly right. I'll just  make a deal with these two.
 You bastard!
 Hey! What do you think about all this?
 I...
 I just want to see Master Licht  again and find out the truth.
 I'll help you for that reason.
 If Master Licht's words were nothing but lies,
 then I am nothing more than a sinner.
 Seeking atonement might be good for me.
 Valtos, you jerk!
 S-Sally! You want revenge, too, don't you?!
 I don't have my glasses, so I can't see too well.
 Who cares about your glasses right now?!
 I was only with Master Licht because he  let me do all the experiments I wanted.
 The Magic Knights always get in my way.
 But I guess I'm happy that I'm  alive again and can do my research.
 I saw a whole bunch of stuff when I was dying,
 so I think I'm about to have  some kind of breakthrough!
 You're only alive again because of me, Sally!
 Yeah, I guess. Thanks, Rades.
 You wanted to examine my body, right?!
 If you help us out and this battle ends,  you can examine me all you want!
 Huh?
 Really, Asta?! Yay!
 On one condition.  Nothing that hurts really bad!
 Aw...
 Don't ""Aw..."" me!
 You can do all the experiments  and research you want,
 as long as you don't harm or bother anyone!
 Actually, if you did research  that'd help everyone out,
 we'd all be happy to help!
 That'd make you happy, too, right?
 I don't really get it,
 but if that'll let me do more research,  I guess I'll do that.
 Yeah, you should!
 You don't need any anesthesia  when I cut you apart, right?
 Yes, I do!
 You can't be serious, Sally!
 I'm the one who brought you back to life!
 Did you have enough time to reflect?
 Eat up. You're nothing but skin and bones.
 La? La?
 Th-This is... My magic is recovering.
 What?! That's amazing!
 I'm starving! Gimme, please!
 No one can fight on an empty stomach!
 Eat up!
 It's so yummy! I want to dissect  something even more now!
 Make sure you use anesthesia, okay?!
 Y-You jerks...
 Well? Feel like saving the kingdom yet?
 Go on... You know you're hungry.
 La?
 It's so good. My magic's recovering.
 And I feel more energetic.  Nothing beats eating with friends!
 I can't imagine why you wouldn't  want to eat something so yummy.
 This is so good! So fricking good!
 Yeah! I feel totally motivated now.
 De...li...cious.
 I'm so happy I'm alive.
 Oh, wait, you were dead up until a while ago?
 The only reason I'm able to eat  yummy things is because I'm alive!
 Right?
 Fine!
 I'll go to the royal capital with you!
 But I'm not gonna do whatever you want me to!
 I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want!
 You're supposed to ask us to take you with us!
 Too bad! You're gonna  save the kingdom with us!
 Shut up!
 Go on, eat up! There's plenty  more where that came from, la!
 Come on! Hurry up and eat so  you can get back on your feet!
 Recover all your magic, and let's  head to the royal capital!

 The Battle for Clover Castle
 Kira Residence – Central Tower
 So what's the meaning of this, Vaude?
 King of the Clover Kingdom Augustus Kira Clover XIII
 I hear that your son,  who engaged in violent acts
 at my Royal Knights Selection Exam,
 is now under suspicion of treason.
 Your Majesty, there must be  some kind of mistake!
 Ledior Vaude
 There's no way someone from the  House of Vaude would do such a thing!
 Th-That's right! My little Langris  could never be a traitor!
 Liliane Vaude
 Regardless, I cannot allow  someone of my bloodline
 to marry someone with a reputation like that.
 Great Uncle...
 Finnes Calmreich
 I'm not troubled by Lord Langris.
 Please be lenient with him.
 Finnes, this matter does not concern you!
 And you should be ashamed that Finnes  is even trying to protect you!
 This is Lady Finnes, the fiancée of  the next head of the House of Vaude.
 Good day to you.
 Your Majesty, I have an urgent report!
 It's regarding the mage attacks...
 Silence!
 I'm sure the Magic Knights  have gathered by now!
 They can do whatever they  want until I get over there!
 What are so many members of  the Golden Dawn doing here?
 This area is protected by us,  the Castle Knights.
 You need to hurry and go help the citizens.
 We have business with the  humans beyond that door.
 What kind of sick joke is  that at a time like this?
 The castles where the three great royal  families live lie beyond this gate.
 Even Magic Knights may not  enter without permission.
 That's just a stupid rule  that you humans made up.
 Wh-What are you...
 Like I care about it.
 This is treason! Capture them!
 Compass Magic: Willful Compass.
 D-Do not falter!
 I'll leave the rest to you.
 Understood.
 My group will go right.
 Then we'll go left.
 I'll continue straight forward  and rip them apart!
 Hey, wait!
 You're the ones who will wait, humans.
 So that hole in the castle  gate really was Langris!
 I could honestly care less about  the royals, but this ki...
 Looks like a bunch of pretty tough  characters got into the castle.
 We'll have to let the other guys handle  the town. We're going in, Finral!
 Yes, sir!
 Yami!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked  Lightless Blunt Strike!
 All of these guys are  brimming with magical power!
 And there are, like, dozens of them!
 This is terribad!
 You aren't going to try to kill us? How naïve.
 Nah, I have plenty of reasons to kill you.
 At least, the you that had the nerve to  take that body, as if it belongs to you.
 Such nonsense!
 Dark Magic: Black Hole!
 In the end, there are four of them.  This is going to be tough.
 It doesn't matter how many of you  humans try and attack us! You cannot wi—
 This crazy magic is...
 Damn it, you stupid bastards!  Getting your bodies taken over...
 Talk about entertainment!
 Captain of the Green Praying Mantises Jack the Ripper
 Of course the ones who  are most worth slicing up
 would show up at the castle, huh?
 The Captain of the Green Praying Mantises,  Jack the Ripper!
 Geh. Did our reinforcements  really have to be this weirdo?
 What? You wanna get sliced open first, Yami?
 Actually, you already almost got me.
 Welp, I'm glad you didn't turn  on us, you giant string bean!
 Who'd get taken over with this much  fun to be had, you stupid meathead?!
 We won't let any of you leave alive, humans!
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe!
 Corundum Magic: Ideal Closer!
 You won't be able to cut  through my magic with that.
 Death Scythe!
 I told you, it's useless.
 Your moves are totally obvious.
 This is such a pain in the ass.
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Blade Storm!
 It's taking all I have to read  their ki and dodge their attacks.
 Watch what you're doing,  you giant string bean!
 Death Scythe! Death Scythe!
 I'm getting excited!
 The crazy dude's being even crazier than usual.
 Two captains are struggling this much?
 Hey, you get it by now, don't you, you giant string bean weirdo?
 Hell yeah, I do.
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe!
 Your magic won't work on m—
 There's nothing I can't sever.
 All right, now show me  you're worth slashing apart!
 Impossible... The property  of the magic itself changed?
 Found someone who let down his guard.
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked  Lightless Blunt Strike!
 I think you're starting to see it, too...
 Finral!
 Yes, sir!
 Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!
 What?
 Heck yeah! Great job, you two!
 Looks like you're finally  starting to get it, Finral.
 You've got some skill if you can  support me in combat, you bastard.
 Th-Thanks...
 Holy crap, he's scary!
 Hey, he's my ride.
 He's terrifying, too!
 Don't be stingy.  Let me borrow him sometime.
 Like hell I will, string bean man.
 C-Come on, you two... We have to hurry.
 That's—
 Silva Residence
 What in the world are you doing, Golden Dawn?!
 You Magic Knights exist to protect  those of us in the upper classes!
 Why?! What's going on?
 This is the royal palace!
 We'd only gather here to curry  favor with the House of Silva,
 to see if they'd grant us  a share of their power.
 Why in the world is this happening?!
 Be my shield, you common servant!
 You lower classes only exist for us—
 No!
 There's no point in seeking out a decoy.
 My needles will only pierce  their intended targets.
 They'll pursue you, no matter how  far you go, until they hit you.
 Of course, we're killing all the humans  anyway, so I guess that didn't matter much.
 Damn it... Damn it!
 I can't quell my rage!
 You lost to Noelle? How pathetic, Solid.
 I'm sure you just let your guard down.
 You can't be serious!  Noelle couldn't cast a spell like that!
 Solid...
 It's all right if I hit you, right?
 Just go ahead and try it!
 You complete failure!
 Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Curse that Noelle!
 I'll make her pay for this!
 What's this presence I sense?
 I feel a bit uneasy.
 A Golden Dawn member?
 Do you know where you are?!
 What do you think you're doing?!
 This magical power... You must be royals.
 Descendants of that tainted bloodline...
 I've come to kill you.
 This immense power...
 It looks like we need to  teach you some manners.
 Mist Magic: Solid Mist Clones!
 I guess I'll play with you for a bit.
 Mist Spider's Threads!
 You can taste how powerful  a royal's magic is yourself!
 The lowly shall always be lowly.
 Compass Magic: Useless North.
 Impossible...
 She was able to find my location  without even trying to hit my clones?
 What an underhanded spell.  It's perfect for you humans.
 Nebra!
 How dare you?! Don't think you're  going to get away with this!
 Oh? You're royalty, but you can't tell?
 What? I sense an even more  immense power outside.
 You humans are about to be destroyed.
 There's something crazy in there!
 Looks like this is gonna  be even more fun now.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
 There's absolutely nothing fun  about this! Not in the least!
 That's probably the enemy's hideout,  isn't it? That's super bad!
 Why are there even more crazy enemies now?!
 Damn it...
 Who the hell invited that giant rock?
 But look. A pretty little  bird just showed up, too.
 We will not let the castle fall,  no matter what.
 Welcome home, royals.
 Hey, Noelle!
 That's... Captain Yami?
 Over here!
 I'm with Captain Yami! Do you see me?
 And... Finral?!
 And Captain Jack...
 I'm so sorry to make you worry, Noelle!
 I'm sure it was rough without me around—
 You've got at least a hundred years
 before I start worrying  about you, wimpy Finral!
 Wimpy
 You'd better start making up for all  that carefree sleep you got to have!
 Carefree
 Honestly...
 Jeez... I'm so glad he's okay!
 Were you waiting
 in anticipation for my beautiful  self to make my beautiful entrance?
 Brother, that's just painful...
 That's...
 It's been a while, Psycho Captain.
 I finally joined the Magic Knights,  since the rest of you are all so damn useless.
 Wait, who are you again?
 Quit messing with me!
 I'm a member of your squad!  The one that's filled with troublemakers!
 You'd better take responsibility  for giving me this robe,
 you random-ass captain!
 Took you long enough, dumbass.
 How long were you going to make me wait?
 You better work hard to make  up for being so late, Zora!
 So, where the hell have  you been, Captain Royalty?
 Your house is a huge mess right now.
 If you waste too much time,  we're gonna beat you into the castle!
 Foreigners and former commoners...
 Fear not. You're one of the few  that I actually consider beautiful.
 And you can shut your mouth.
 We're gonna go to the king,
 so you guys can figure out what  to do about your house!
 The enemy's powerful. Don't try  to take them down recklessly.
 Your only goal is to rescue and retreat!
 Who the hell died and  made you the boss, Yami?!
 None of you bastards better die, got it?!
 You're the last person  I need to hear that from.
 My home... I never thought I'd come back to it under these circumstances.
 This is so cruel.
 How dare they taint our castle like this?
 They will pay for this.
 Hup!
 Just a reminder that I don't  give a shit about you royals.
 I'm gonna do whatever I want.
 We've gotta move smart,  given the number of enemies we have.
 Hey! Who said you could leave?
 Leave him be.
 He was selected to be a Royal Knight.
 I'm sure he has his own way of fighting.
 Here they come.
 There you are, royals!
 I shall mete out your punishment!
 To think you'd lose your  composure in front of me...
 Using fine mana control to use
 free-transforming mercury magic  for both attack and defense...
 Nozel is truly amazing.
 Mother...
 We're going to take down  the strongest first!
 That's—
 Her stupidly huge magical powers are  getting in the way! I can't hit her!
 This... This can't be happening!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Serpent's Coils!
 Damn it... Damn it, damn it, damn it!
 Solid...
 I'm royalty, damn it!
 How pathetic.
 You can die now.
 Damn it!
 Nozel!
 Noelle!
 Mana Skin!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 I've got her!
 Compass Magic: Willful Compass!
 She deflected it!
 Noelle managed to get a spell  through the enemy's mana?!
 Nozel... Thank you... very much.
 Noelle managed to cast that incredible spell?
 But that didn't work, either.
 I hate to admit it, but I'd  just hold them back right now.
 I should probably retreat.
 Mist Magic: Bewildering Forest of Mist!
 I won't let any of you get away.
 Compass Magic: Another Atlas!
 You won't be able to escape this  place unless you defeat me!
 This is...
 I can't control my magic!
 This spell forcibly disturbs  the mana in this area.
 No matter how powerful your magic,   your spells won't hit me now.
 However...
 My spells won't fail to hit you.
 Nozel!
 Calm down.
 You can no longer fight.
 Worry about your own—
 It's okay... It's okay...
 I did all that training.
 I can do this... I can do this!
 I can still fight!
 Come, Noelle. Let's show her the true power
 of the royal House of Silva!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Jack the Amazing (Rippa)
 Jack the Amazing (Rippa).
 There's nothing I can't sever.
 All right, now show me  you're worth slashing apart!
 So with these... you gotta  cut them just the right size.
 Death Scythe.
 All right, now show me  you're worth slashing apart!
 So for this, you gotta dice it all up.  Dicing things up is great.
 Gotta love how that sounds.
 Death Scythe.
 All right, now show me  you're worth slashing apart!
 They said bite-size, but isn't that pretty  big when you're considering my mouth?
 Death Scythe.
 You need to make sure it doesn't  boil over once you put the miso in.
 It's done!
 Look at this amazing pork miso soup!
 I forgot the dashi! Damn it!
 There was once a warrior called  the Steel Warrior Princess.
 She would dance across the battlefield.
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 108: ""Battlefield Dancer.""

 Time has passed, and now Noelle Silva  will dance across the battlefield.

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Langris and the other  members of the Golden Dawn
 who had been reincarnated as  elves infiltrated the castle.
 Yami and Finral rushed to the castle  and were forced into a rough battle.
 It doesn't matter how many of you  humans try and attack us! You cannot wi—
 Of course the ones who  are most worth slicing up
 would show up at the castle, huh?
 Jack joined the battle, and they  were able to turn the tables.
 They regrouped with Nozel and the  others and rushed into the castle.
 Kivn had already infiltrated the Silvas' home,  where she attacked Nebra and Solid.
 Damn it!
 Nozel!
 Noelle!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Compass Magic: Another Atlas!
 Noelle and Nozel joined the fight,
 but they were also attacked  by Kivn's compass magic.
 Nozel!
 Calm down.
 You can no longer fight.
 Worry about your own—
 Battlefield Dancer
 Mother! Mother!
 At least realize you're being  attacked and evade, you slowpoke!
 You piece of trash!  How dare you eat before me?!
 If you're mad, just try to get me back.
 I'm sure it's hard to look in the  mirror with a face like yours.
 You should be grateful for my kindness.
 What's with that flimsy little grimoire?
 Are you really royalty?
 It's just pathetic that you can't  even control your powers.
 It disgusts me that you're my little sister.
 I will not have someone as shameful  as you in the Silver Eagles.
 Pathetic, isn't it?
 What, really?
 Noelle is practicing her water magic  against a dead tree by herself at night.
 Not only that, she keeps missing.
 A few even come back to hit her,  so she just gets soaked.
 I couldn't even do that as  a joke. She's so talented.
 Maybe she's even some kind of genius.
 I hate to think of her as my sister, though.
 Noelle, I've decided which Magic Knights  squad you'll be joining.
 You'll be joining the Black Bulls.  The matter has already been settled.
 What?
 The Black Bulls? You mean  the worst of the worst?
 That's perfect!
 Don't they just do lame missions out  in the boonies? Like hunting boars?
 That's perfect for you, Noelle.
 It's okay... It's okay...
 It's okay.
 I did all that training.
 I can do this... I can do this!
 I can still fight!
 Let's show her the true power
 of the royal House of Silva!
 Right!
 Unfortunately,
 your attacks will never reach  me in this sealed space.
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
 You're just wasting your magic. You're only going to exhaust yourself.
 And after all I went through to  try to let you die peacefully.
 What... What should I do?
 Even using Mana Skin, I can't use  Sea Dragon's Lair in this magical space.
 Even when I direct my magic with  all my strength, this is all I can do.
 All I can manage are simple  movements at close range.
 The only possible strategy is...
 You're trying very hard, but I  wonder how long you'll last.
 Nozel...
 Think. If Asta or the other  Black Bulls were here,
 they would think of something crazy...
 Damn it! If we don't break her spell,  we can't get out of here!
 There's no way out!
 No way out?
 I can't currently use creation  magic within this space,
 but I can intentionally cast  that rampaging spell!
 Nozel, please help me out!
 This is...
 What in the world is going on?
 Curse you...
 You flooded this enclosed  magical space with water.
 Another Atlas traps everything inside.
 I'm going to drown. I have no  choice but to undo the spell.
 How dare you, human...
 In a mere instant?!  Such speed and precision...
 That was amazing... I expected  that from Nozel, but Noelle...
 W-We did it, Nozel.
 Th-Thank you very much for going  along with my reckless plan.
 It was quite a crazy method of fighting,  unbefitting of royalty.
 But we were able to win because of it.
 So this is the method of fighting  that you've learned...
 Because you look just like our mother,  I feared I'd lose her again.
 Huh?
 I didn't think you would become strong.
 I couldn't lose you. I had to protect you.
 That's why I tried to keep  you off the battlefield.
 But you became strong.
 And that means I was mistaken.
 So, er...
 I-I apologize, Noelle.
 Nozel...
 ...apologized?
 N-Nozel...
 The fight is not yet over.
 We must treat Nebra at once.
 No...
 Nozel...
 Nozel! Nozel!
 Too bad for you.
 This mad world will not end.
 It's now even bigger and more powerful. It cannot be stopped.
 Damn it! What are we supposed to do?!
 There's nothing you can do.
 Give up, grieve, and regret  your actions, royals.
 I won't give up.
 There has to be...  There has to be some way!
 Think, Noelle!
 You can do this!
 After all, you were finally able  to get Nozel to acknowledge you!
 At this rate, Nozel and Nebra will...
 I can wait until you slowly weaken,
 but I think you'd prefer to die quickly,
 you foolish and sinful humans!
 I don't have a single good memory of them...
 But they're still my siblings!
 Long distance attacks won't hit.
 I can't do any complicated  magic manipulation.
 But if it's nearer and denser...
 This is a spell that I can cast only
 because of this situation  and who I am right now!
 The biggest factor in getting spells
 to manifest is natural talent.
 But dedicated training and unwavering  effort can also pay off.
 In some rare cases,  intense wishes or determination
 can grant power in a crisis, as well.
 Many royal mages acquire spells  intuitively using their innate,
 powerful magic and natural resourcefulness.
 And because of this ability,  they rarely ever research, train,
 or have their lives put in  danger on the battlefield.
 But while Noelle had an enormous  amount of magic as well as talent,
 as a member of the Black Bulls,  she trained, worked hard,
 and fought for her life.
 Everything she had gone through,
 and her strong desire to protect her siblings,
 gave her the power to get through this crisis!
 Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Armor!
 Noelle!
 What is this magic?
 A tremendous amount of magic  is being concentrated.
 Royal girl...
 It's like she's swimming  through this space.
 Is she riding mana from the magical attacks,  and the disturbance in this magical space,
 as if they were some sort of high waves?
 Is her armor a spell that lets her  control all the mana around her?
 But... will you be able to evade all of these?
 I still have the absolute advantage.
 If I find even the slightest  tear in your defense,
 this world will rip off your armor!
 It's hard to believe I was  struggling just a moment ago.
 I feel like I've been freed from my cage.
 I never knew magic was so freeing.
 I wonder if this is how Mother felt, too.
 Mother... The Dancing  Princess of the Battlefield...
 You managed to cut through  all of that attack?
 You're mine!
 Willful Compass!
 The mana currents you dance  through so elegantly...
 I'm going to change their destination,  as well as your own...
 To hell!
 Fall, royal!
 She overruled my mana compulsion?!
 Sorry, but I'm not dancing elegantly.
 This armor... Everything that  touches this mana...
 is under my control!
 I'm desperately struggling and fighting, forcing my way forward!
 Now be destroyed!  Both you and this mad world!
 Did I win?
 Hurry, take Nozel and Nebra...
 This isn't good. I don't have  enough magic to fight this many.
 How dare you do that to Kivn?
 It appears that we have  underestimated you humans.
 That will not happen again.
 Begone!
 Solid!
 Now that's what I call a  perfect surprise attack.
 Not bad. It's even more  insane when it's doubled.
 What was that spell?
 I've never seen anything like it.
 Don't let your guard down! Curse you, human!
 Considering the huge amounts of magic  you were throwing at each other,
 I figured a crowd would show up eventually.
 Zora!
 Go on, get to work,  you royal attendant jerk.
 House of Silva Attendant Paplo Espuma
 What are you thinking, bringing me  somewhere so dangerous?!
 I saved your ass, so now  you're gonna listen to me.
 No...
 More importantly, if you don't hurry up,  you won't have any masters anymore.
 Huh? Lady Nebra and Lord Nozel!
 O-Oh, no!
 Bubble Recovery Magic: Bubble Refresher!
 Lord Solid, please bring me Lord Nozel!
 Lord Solid?!
 What? You lost your will to fight?
 Give me a break, you royal Magic Knight.
 The other two got their asses kicked, too.
 All you do is flaunt your arrogance,  and this is all you've got? Pathetic.
 You can't even protect your own family,  you royal Magic Knights Squad captain?
 Nozel...
 You're finally receiving  your grimoire next year.
 I can't wait to see what kind  of magic you're going to learn.
 I'll learn spells of unparalleled power
 and become a powerful Magic Knights  Squad captain, just like you, Mother.
 Well... Nebra and Solid both have  water magic, just like your father.
 It's just a hunch, but I think  this little one will be the same.
 You're the only one who  inherited my steel attribute.
 Make sure you protect your  siblings with that magic, okay?
 That's right... I...
 You guys are supposed to be stronger  than the rest of us commoners, aren't you?
 Let's see just how brave you can be!
 Hey, that's enough out of y—
 It's all right.
 Nozel?
 He's exactly right.
 Groveling at something like this
 brings shame upon the royal House of Silva,
 as well as the title of  Captain of the Silver Eagles.
 I'll reinforce my physical  functions with magic.
 Nozel... I never knew mercury  magic could do that.
 It's such sophisticated magic!
 Let us go, Noelle.
 Yes, sir!
 All of you bastards have so  much magic, it makes me sick.
 I'm gonna need you to dial it  down to commoner level.
 Ash Magic: Revelation of the Cowardly.
 Here they come!
 Take my magic with you, Noelle!
 You won't escape!
 You're too slow!
 Hold still, damn it!
 You won't get away!
 Trap magic?
 I've rigged plenty for ya.
 The Revelation of the Cowardly reveals  where I've placed my trap spells.
 If they show even a moment of vulnerability,
 I'm sure those royals can take care of them!
 You can't move so easily with your  body in that condition, can you?!
 Nozel!
 He's ignoring the force of those spells?
 What was that spell?
 Considering your reactions,
 I guess you guys don't know about  complicated magic like counter-traps.
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Your control is faltering!
 Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver!
 This is nothing!
 These spells were derived and  developed over countless years.
 Complicated human spells...
 Looks like you elves don't know about them.
 Langris! No matter what you think of me,  I'll always be your older brother,
 and you're my younger brother!
 Come back, Langris!

 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The members of the Golden Dawn
 who had reincarnated as  elves attacked the castle.
 On top of that, the Eye of the  Midnight Sun's floating hideout arrived
 at the royal capital, carrying Licht and Raia.
 Who the hell invited that giant rock?
 But look. A pretty little  bird just showed up, too.
 Nozel and Noelle regrouped  with Yami and the others,
 then split off in order to protect  the people of the Clover Kingdom.
 But when Noelle and Nozel returned to the  Silva residence, where they had grown up,
 they were faced with the  enemy's compass magic.
 Noelle used the experience she  had gained in previous battles,
 as well as all the hours  she'd spent training,
 along with her desire to save her  siblings to gain new powers.
 Now be destroyed!  Both you and this mad world!

 Vermillion Residence
 No matter how many times we blow  this away, it comes right back.
 How dare those humans use  such impertinent spells?
 There are several enemies on the  third floor and in the inner courtyard.
 Which would mean the safest and most  beautiful escape route would be...
 Right there.
 Everyone, please hurry.
 Thank you, Mimosa and Kirsch.
 You've saved us.
 This is the Vermillion residence.
 The terrain is completely in our favor, and...
 My beautiful cherry blossom magic is helping
 to confuse the enemy while  protecting and hiding our allies.
 These shriveled little mushrooms  and their fungus magic weaken
 the enemy's magic and  their ability to find us.
 And finally, my dear sister  Mimosa is using her plant magic
 to search our residence  and guide us through it.
 If our goal is evacuation,  our spells are tailormade for it.
 We don't even have to worry about bloodshed.
 It's so beautiful!
 Please do shut up, Kirsch.
 They'll find us.
 They're only our enemies because  their bodies were taken over by elves.
 Members of the Golden Dawn,
 I promise you that we'll return you to normal.
 Heya. Working hard?
 David!
 Member of the Golden Dawn David Swallow
 Nope! I'm Baval.
 I didn't sense his presence at all.
 How did he find us?  Our spells aren't working?
 Oh, come on. Don't look so scary.
 I'm sorry to interrupt when  you were trying so hard,
 but all I did was find you and say hi.
 If I wanted to kill you,  you'd all be dead by now,
 so there's no point in getting all up in arms.
 What's with this elf?
 What are you after?
 Nothing, really.
 Let's relax and have a little chat.
 I think you know this, but we've reincarnated  with much more powerful magic than you
 and gathered here at the royals' residence.
 You can sense it, too, right?
 That there's powerful magic  other than ours heading here.
 Oh, it's pointless to escape outside.
 I mean, we're just going  to kill you all anyway.
 So just relax and give up.
 I'm pretty amazing, but so are the others.
 Man... This really takes me back.  I can't wait to see everyone.
 I won't let that happen!
 We won't give up!
 Well, that's fine and all, but I mean...
 This match seems like it'll be over  as soon as the enemy's king is taken.
 Kira Residence • Central Tower
 There's a really powerful guy  visiting your king right now.
 He's twisted, persistent, and stubborn,  so your king won't be able to escape.
 Oh, and...
 If our guy uses that magic to kill,  there's no way your king will survive.
 My magic isn't enough to offset that magic...
 He's that powerful?
 How dare you?! What do you think  you're doing in this sacred hall?!
 Wh-What's the matter, Langris?!
 That's the current king?  How seedy can a guy look?
 Seedy...
 How dare you call me seedy?!
 So your son is a traitorous rebel!
 Your Majesty, this is some kind of mistake!
 Y-Yes! My little Langris would  never do something so fooli—
 Silence!
 Honestly... How could they  let this scoundrel through?
 Julius and the other Magic Knights  are all absolutely useless!
 Very well, scoundrel!  I shall show you my magic!
 Behold my vast magical powers!
 You must be too busy shaking to even escape!
 Light Magic:
 Absolute Monarch of Divine Brilliance!
 How do you like that?! Behold my godlike spell!
 Now grovel before my authority!
 My...
 My spell!
 What a ridiculously slow light spell.
 I'm not going to kill you right away.
 I'll start with your legs!
 Stop!
 Langris!
 Please don't do this, Langris!
 If you don't stop now,
 both you and the people who care  for you are only going to be sad.
 Shut up.
 You killed all of us elves, and you have  the nerve to talk about being sad?
 Langris!
 Are you all right, Miss Finnes?
 Finral...
 Finral!
 Who the hell are you?
 I'm your older brother!
 Stop trying to act cool, Finral!
 I'm not, though!
 What are the others doing?
 We took care of all the other shiny guys.
 It would've gone more smoothly if  Mr. String Bean here had done his job.
 What? You were the one slacking off,
 you stupid meathead.
 Looks like you made a mistake
 in overestimating your strength  and splitting up your forces, elf.
 You expect me to believe you?
 Care to explain how you  two were able to beat them?
 Just like this!
 We won't give you a chance...
 ...to attack!
 I'm sorry. My magic seems to automatically
 attack anyone who tries to attack me right now.
 At least entertain me a little, humans.
 Bring it on.
 That level of spatial magic is astounding!
 There's no spatial mage in this kingdom  who can cancel a spell like that.
 And he has it protecting him  automatically, at all times?
 No one could ask for a better shield!
 Father, Miss Finnes...
 Leave this to us and run!
 Enough!
 You're just the Black Bulls' transport!  You don't stand a chance against Langris!
 It doesn't matter if I'm just  the Black Bulls' transport,
 or if he's the Vice Captain  of the Golden Dawn.
 Right now, the only reason I'm fighting...
 is because I'm his older brother!
 Finral...
 Could you not underestimate  my squad's wheels?
 What? Er...
 Yeah, you're in the way, so...
 Get moving, will ya, old man?
 Langris! My dear little Langris!
 Yeah, you too, old lady.
 Langris!
 Finral, please come back alive.
 I will. Along with Langris.
 Hey!
 Why didn't you let me escape first?!
 Oh.
 Honestly, you're all worthless.
 Hang on, now. I still have  to tear you to pieces.
 Langris...
 Seems like this kid's definitely  gonna be worth slashing apart.
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe...
 Lunatic Slash.
 You stupid mantis!
 Whoa! Talk about an insane way  to help someone escape!
 Just remember, he's the king!
 You gouged my slashes. Nice, very nice!
 He only sees the enemy now!
 You still think you have  a chance against me?
 Know your place, humans!
 He can actually use attack spells  while also using his automatic defense?
 Come on, man.
 If any of these hit you,  you'll be dead instantly.
 Spatial Magic...
 Spatial Magic...
 Archangel's Crash!
 Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!
 The difference in our  magic power is too great!
 I can't even block half of these with my magic!
 Avoid the rest any way you can!
 Damn it!
 Who do you think you're  ordering around, Finral?
 Dark Magic: Black Hole!
 Reinforcement Magic: Leg Strength Boost!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked  Lightless Slash!
 Yami!
 Thanks!
 We'll have to do something  about that defense
 if we're gonna get anywhere near him.
 But if he keeps attacking  us this relentlessly,
 Finral's magic won't be able to keep canceling him out.
 A long battle puts us at a disadvantage.  If we start a fight, it needs to be quick.
 We'll have to force our way through!
 And for that to happen...
 We need more than one attack  to break through that defense.
 I can take care of one side...
 I haven't had a prey like  this in a long time.
 I want to slash him...  I want to slash him so much!
 Let me slash ya!
 Jack's blades can cut  through all sorts of spells
 by using his innate instincts to  transform the very nature of his magic.
 And all because he wants to slash things.
 Like this?
 And even though spatial  magic has unique properties,
 he's still able to slash through it.
 Wh-What?
 And there he is! The tall, scrawny,  perverted weirdo genius!
 Severing Magic...
 Dark Magic...
 Dark Cloaked...
 Cut through...
 ...space!
 Death Scythe!
 Dimension Slash!
 Yes!
 Tch!
 I was surprised that they were  able to get rid of my defenses,
 but it seems they were one move short!
 You can't defend or even  attack with your spatial magic!
 My magic can't defeat my enemies.
 But...
 Return... to nothingness!
 Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!
 Wha—
 He dropped his defenses so he could transport the others?!
 My Fallen Angel's Wingbeat forcibly  moves someone from one point to another.
 I'll save you along with my friends!
 Too bad, human!
 I'm just a little bit faster!
 You're all just going to die at once!
 These guys are Magic Knights Squad Captains!
 They'll do something about this!
 The more I slash, the faster my blades become!
 It's time for your nap, little boy!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked  Lightless Blunt Strike!
 This time, it should—
 You're just humans...
 How dare you do this to me?!
 You petty... dirty, ugly humans!
 Disappear!
 Now he's really lost his mind.
 What's the deal with this  intensely wicked magic?
 Tch!
 What the hell are we supposed  to do with this? Damn it!
 No... It's all over.
 When he's that far gone, there's no  way he'd notice my puny magic.
 Langris...
 Thinking back, we've never actually  fought ever since we were kids.
 I always ran away, using my  lack of talent as an excuse.
 Even though I'm your older brother,  and even though I realized you felt lonely...
 This is... my last chance!
 Your big brother's pretty confident  when it comes to agility and accuracy.
 I'm going to stop you, no matter what!
 Come here...
 Langris!
 Langris... Langris... Langris!
 Langris!
 For the talented little brother,  you sure are a handful. Honestly...
 I'm pretty weak, so...  I'm sorry I took so long.
 Langris...
 Seriously...
 You've got some nerve, taking all the  glory when you're nothing but a wimp.
 Well done, Finral.
 Now, what I really want to  know is... what's their endgame?
 Are they gonna call it a day after  they slaughter all us humans?
 I have a feeling they're  still hiding something.
 Finally... Soon, I'll be able  to see you awake, Licht.
 Did you also just get here?
 Brother, that's not Licht.
 You're Patry.
 I knew you always looked up to Licht,
 but you finally decided  to look like him, too?
 What do you mean, ""finally""?
 When I reincarnated, I just  happened to end up in this body.
 This was my fate.
 Man, you're creepy.
 Hup!
 Hey! It's been a while, Droit.
 I just reincarnated, so it doesn't  feel like it's been that long.
 I see. Hey there, little Eclat.
 Good evening.
 Raia, where's Licht?
 Hey, good to see you, Patry.
 Maybe because his body's artificial,
 or maybe because he's the one who activated  the forbidden reincarnation spell...
 His memories aren't completely  back yet, and he's asleep right now.
 I see.
 Well, anyway, the gang's all here now.
 Everyone else is waiting in the back.
 We may all be here now,
 but I'm pretty sure the Golden Dawn's already taken care of all the humans.
 There was a huge chunk  gouged out of the castle.
 Looks like Latry went a bit crazy.
 I'm sure that seedy-looking king  is no longer alive, either.
 Now all we have to do is fit the final
 magic stone into the pedestal in the castle,
 and activate the spell that  uses the entire kingdom.
 That magic stone is  already within our hands.
 We'll wash away the malice  that afflicts us as a side effect
 of the forbidden spell,
 and complete our reincarnation.
 We'll wipe out all of the humans,
 and we'll take back this world,  making it a peaceful world for elves alone.
 I'm gonna bet that there are a  bunch of tough guys in there.
 I wonder what the rest of my dumbasses  and the other Magic Knights are doing.
 I'm gonna flatten all the elves  myself if they don't get here soon.
 Nah, I'm gonna slash 'em all first.
 No, it'll be me.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Me
 Me.
 I'm gonna flatten all the elves  myself if they don't get here soon.
 Nah, I'm gonna slash 'em all first.
 No, it'll be me.
 No, me!
 I told you, I'm gonna kick all their asses!
 And I'm telling you that I'm  gonna kick all their asses!
 No, me!
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me...
 Me!
 Tch! You piss me off.
 Hey, stop copying me.
 Wha—
 I said stop copying me!
 Wha—
 What the hell's going on?
 We keep doing the same things!
 After all's said and done, Yami and Jack are totally in sync.
 Shut the hell up!
 My beautiful voice, my beautiful flowers...
 Everything about me,  Kirsch ""Beautiful"" Vermillion, is beautiful.

110,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Burning with rage toward humans, the Magic  Knights who reincarnated as elves attacked.
 Asta and the others headed toward  the royal capital to stop them
 and encountered Rades, Valtos, and Sally,
 who had been sacrificed in order to  reincarnate the elves, and almost died.
 You guys piss me off, too, but right now,  I want to kill that bastard Licht.
 The three former Eye of  the Midnight Sun members
 joined them, and they  all hurried to the capital.
 Meanwhile, at the royal capital...
 To save her brother Nozel  and protect the capital,
 Noelle awakened a new spell.
 You're mine!
 Langris!
 As for Finral...
 I'm your older brother!
 Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!
 This is... my last chance!
 Your big brother's pretty confident  when it comes to agility and accuracy.
 I'm going to stop you, no matter what!
 Come here...
 Langris!
 He finally stopped his younger brother  Langris's destructive rampage,
 which began when Langris  reincarnated as an elf.
 But now, Patry, who had  returned to the hideout,
 was about to set a  terrifying plan in motion.
 Now all we have to do is fit the final
 magic stone into the pedestal in the castle,
 and activate the spell that  uses the entire kingdom.
 We'll wipe out all of the humans,
 and we'll take back this world,  making it a peaceful world for elves alone.
 Now, then...
 As soon as those two wake up,  we'll have all the actors in place.
 The Raging Bull  Joins the Showdown!!
 Morning. How do you feel  after that long nap...
 Fana? Vetto?
 Do you remember your previous incarnations?
 Yeah. We were the Third Eye, weren't we?
 Vetto the Despair
 Fana the Hateful
 Fana the Hateful, Vetto the Despair,
 and Raia the Disloyal, was it? How hilarious.
 Vetto and Fana were previously part  of the Eye of the Midnight Sun's
 elite three, known as the Third Eye,
 where they fought against Asta and the others.
 Vetto lost his life, and Fana's soul  left the body it had inhabited,
 allowing that body to start a new life.
 Raia incubated the general traits of  the human bodies they had inhabited
 and prepared new bodies  for their souls to inhabit.
 Welcome back.
 Since we're short on time,
 I could only incubate your bodies long  enough for you to be about fifteen.
 Now you're smaller than me, Vetto.
 Well, I've died twice now.  I can't exactly be picky.
 Yeah.
 Creating duplicate bodies  with the exact same mana...
 I've really gotta hand it to Sally  and her research on this one.
 Too bad she's probably dead by now.
 My mind is much clearer this time.
 We used the evil eye
 to force your previous incarnation,  so your malice was probably stronger.
 Evil eye?
 True, I did feel half-asleep last time...  like I was having a nightmare.
 Salamander!
 No response.
 I guess Salamander's gone.
 So someone else who was qualified  showed up while Fana's soul was away?
 Well, you're strong enough right now,  even without Salamander.
 Guess you're right. If nothing else,  there's no way I'd lose to those stupid humans.
 All right, I'm gonna take  you to the Grimoire Tower,
 so hurry up and let one pick you.
 Actually, before that, we need some clothes.
 Especially Fana.
 They do seem a bit bigger than they  were the last time you were fifteen.
 Soon this false royal capital created  by the humans will be no more.
 It appears they've finally gathered up above.
 Come to think of it,
 they must've received the revelation  in preparation for this moment.
 Those who guide the elves...  The Apostles of Sephira!
 The Apostles of Sephira
 Licht!
 He may seem like that right now,  but I'm certain Licht is actually in there.
 Once the reincarnation is fully complete,  he'll be back to the same old Licht.
 Right...
 Wait, where's that one boy?
 Well, the weird thing is...
 He was reincarnated, but somehow,  his personality was still the human's.
 Wait, what?
 Don't worry. He'll be with us  once everything is complete.
 Let's go wait over there.
 Right.
 Man, look at this view.
 The party's in full swing.
 All right. Let's get started.
 By infusing Gravito Stones with magic,
 we will open the door to the underworld
 that was sealed under Clover Castle!
 The hell is that?
 What's going on?
 Nozel, the castle...
 What in the world is that?
 It's a magic space that acts as the  border between this world and the next.
 The elves of antiquity entrusted it  to the humans in an ancient pact.
 It's called the Shadow Palace.
 Only the Apostles of Sephira,  ten elves who are able
 to receive divine revelations, can open it.
 See?
 When we put the final magic stone  in its pedestal inside the palace,
 the elves' reincarnation  will be complete!
 In exchange, the souls of the  humans who owned these bodies
 will be sent to the underworld!
 And because I am so beautiful...  I shall not allow that to happen!
 David's dice magic acquires effects
 that give him an advantage
 depending on his roll.  Better rolls mean more advantage.
 But getting this much power from a two...
 This is absurd!
 I mean, it probably won't do you  much good, but give it your all.
 What in the world was that about?
 So basically, there's a magical  space spreading over there.
 I don't know what the hell's over there,  but this looks pretty bad.
 Well, why don't we head on over?
 We will not let you get in the  way of the Apostles of Sephira!
 Guess they're not just  gonna let us go over there.
 Bring it on!
 I'll slash you all up!
 Uh, fighting those numbers without Finral's  spatial magic is gonna be a bit rough.
 Damn it!
 It's just one thing after another...  Give us a break already, damn it!
 What should we do?
 That's...
 Everyone!
 Are you okay?!
 So basically, there's a magical  space spreading over there.
 I don't know what the hell's over there,  but this looks pretty bad.

 Don't worry, everyone! We're no one suspicious!
 We're the Black Bulls,
 here with some other guys who  ended up joining us for reasons!
 What... is... that... black... castle... back... there?
 Looks like Gauche is chilling on top of the enemy base.
 We're coming to save you, Gauche!
 P-P-Please wait!
 Where the hell is Licht?!
 A stupidly huge... bull?
 So you've finally shown yourself, Henry.
 What kind of entrance was that?
 Welcome, you dumbasses!
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Mister Yami!
 Hey, Finral's passed out behind the captain.
 What?! Are you okay, Finral?!
 Wait! You already woke up once?!
 Really?! Then you should've woken up faster!
 La! Eat my cooking and feel all better!
 All of you, eat!
 You guys are way too late!
 You should thank me for keeping things  smoothed over until you got here!
 Oh, gosh, I felt so helpless without them!
 What the heck, Noelle?! What even  is that outfit?! You look so cool!
 You were the ones in trouble!
 You're the one who should  be thankful to us, Lady Noe!
 Hey, now... What the hell is that mess?
 It's not exactly clear to me either,
 but they've always been a mess.
 They're our teammates, the other Black Bulls!
 Curse you, humans! It doesn't  matter how many of you show up!
 You're no match for us elves!
 Here they come!

 I wanna slash 'em.
 Well, don't, dumbass!
 The Black Bulls...
 Even here, you intend to get in my way?
 That one is troublesome.
 Magic that interferes with natural laws...
 A witch, eh?
 That's the cornerstone of their defense.
 I'll go.

 Ah, guess you're finally awake.  You somehow sleep even more than Raia.
 This will be your first spell in several  centuries, counting your past life.
 Are you gonna be okay?
 There's no problem.

 Dream Magic: Glamour World.
 Wha...
 What the heck just happened?!
 I can sense the magic of the vanished pieces,
 but they don't exist anywhere.
 Miz Vanessa... and Magna and Luck...
 and Miz Charmy and Sally... are all gone?!
 How beautiful!
 The moment Captain Dorothy's  magic activates, it's over.
 Its targets are taken to the World of Dreams,
 and there's not a thing they can do about it.
 The World of Dreams?
 Now the cornerstone of their defense is gone.
 Guess we should wrap things up, then.

 Okay!
 Poison Curse Magic:  Dwelling of the Poison Cloud!
 What's the big idea, Gordon?!
 Conversion Magic: Poison to Cotton!
 We're saved! Thanks, Miz Grey!
 Were you trying to kill us, Gordon?!
 Uh, that was teamwork, Asta.
 Leave the rest to us.
 You go on ahead with your precious Licht.
 Please don't say it like that.
 I'm counting on you, Droit.
 Sure. Get going.
 Tch.
 Valtos, open up a path!
 Hey, those jerks!
 Everyone...
 Get... away... from... me.
 Henry!
 It's because he left the Raging Black Bull.
 And without Miz Charmy here,  the others can't recover their mana!
 Everyone!
 No... My body...
 That was one hell of a spell,  and it doesn't look like
 your body can keep up yet.
 Though I don't have much magic  left right now, either.
 Asta...
 Are you all right,  Shriveled Little Mushroom?
 Things aren't looking too good over there,
 but I can't just let Licht go like this.
 I'm sure you dumbasses can handle this!  Surpass your damn limits!
 Yes, sir!
 All right. We'll leave this to you.
 Let's go, beanpole!
 Who died and made you boss, meathead?!
 Big Brother, some of them left.
 Then we need to quickly  kill the ones that are here
 so we can hurry after them.
 Now... it's time for hide and seek.
 Find all of them, Eclat.
 Okay.
 Willpower's not gonna help you now, humans.
 I found them.
 Look at me.
 Mirror Magic...
 Eye Magic...
 Combo Spell: Reflect Iris.
 Wha...
 Th-This...
 I-I can't...
 ...move!
 And...
 ...my magic's...
 Eclat's magic allows her to immobilize  anyone who looks into her eyes.
 It binds them physically,  but also blocks their magic.
 Marie doesn't even have her grimoire yet!
 I guess she's awesome, too!
 Now you can just die, completely helpless.
 Not yet...
 Not... yet!
 I'm not going to give up...
 I'm going to turn Gauche  and Marie back to normal.
 I'm going to...
 stop you, no matter what!
 My body can move again?
 He nullified the magical effects?
 Asta...
 Can all three of you move now?
 Yeah!
 That's Licht's...
 Demon-Destroyer Sword?
 Why does he have it?
 That weapon's too good for you!
 Die and give it back!
 I'll use transformation magic...
 Take that!
 ...to make more mirrors!
 Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!
 Even though it's more powerful...  I know Gauche's magic really well!
 Actually, he kind of pisses me off.
 Always attacking me unfairly  with those weird beams...
 He hasn't actually changed much  after getting his body taken over!
 Yeah... And when he comes back,  he'll insult us even more.
 And he'll keep showing us  the photo of his little sister,
 and making figures of his little sister,  and always having nose bleeds...
 He's... very... creepy.
 We'll get him back to normal,  even if it hurts us,
 so we can complain directly to his face!

 The Eyes in the Mirror
 La! La!
 Wow! Where are we?
 I can't see too well without my glasses,
 but it looks fun!
 What the heck is this weird place?
 This must be the magic of the  Captain of the Coral Peacocks.
 Rouge wasn't able to evade it because  she couldn't identify it as an attack spell.
 This is amazing!
 I think this is one of the most  powerful spells a single mage can produce!
 Now's not the time to be so happy!
 This place goes on forever.  I don't think there's an end to it.
 Huh?! Like that's even possible,  Luck, you dumbass!
 It's probably more possible  than you ever not being stupid.
 The hell did you say?!
 Making the impossible possible is  what happens here in the Glamour World.
 Welcome...
 to the world where I control everything.
 The bed just...
 Everything...
 is as I wish it to be.
 S-S-S-S-Some kind of strange  creature just appeared!
 And it just keeps getting bigger.
 I wonder if it tastes good.
 So you have...
 absolutely no chance
 of winning.
 You can sleep forever now.
 How dare it try to eat us instead?!
 I thought we died, damn it!
 The result changed?
 So that magic really does  have to do with logic.
 That cat really is amazing!
 You're not one of the Black Bulls.
 If you stray too far, her magic  won't affect you, so be careful.
 I see! So it just works on your teammates!
 I guess there'd have to be  limits on a spell this amazing!
 Dream magic and thread magic...
 These two witches are absolutely amazing!
 I wanna research them so bad!
 Uh, I think she's bad news.
 You think so?
 Here! Once you've used magic, eat up so you can recover mana!
 That magic's amazing, too!  You're not a witch, are you?
 Nope. I just like to eat lots.
 An inexhaustible magic supply  and absolute evasion...
 This is not going to be easy.
 If this ridiculous place is magic, too,
 then we can get outta here if we beat her.
 Looks like it.
 Useless.
 I wonder if she can use any magical attribute!
 I wonder what her limits even are!
 This is so much fun!
 Who the hell cares?! This isn't fun at all!
 Actually, what are we even supposed  to do? She's basically invincible.
 Your magic's not that interesting.
 The hell did you just say?! Huh?!
 Wanna fight me?
 This is no time to be playing around!
 Yeah!
 I'm the cornerstone of our defense,
 and Charmy's vital to mana recovery. We can't both stay stuck here.
 We have to hurry back to everyone.
 But...
 All I can do is make sure we  evade with Rouge's magic.
 Okay, time to recover your mana, la.
 Eat, eat, eat, Vanessa!
 Hooray, hooray, Vanessa!
 You can do it, appetite!
 I'm going to slap all of you if I get fat from this!
 There has to be some kind of  limit to her healing abilities.
 An ever-flowing pool of water
 that happens to have blade-fish  perpetually spawning from it...
 A never-ending barrage of attacks...
 My noms!
 Th-That's not good!
 Water, eh?
 Say, lightning boy, could you  attack that pool of water?
 I don't think I can destroy  something that big, though.
 That's fine. Just give it your all!
 Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!
 Aw, it didn't work after all.
 Okay, now you attack, fire protozoan.
 Who're you calling a fire  protozoan, you dumbass?!
 Oh, just shoot it with  everything you've got already.
 Who the hell do you think I am?!
 If I guessed correctly and  that really is water...
 It'll explode!
 Yay! Look at that intensity!
 Wh-What just happened?
 I used electricity to chemically decompose  water, then set fire to what was left.
 Huh?
 Simply put, if you unleash lightning  magic and flame magic on water,
 you can create an explosion big  enough to destroy a mountain.
 Wh-Wh-What were you thinking,  making us do something that dangerous?!
 Who cares? You can use the cat to evade.
 I'll try this with Noelle's magic next!
 That experiment made a  few other things clear, too.
 First, what she's generating are  actual objects she visualized.
 That means real-world  principles work on them, too!
 Nom! This is a real fish!
 Second, because of that,  she can't manipulate
 the spells we cast and the resulting phenomena.
 That's true. Otherwise, that explosion and
 Rouge's ability to manipulate  fate wouldn't have worked.
 And...
 Third, it's still going to  be really hard to beat her.
 There's no end to this!
 We need to hurry up and find a way outta here!
 You don't have that kind of time.
 Charmy?!
 I'm... I'm so sleepy...
 H-Hey! What the hell are you talking about?!
 This ain't no time for... sleep...
 Uh-oh...
 Yeah, this is...
 It appears you couldn't evade the drowsiness.
 Everything that exists in Glamour World  will eventually get drowsy.
 And those who fall asleep  will never awaken again.
 Who do you think I am?!
 I managed to stay awake even during  all of Mister Yami's all-nighters!
 This is bad. At this rate...  But I don't know what we can do!
 Sink slowly into the sleep of death,  unable to do anything within this space.
 Aw, everything that was already  blurry is getting even blurrier.
 Not having my glasses seriously sucks.
 Oh, yeah!
 Hey!
 Do you know what these are? The answer is...
 Glasses!
 Uh, what the hell are you talking about?  Now's not the time for—
 Yay!
 What?!
 Wh-What just...
 What just happened?!
 Everything in this world  happens as she sees fit.
 So things that she visualized  in her head appeared.
 So...
 What this world needs... is an  exit, exit, exit! Make one, please?
 It's hard to not think of something once  your mind has already visualized it.
 Hell yeah! She's only  invincible in this world!
 If we can escape it, we can figure something out.
 What the hell's going on?
 We keep seeing the same  stuff no matter how far we go.
 We can't even find any walls, let alone Licht.
 And this faint ki I feel... Is it...
 Looks like someone's  magic is making us get lost.
 Guess you noticed it,  too, you beanpole weirdo.
 Right back at you, meathead.
 They've got some nerve hiding. I wanna slash them up already!
 I'll take care of them.
 No, I'm gonna slash them up.
 Uh, I found them first.
 What are you talking about? I was first!
 It was me!
 It was me!
 Ugh, you're such a pain in the ass!
 The early bird slashes the worm!
 You're right there!
 Hey, where are you slashing?  The enemy's over there.
 What?! They're right over there!
 Besides, you didn't even hit them.
 Well, neither did you!
 Ugh, whatever! I'm done with you!
 That's my line, you stupid meathead!
 You useless beanpole!
 Go over there!
 No, you!
 Yikes! That was close.
 Though they were technically both  correct in my warped space.
 Thank goodness I rolled a six  in order to keep them busy.
 The higher the number with dice magic,
 the more effective it is  in the situation at hand.
 I won't let anyone get in the way  of the Apostles of Sephira.
 I would appreciate it if
 these two would keep quiet  for just a while longer.
 I-I-I can't keep this up anymore!
 Their overall magic power  is way higher than ours.
 I... am... going... to...  reach... my... limit... soon...
 Why not give up already, humans?
 Not yet!
 We're not done yet!
 Right!
 What should I do? Think!
 If I can get into my black form...
 But I don't even have a chance to do that.
 Asta... Everyone...
 I hate that all we can do is watch.
 Big Brother...
 Yeah. It looks like we're gonna keep  Licht and the others waiting a bit longer.
 Eclat, we're going to do that.
 Okay.
 Here we go.
 Huh?
 Asta!
 This is... the spell Gauche  used to evade attacks.
 Right this way, kid.
 Licht's Demon-Destroyer Sword severs
 the cause-and-effect relationships around it.
 He has the ability to nullify Eclat's  eye magic, so I'll get rid of him first.
 Look at me.
 Nope!
 Can you evade attacks with your eyes closed?
 I can evade using ki!
 Well, in that case... How about this?
 That many... This definitely isn't good!
 Asta!
 This time, it's our turn...
 ...t-t-t-to save him!
 Go!
 I'm gonna rip right through  that in an instant.
 What?
 Now I can fight!
 You're mine!
 You...
 ...looked at me.
 The magic item in his left eye...
 Crap!
 I've had enough of you, brat.
 I'll wipe out every last speck of you
 so you can't fight us again.
 I can't undo the binding spell in time.
 Asta!
 M-My magic can't reach that high!
 Asta!
 Well, see ya.
 Asta!
 Poison Magic: Violet Schirm!
 Transformation Magic...
 Magic Conversion: Poison to Mirror!
 Thank you very much!
 Not bad.
 As we thought... Gauche is way  stronger than usual right now.
 But...
 Move!
 The three of us can do this.
 I can still figh—
 Henry!
 A-A-A-Are you okay?
 Of... course... I... am!
 Magic... please hold out just a little longer.
 Just a little longer!
 Just like many mages reinforce  themselves by using magic,
 Henry uses his magic to keep himself alive.
 His blood vessels, muscles, and basically  all of his organs are very frail.
 He cannot stay alive unless he  continually uses magic to reinforce them.
 What he'd been given was
 a constitution that absorbed magical power.
 The ability to absorb  magical powers from others.
 Despite being born into a renowned  noble family, his body was just too frail,
 and his family... the world could  not accept him for what he was.
 How can this be?
 If we continue to harbor that creature,
 it'll disgrace the great name of Legolant.
 But he's our child!
 I know that!
 This is for our family.
 It was the warped love of high society.
 The only thing Henry's parents gave him
 was a house in the forest that stored up
 magic power while remaining  unseen by others.
 This is how it should be.
 I just cause everyone trouble.
 Are you the resident ghost that  everyone keeps talking about?
 Well... I'm... not...  actually... a... ghost.
 Heya, I'm Yami Sukehiro.
 I just became a Magic Knights Squad captain recently,
 and I'm looking for a hideout.
 Up until that moment, I was basically dead.
 I need you to live.
 But... I...
 Basically, you just need a lively bunch  of people to live here, right?
 My house became the hideout of the  Black Bulls, and up until that moment...
 I was...
 The only reason I have my  life now is because of them.
 That's why I don't care what happens to me!
 He managed to get through Eclat's binding.
 I'm gonna stop you two, no matter what,
 and turn you back into the  normal Gauche and Marie!
 Yes. I'm going to save him, no matter what.
 I don't care what happens to me.
 I'm going to save my friend!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 You Saw
 You Saw.
 I'm gonna stop you two, no matter what,
 and turn you back into the  normal Gauche and Marie!
 I'm Droit.
 I'm Eclat.
 We're never turning back.
 But... I do want to know a little  more about this human named Gauche.
 This doll that looks just like Eclat  that I had when I reincarnated...
 It's just too cute.
 And these pictures of her  in different outfits...
 He's got such good taste!
 This guy knows what he's doing!
 Big Brother?
 O-Oh, I was just...
 Marie's doll and pictures!
 You saw...
 I did.
 I can't move...
 Next... time... on... Black... Clover,

112,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Licht and the other elves  headed to the Shadow Palace,
 which lies between this  world and the next,
 in order to complete the  elves' reincarnation.
 Once the process is complete,
 the souls of the humans being inhabited  by elves will be sent to the next world.
 I'm sure you dumbasses can handle this!  Surpass your damn limits!
 Yes, sir!
 And so Yami and Jack followed  Licht and the elves,
 while Asta and some of the Black  Bulls ended up fighting Gauche
 and his sister Marie,  who had reincarnated as elves.
 Meanwhile, Vanessa and the other  Black Bulls were taken to Glamour World
 and struggled in a face-off with  the Captain of the Coral Peacocks,
 Dorothy, who had reincarnated  as an elf, and her dream magic.
 Everything that exists in Glamour World  will eventually get drowsy.
 But Dorothy's dream magic has the  ability to make anything materialize,
 and Sally uses that to their advantage.
 What this world needs... is an  exit, exit, exit! Make one, please?
 Hell yeah!
 Meanwhile, Asta and the others struggled
 against Marie's magic, which made anyone  who looked into her eyes unable to move.
 But the Black Bulls worked  together to continue the fight!
 I'm gonna stop you two, no matter what,
 and turn you back into the  normal Gauche and Marie!
 I'm going to save my friend!
 Since I know that form's secret, dealing with it won't be a problem.
 It homes in on powerful magic, doesn't it?
 M-My sword is reacting to the magic!
 So just keep flying around...
 Asta!
 Asta!
 Humans Who Can Be Trusted
 Hell yeah! Let's just take a  door and get the hell outta here!
 Yeah!
 Okay, get on this, la!
 It's so fluffy and interesting!
 Luck, pull the rest of us.
 Roger!
 Go!
 You're not leaving.
 That destiny avoidance thing is amazing,
 no matter how many times I see it!
 And it's bad for my heart,  no matter how many times it happens!
 Go, go!
 Just a little further!
 Okay, we're here!
 If I can't make them disappear,  I just have to seal them up.
 Huh?
 N... No...
 Aw, and we were so close!
 You're taking this way  too lightly, stupid Luck!
 Damn it, we were almost out!
 Exit! Exit, exit!
 Give us another exit, damn it!
 If she's concentrating that hard to close them,
 we're screwed, exploding protozoan.
 Look at this delicious meal...
 That's your own damn cotton magic!
 Charmy, wake up! If you fall asleep,  you'll never wake up again!
 Oh, no... If we don't get out,  this might actually be the end for us.
 Anything goes in the dream world...
 Oh, I know! If anything goes,  let's just have her take care of this herself.
 Huh? Herself?
 The hell are you talking about, you mor—
 Just shut up for a while, Magna, 'kay?
 Hey, what's the big idea?!
 Hey, I wanna ask you something.
 If we did this, then that...
 Oho! That sounds fun!
 True, that's definitely worth a try!
 La!
 Hey! Talk louder, damn it!
 You're making me even more tired!
 If I said it any louder, she'd hear me.
 So is there a good way to make this plan work?
 Of course!
 I don't know what you could  possibly be discussing,
 but no matter what you try,  you can't escape this place.
 You will all fall into  your eternal slumber here.
 Okay! Now it's your turn, stupid Magna!
 I don't know what the hell is going on, but...
 Flame Magic: Time Bomb Explosive Scattershot!
 Trying to hide from me in  this world? How futile.
 Is this...
 What we created isn't real, of course.  It's not like the stuff you make.
 It's a doll made out of Charmy's  cotton and Vanessa's thread!
 Then we used the exploding  protozoan's flames
 to create a heat mirage and blur it.
 It's just a fake version of you.
 But for a brief moment...
 ...it must've crossed your mind.
 The possibility that it  might be the real thing!
 Because right now, just like when  I was reincarnated as an elf,
 there are two souls connected  inside the same body!
 So that mirage is probably making you  think of her, even if you don't want to...
 Oh, no...
 The real Dorothy Unsworth!
 Hell yeah! The Captain of the  Coral Peacocks has arrived!
 We couldn't ask for a better helper!
 But I think she's asleep!
 Come to think of it, I heard  that captain's always asleep.
 Wait, don't tell me she's already  fallen into that eternal slumber...
 She woke up!
 Don't freak us out like that!
 Also, hurry up! I can  barely keep my eyes open!
 Are you the ones who summoned me here?
 That was...
 Fantastic, Black Bulls and Glasses Girl!
 Captain of the Coral Peacocks Dorothy Unsworth
 Just leave the rest to me! Your big sister is a captain, after all!
 Holy crap, she's chipper!
 So, how old are you, Big Sister?
 You totally look younger than us.
 Should you be asking that right now?
 I mean, I'm curious, but...
 I'm 27! I'm right at my peak!
 She's older than me?! Oh, no!
 My role as the ""little cutie who's actually older""!
 Go to sleep within the depths  of my soul once more.
 We've each finally found someone  we can share our dreams with...
 So let's have a little fun!
 Like I would ever play with a human!
 Take that!
 Whoa!
 Holy crap!
 I guess anything goes since  we're in the dream world!
 I wanna research this so bad!
 Drool... That shark looks so nummy.
 Amazing... She's a match for her  elf counterpart in this battle.
 This is our chance to recover some mana.
 Charmy, get cooking!
 Roger!
 We'll make it out for sure this time!
 Wait for us, guys!
 I can't get to Gauche!
 Not to mention...
 And while you're at it...
 Keep your eyes shut.
 Oh, no! I'm—
 See ya, brat.
 Thanks, guys!
 We gave some of our mana to Henry!
 He's sucking away our mana  at an incredible speed!
 Get... inside... quickly!
 Comin' through!
 What do I do? Right now, I can  only go black about 2.5 times!
 I used it once before coming to the capital,
 so next time, it'll come undone pretty fast!
 Transformation Magic!
 Magic Conversion: Mirrored Mini Black Bull!
 Go!
 Like it'd actually be that easy.
 You didn't actually mirror the  parts that are expelling magic.
 At this distance, I could...
 This is where we say goodbye.
 Henry?!
 This is where we say goodbye.
 Henry?!
 Going to die in a blaze of glory?
 And try to take me with you?
 No...
 I'm the only one who's going to die.
 I only lived this long...  so I could save my friends.
 What?
 He's absorbing my mana...
 Outside the hideout, my magic  absorption rate skyrockets.
 This isn't magic, either,  so her eye magic can't stop it.
 But this is all useless.
 My mana's not so weak that this  is enough to undermine it.
 You can disappear all on your own.
 That's just fine. My job ends here.
 I'm just happy I got to fight  alongside everyone in the end.
 I'm sure they'll be able  to stop you after this.
 The rest is...
 ...up... to... you.
 Not yet, Henry!
 Live!
 You must be Henry, the one with the  weird illness that sucks up magic.
 Heya! I'm the new squad member, Asta!
 Captain Yami told me about this place  after I accidentally wandered in!
 Don't you worry! I don't have any magic!
 You're always getting magic from them, so you're embarrassed to go see them?
 I don't think you need to worry about that!
 I mean, I'm not one to talk,
 but they're all pretty crazy.
 Once I have better control  over my magic absorption...
 One... day... I'll... go...  see... them... all... myself.
 You will? Then we'll be waiting for you!
 I'm sure it'll be even more fun  once you meet them in person!
 It's like a dream.
 Until I met all of them, I was all alone.
 I didn't care about when I'd die.
 And yet...
 I don't want to die.
 I want to continue living with my friends.
 Let's continue living together!
 Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!
 Transformation... released!
 I don't want to lose a  single one of my friends!
 That goes for you, too...
 Gauche!
 The binding spell...
 It's gone.
 I need you to return those  bodies to Gauche and Marie.
 They're our precious friends.
 You damned humans...
 I can't use any magic!
 Our magic has been sealed!
 They put up a barrier! We can't go—
 No, wait. Our magic is being taken away...
 This is... It goes against all natural law!
 It couldn't be...
 It's the power of a human magic item?!
 That's...
 Excellent...
 I'm overflowing with power.
 Now the elves' magic will be ours!
 The princess is of no use to us now.  She's carrying their child.
 She's no longer fit to be a royal!
 How dare anyone other than us humans  possess strong magical powers?
 Even the idea of coexisting with  such creatures is dreadful.
 We must make them pay for  leading one of our own astray!
 The human royals shall become  the gods of this land!
 I'll never forget those  humans' faces, even in death!
 Tense with fear, but ecstatic!
 Unreasonable anger...
 They kill us because of their greed,
 and their rotten brains warp  the truth to fit their needs!
 Their filthy, disgusting laughter...
 How could you do something like that?!  I just can't understand!
 I will never forgive you!
 It makes me sick!
 My malice is out of control...
 I won't be satisfied until  I rip them all to shreds!
 You filthy, disgusting humans!
 But that...
 isn't them.
 They're just like us.
 They're fighting for their precious friends.
 I'm sorry, everyone...
 At this rate, my malice will take over,  and I won't be myself anymore.
 Do as you will.
 I'm sorry, Eclat.
 No... I'll always stay with  my gentle big brother.
 Then I'm sorry about this,
 but I'm taking my friends back.
 This is even erasing the forbidden magic.
 Licht, why did you...
 Well, whatever. I know you worked  really hard, so I'm sorry, Patry and Raia.
 I'm going to bow out here.
 This also goes for the forbidden  spell that brought us back, but...
 A convenient power that can make it  so that something never happened...
 Do you think such a thing exists?
 Actions come with consequences.  You can't escape that.
 Make sure you never forget that, human.
 Yeah.
 I'll never forget you two.
 You're exactly right. There isn't  a single human you can trust.
 No matter how close you try  to get, they're still strangers.
 Everyone looks out for themselves first.
 They want to have it easier  than the rest of the world.
 And to make that happen, they'd betray  anyone without even a second thought.
 I'm the same way.
 I don't care what happens as  long as Marie and I are happy.
 That was... enough.
 Gauche...
 Gauche!
 Gauche!
 Gauche!
 Gauche!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...
 So close...
 Are you okay?
 Marie!
 I... I'm so glad I didn't... hurt anyone.
 Yeah! And I'm glad you guys are okay, too!
 How stupid are you people?!
 If you're safe, that's all that matters!
 You were about to die for someone else!
 And now, our precious hideout  is reduced to rubble!
 I'm only ever thinking about Marie and myself!
 As long as we're safe,  I don't care about anything else!
 I only joined the Black Bulls  for our own sake!
 I never planned on being  buddy-buddy with all of you!
 And deep down inside, I don't trust  a single one of you bastards!
 Big Brother!
 You should've just left me alone!
 He really doesn't get it, does he?
 I thought he was smarter than that.
 W-We obviously know he only cares about  himself and his little sister by now!
 You're... the... moron.
 That's not what you're  supposed to say right now!
 Come on! Look at us!
 Big Brother!
 Ugh, damn it!
 Thanks... you jerks.
 It's our pleasure, you sister-loving jerk!
 Get off me, you numbskulls!
 Oh, come on! Give in to the love, you jerk!
 You're suddenly calling me ""jerk"" a lot!
 I'm so embarrassed!
 Then get off of me already!
 But we're the Go-Gau Duo!
 Don't give us a name!
 That's...
 Things are getting exciting!
 Shut up!
 Uh... things are getting really crazy!
 We'd be dead by now if it  weren't for this kitty-cat!
 Look!
 It can't withstand the dreams of two people?
 Glamour World...
 is collapsing!
 Ah, that was so much fun!
 I feel so much better now!
 Take care of my body, 'kay?
 See you later!
 I'm glad I got to meet you.
 Not all humans are consumed  by betrayal and greed.
 Don't you think so after seeing those kids?
 Our enemy's got an  insane amount of magic...
 So we can go all out, right?!
 Hell yeah, we can!
 Her power and magic were top class,  but the compatibility was just awful.
 She didn't finish us off in one blow,  so we had time to come up with a plan.
 We're all working together, la!
 True...
 Combo Spell: Flame Lightning  Exploding Cannon!
 Welcome back, everyone!
 I'm so glad you're safe!
 Oh, Gauche! You're back to normal!
 Thank goodness!
 Now we're all best friends again.
 For now, just eat this, 'kay?
 Don't go stuffing food in my mouth, domehead!
 Damn it, that's good!
 It's a magical nummy  that recovers your mana!
 Eat up, sweet child.
 This food is so yummy!
 The psycho woman?! What the  hell is she doing here?!
 Stay away from Marie!
 Aw, I can't research her?
 I'll murder you!
 Never mind that! Since we both got  taken over, let's fight each other next time!
 No!
 And now, the Captain of the  Coral Peacocks is back, too!
 And right back to sleep.
 Tch! Guess all the tension's gone.
 Y-Yeah...
 Whoops, I slipped!
 Now it's raining Noelle and Zora!
 What the hell's the big idea?!
 I-It's not like I was jealous  that you all looked like
 you were having so much fun or anything.
 Yeah, whatever! You're stepping  on me, so get the hell off, Lady Noe!
 I'm royalty. I have every  right to step on you.
 I have seniority, damn it!
 Miz Charmy! Please go feed Henry!
 Are you the one who's hungry for nummies?!
 I'm... starving.
 All right! Finral's sorta missing right now,
 but the rest of the Black Bulls are all here!
 Once we're all recovered,  we're gonna go after Captain Yami!
 Yeah!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Leave It to Me!
 Leave It to Me!
 Thank you all for your hard work!
 gLaMoUr wOrLd
 This is my dream world, Glamour World!
 To thank you, I'll grant you any wish!
 Then I want meat! Please bless  us with some nummy meat!
 Sure thing! Meat coming right up!
 La?!
 I wanna go all-out with someone!
 Sure thing!
 With these on, you can hit anyone as  much as you want, and they'll be fine!
 Huh?
 I think we're going to be fighting all night,
 so I'd like to take care of my skin.
 I want some serious muscles  like Captain Yami!
 I got you both!
 You just keep doing whatever!
 This is a nightmare! A nightmare!
 All right! Let's go to the Shadow Palace!
 We need to end this! And then,  we're gonna all come back here!

113,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Making the impossible possible is  what happens here in the Glamour World.
 Vanessa and the others were pulled  into the world of fantasy
 and faced off with Dorothy,  who had reincarnated as an elf, but...
 Combo Spell: Flame Lightning  Exploding Cannon!
 They all worked together to defeat  Dorothy and escape Glamour World.
 Combo Spell: Reflect Iris.
 I can't...
 ...move!
 Now you can just die, completely helpless.
 Meanwhile, Asta and the other  Black Bulls were fighting
 Gauche and Marie, who had  reincarnated as elves,
 and found themselves in danger!
 The rest is...
 ...up... to... you.
 Not yet, Henry!
 Live!
 I don't want to die.
 I want to continue living with my friends.
 Let's continue living together!
 I don't want to lose a  single one of my friends!
 That goes for you, too...
 Gauche!
 I need you to return those  bodies to Gauche and Marie.
 Asta managed to expel the  elves from Gauche and Marie,
 and was successful in  returning them to normal.
 Thanks... you jerks.
 All right! The Black Bulls are all here!
 Once we're all recovered,  we're gonna go after Captain Yami!
 Yeah!
 Storming the Shadow Palace
 So that must be the Shadow Palace...
 You know what that is?
 Indeed.
 Spatial magic from ancient times...
 To think it actually existed.
 They say that you can find extremely  powerful ancient magic items
 and treasures inside.
 So exactly what are we supposed to do?
 Yes, I wonder...
 All right! Eat up, everyone! La!
 Captain Yami and Captain Mantis  already went in,
 but it seems like there  are some powerful enemies,
 so we're gonna recover our  mana and then go help!
 Here, Marie. Say, ""Aah...""
 Oh, stop it, Big Brother.
 No need to be shy, my goddess!
 ""Aah...""
 I told you, I don't want to.
 Come on, Gauche. No need to be shy.
 ""Aah...""
 My beautiful magic is recovering beautifully.
 All the pain in my entire body is gone!
 Thanks, Mimosa!
 It was nothing, Asta.
 Now I can fight in my black form again!
 Go on. Eat up, Mimosa.
 Thank you.
 Honestly, all you ever do is get hurt.
 You overdid it again, didn't you?
 I swear, you're hopeless without me.
 I mean, you're hopeless anyway!  D-Don't get the wrong idea!
 Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
 Asta, your body's pretty unique,  so make sure you take good care of it.
 Hey! Aren't those Asta's clothes?
 Yeah, so?
 Oh, yeah. Her clothes were all  tattered, so I let her borrow mine.
 H-How does that even happen?
 More importantly, why's a girl from the  Eye of the Midnight Sun with us, anyway?
 It's bugging you now?
 I was promised that I can do whatever  I want with his body after this battle.
 Huh?!
 Huh?!
 Wh-Whatever you want?!
 I didn't say ""whatever you want""!
 But you did! I promise I'll use anesthesia!
 H-H-Hey!
 Wh-What are you doing?!  Are you stupid, Stupidsta?!
 Wait, me?!
 A-A-Anyway, you're in the way of me  healing him, so please step away!
 What? But you're already done healing.
 Stupidsta... you stupidhead!
 Hey, Lady Noe, quit fooling around  and eat to recover your mana.
 You shut your mouth.
 Hey, I have seniority here!
 And? I'm royalty.
 But I'm your senior!
 What's up?
 They're coming.
 Two elves.
 Too slow!
 Die!
 About time you woke up, you fool!
 I apologize for the trouble  I've caused you, my sister.
 Fu... Me...
 Captain Fuegoleon! Captain Mereoleona!
 Captain Fuegoleon! I'm so  relieved that you're awake!
 Wait, and you've got Salamander, too?!
 Former Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings Fuegoleon Vermillion
 Ah, Asta. It appears you've  gotten stronger during my slumber.
 Heck yeah! I'm totally ripped!
 Lady Mereoleona,
 The New Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings Mereoleona Vermillion
 I heard you were supposed to be  resting for at least one more day!
 Who cares? I'm fine.
 What?!
 She seriously is a monster.
 So it appears the Vermillions have  finally returned to the battlefield.
 Lord Nozel is amazing!
 It's hard to believe he just recovered.
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Nozel.
 Hmph. Hopefully this doesn't  affect your performance.
 So you've been chosen by Salamander.  Trying to outdo me again, I see.
 Uh... Wha?!
 Hey, that hole!
 Is it me, or is it getting smaller?!
 Oh, no... We have to hurry!
 When we put the final magic stone  in its pedestal inside the palace,
 the elves' reincarnation  will be complete!
 In exchange, the souls of the  humans who owned these bodies
 will be sent to the underworld!
 ...is what he said!
 How dare you...
 You humans!
 The Golden Dawn's Senior Magic Knights...
 Really? Right now?
 There are no limits to my beauty,
 but apparently, that was the  end of my beautiful magic.
 There's no time.
 But with these numbers...
 Captains, please head to the Shadow Palace!
 We, the Black Bulls, will take care of them!
 As long as Charmy and I are here, we won't die!
 Leave it to us, la!
 Asta, you go, too!
 They'll probably need that sword of yours!
 Roger!
 I wish you luck, everyone!
 Yeah!
 There are still a lot of people taken over  by elves over here, so hurry back!
 Yes, sir!
 I-I'll go, too—
 They'll also need a wizard  with recovery magic.
 Go with them, Mimosa.
 My beauty and I shall beautifully  support everyone here.
 Right!
 I'll be able to protect Asta.  For once, good job, Big Brother.
 I-I—
 Noelle!
 Solid?!
 You go, too!
 Huh?
 I'll admit it... You're definitely  stronger than me right now.
 But I'm going to surpass you someday!
 Because I'm your older brother!
 So go, and make sure you come back!
 Your pride as a royal...
 As a part of the Silva family is at stake!
 Indeed. I'll come back, no matter what, Solid!
 All right, here we go!
 Don't fall behind!
 Come.
 We won't let you!
 We won't let you get in their way!
 Here we go!
 To the Shadow Palace!
 Where the heck are we?!
 What's going on here?!
 Is this... an obstacle to anyone  who tries to infiltrate the palace?
 We're surrounded by strange mana.
 I can't control my magic!
 The Shadow Palace...
 I hear it's the boundary  between this world and the next.
 Wait... Are we going to die?
 D-Don't be stupid, Stupidsta!
 That's not funny!
 I won't die!
 Mimo—
 I-I... I'm so sorry, Asta!
 I-I'll heal you right away!
 Plant Recovery Magic:  Princess-Healing Flower Robe.
 So we're inside the Shadow Palace now?
 Where did everyone else go?
 Heck yeah! I'm fully healed again!
 Thanks, Mimosa!
 First, I'll use Magic Flower Guidepost  to determine the layout of the palace.
 Man, you're so amazing, Mimosa!
 This is...
 There are a number of big spaces,  and I feel an elf's mana in each.
 We're in one of the paths  that connect those chambers.
 It appears our comrades have  been scattered to other locations.
 They'll have to defeat  the enemies waiting there
 before we can all regroup.
 This is not good.
 We're up against the Apostles of Sephira,
 who all possess more magic than  a Magic Knights Squad captain.
 I feel the most powerful magic  in the uppermost chamber!
 That must be him!
 All right! Everyone's just gonna have to  take care of the enemy waiting for them,
 and we'll regroup at the top, where the boss is!
 Right!
 The central chamber is right above us.
 Let us proceed.
 Yeah!
 I dunno who we're up against,
 but Mimosa and I are just gonna have to win!
 Don't tell me...
 These pictures...
 Welcome!
 We've met before!
 Rill!
 Jeez, I keep telling you  that my name is Lira.
 Well, whatever.
 I'm gonna have you guys practice with me  until the last magic stone arrives, 'kay?
 Just wait! I'll wake you up right now!
 But I'm already awake.
 Isn't picture magic fun?
 It took a little while to get used to,
 but I can draw more things than  I could with my old scribble magic.
 We're going to draw a new world...
 On a pure white canvas,  after we've erased all you humans!
 Yeah, I guess it's not  gonna be so easy after all!
 Why...
 Why am I alone?!
 Where did everyone go?!
 Well, if you're that lonely,  I'll play with you.
 It might not be for very long, though.
 Fana? Wh-What are you doing here?
 I wonder if you're mistaking  me for someone else.
 I may be Fana, but I'm not the Fana you know.
 So I guess you're the one I get to fight.
 You've got interesting mana, for human royalty.
 Watch your mouth. I guess I'll have  to teach you some manners, brat.
 Though my body is young, I'm not a  beast that can be tamed by a mere human.
 I heard that you became a captain...  Yet we meet to fight in such circumstances.
 How regrettable.
 The kingdom's ultimate shield, Lord Kaiser!
 There's no need to hold back.  After all, I don't know you.
 Indeed, I shall not hold back,  as that would be rude.
 Lord Kaiser is both capable and virtuous.
 He doesn't like being in the spotlight,
 but I assume he took on the role of Captain
 of the Purple Orcas for  the sake of his subordinates.
 His wife was very worried about him.
 Lord Kaiser is an excellent Magic Knight.
 He has people awaiting his return.
 You will be returning him to us!
 Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath!
 That is an incredibly powerful spell,
 though it shall not reach me.
 Lord Kaiser's vortex magic...
 He uses his own magic to deflect  and disperse his opponents' spells.
 Now, in combination with the elf's magic,
 it's enough for him to withstand spirit magic.
 Magic attacks won't work against him.
 The vortex is not used only for defense, but also for attacks.
 Despite my Mana Skin,  I'm sustaining this much damage...
 On top of that, he's washing my magic away!
 Not good.
 I burned you to a crisp, but you  still came charging at me!
 Such incredible speed, reflexes... and power!
 Not bad, you little brat!
 Right back at you!
 I never knew there was a  human as capable as you!
 I haven't had this much fun  fighting with a brat one-on-one
 since that one time,
 with that super-serious fool.
 He detects magic automatically  and blocks it.
 I have no way of hitting  him with my attacks.
 This unfair strength advantage he has...
 It reminds me of my sister.
 Ever since she was little, she was  audacious and full of spirit.
 I idolized her amazing strength.
 But I also eventually got irritated  with her overly carefree attitude.
 I found you!
 You won't get away this time!
 Sister, it's time for our  training lessons with Theresa.
 Sister!
 Just let her be, Fueggy.
 Mereo will be able to get stronger on her own.
 Theresa Rapual
 That's just the kind of genius she is.
 Looking back on it now, I must've  been jealous of my sister.
 Please wait!
 You're not going to join  the Crimson Lion Kings?
 Correct.
 But why?
 As strong as you are, you'd become  an incredibly powerful Magic Knight!
 You could even become the Wizard King!
 Tomorrow,
 after I receive my grimoire, I'm going  to go explore the strong magic regions.
 Like I have time to waste doing boring  guard duties or dealing with wimpy criminals.
 How stupid.
 Stupid?
 Sister...
 Would you spar a round with me?
 Right here, right now.
 So you're actually going  to go all-out today?
 What a hardnose.
 This huge fight between the eldest son
 and eldest daughter of the Vermillion family...
 would eventually be known as  ""The Tuesday of Blood and Flames.""
 Back then, that fool was on fire!
 You're probably the most  powerful human in this kingdom!
 I'm sure if I defeat you, the other  humans won't stand a chance.
 Be...
 ...gone!
 Be...
 ...gone!
 No.
 She's unorthodox, carefree, and doesn't  let anything hold her down.
 She's crazy, but her blinding  strength is feared by all,
 and she opened up a path for herself!
 He's overbearing, stupidly serious,  and much too responsible.
 His refined and extraordinary  strength is respected by all,
 and they follow his lead.
 She...
 He...
 ...is worthy of being the strongest!
 Reignition...
 ...Times Two!
 He used Salamander as a decoy  and erased his own magic,
 slipped through my vortex detection,  and got right in close to me!
 She used sheer willpower  to get through my attacks
 and loaded the magic she  saved up for her next attack!
 As my sister's younger brother...
 As that fool's older sister...
 I must...
 ...be strong!
 Hey, hey, it's Fana.
 Hm? Fana from the Diamond Kingdom?
 I'm Fana and she's Fana,  but we're not the same Fana.
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 114: ""The Final Invaders.""

114,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Here we go!
 To the Shadow Palace!
 In order to save the souls of those  who had reincarnated as elves,
 Asta and the others stormed  the Shadow Palace.
 These pictures...
 Welcome!
 Rill!
 Just wait! I'll wake you up right now!
 Inside the Shadow Palace,  Asta and Mimosa encountered Rill,
 while Noelle ran into Fana.
 Fana? Wh-What are you doing here?
 I may be Fana, but I'm not the Fana you know.
 Watch your mouth. I guess I'll have  to teach you some manners, brat.
 Mereoleona faced off with Vetto,
 while Fuegoleon faced off with Kaiser.
 Both of them ended up in a heated battle.
 Be...
 ...gone!
 Be...
 ...gone!
 No.
 I must...
 ...be strong!
 The Final Invaders
 Aw, I lost her.
 My Valkyrie Armor... I'm not able to  use it to its full potential yet...
 But I'm far more mobile than she is.
 She must be the complete  version of Fana the Hateful,
 who once possessed Fana  of the Diamond Kingdom.
 In that case...
 Up until now, I was afraid  of its overall power,
 so I've been concentrating on control  and held back on my attacks...
 but I guess I can go all-out!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Huh?
 Huh?! I-I-I'm so sorry!
 Flame Recovery Magic: Phoenix Robe.
 Wow, that was pretty intense!  I lost my clothes again.
 We ended up using forbidden magic,
 so we get to use some magic from the  other world to cast supernatural spells.
 What am I...
 Sorry... I sorta got sick of dying.
 What am I supposed to do about this?!
 Plant Magic: Magic Cannon Flower!
 There's no end to this!
 Damn it... I don't have time  to go into my black form!
 And even if I could, if I can't land a  hit on Rill for sure, there's no point!
 Hm... Maybe the color's too light here.
 Oh, you're still alive?
 At this rate...
 Asta!
 I'm so sorry! I'll heal you—
 Yeah...
 But it doesn't look like we're going  to get a break anytime soon.
 Mimosa! Get on my back, and then  tie us together with vines!
 Huh?
 We have no choice but to combine!
 C-Combine?
 Hurry!
 A-All right...
 Plant Recovery Magic:  Princess-Healing Flower Robe!
 All right! Come at us!
 Whoopsie!
 Aw.
 The elves from the Golden Dawn  are really strong.
 We've been close, but we haven't  managed to strike a decisive blow!
 Not yet!
 This magic...
 Expand your Mana Zones and form magic paths.
 I want all of you to join the  Magic Knights who are already fighting
 and focus all your energy  on supporting them
 with long-range offensive spells.
 Let's go!
 La?
 He's...
 He's beautiful.
 He's no match for my beauty...  But he's beautiful.
 He...
 Are you telling me he gathered all  the Magic Knights that had been
 scattered all over the kingdom  in this short amount of time?
 Yuno!
 I'm so glad you're here!
 Please, have some food!
 I don't think now's the time for...
 What are you doing here, you raccoon?!
 The castle was in trouble,  and they needed my help.
 This food...
 It recovers your magic?
 That's amazing. Thank you.
 That's amazing... Thank you...
 He said it was amazing!
 That's amazing
 That's amazing
 You're very welcome!
 What's the current situation?
 Um, Asta and the captains are  fighting their last battle with
 the enemy's strongest members  in that pitch-black castle.
 The entrance has already closed, though.
 Asta's already in there?
 What is that light?
 Hey! Get away from Yuno this instant!
 But he hasn't had dessert yet!
 Dessert, my butt! I'm his dessert!
 I'll follow you to the ends of the  world and cook you nummy nums!
 Sit tight, Asta.
 Um, Asta's hot rival friend  just got into the castle.
 So did Charmy. No fair.
 Yuno! Where'd you go, Yuno?!
 And what was that weird place we just  went through? And where am I now?!
 Oh, I'm in hell.
 La?!
 What the heck is this place?!
 Miz Charmy!
 Asta!
 How'd you get in here?
 La!
 I have no idea! I was just hanging on to Yuno!
 Yuno's here, too?
 Where are you, Yuno? What is all of this?
 These monsters are spells that Rill drew.
 We have to do something about him!
 Huh?
 Miz Charmy?
 That's not it... This just isn't right.
 I can't draw it right!
 I drew some monsters because I thought
 they'd be fitting for the end of all humans...
 But I actually want to  draw something prettier.
 I don't want to draw something so warped.
 This is all... This is all the humans' fault!
 Look at you, all aggravated.
 You must be starving. La?
 Have some food and calm down. La?
 When did she...
 Shut up!
 Get away from me, human.
 I would never eat anything  you humans made.
 Hey.
 What do you think you're  doing to that food?
 Cotton Creation Magic:  Strike of the Sleeping Sheep!
 In order for me to create,  I need to destroy them first!
 Both the humans and all  the things they create!
 Mi...
 Miz Charmy!
 Miz Charmy!
 What was that chill?
 What is this mana?
 Miz... Charmy?
 Hey... Can I come out now?
 What in the world is this magic?
 It doesn't belong to a normal human.
 Wait!
 She got bigger?!
 This magic... I've felt it before.
 You were born to a human and a dwarf...
 And you have characteristics of both.
 You're a hybrid!
 Between a human and...
 ...a d-dwarf?
 D...
 Dwarf?!
 She didn't know, either?!
 Wait! What the heck's a dwarf, anyway?!
 Well...
 I-I don't know too many details,  since I only heard about them
 from folktales our elderly  butler would tell us, but...
 They were another race that lived long ago,
 separate from the elves,  who also had special skills.
 Hey! Weren't you a sheep?!
 Shut up.
 It spoke!
 None of that matters right now.
 T-True, you have a point.
 More importantly... I'm starving.
 Jeez, you're annoying.
 You may be half dwarf, but if  you're going to get in my way...
 You can disappear, too!
 Well, I hope you make lots of those.
 They're all my food!
 Food Magic: Glutton's Banquet!
 It's... eating magic!
 Isn't Miz Charmy's magic  supposed to be cotton magic?
 No...
 I've heard of this before...
 That hybrids can end up with  two magical attributes.
 This is...
 The magic of mine that the wolf ate... It's becoming hers!
 It's being eaten faster than I can draw it!
 My imagination won't be  beaten by your appetite!
 You're going to regret...
 wasting that food earlier!
 This is for the protein!
 This is for the fat!
 They're just punches enhanced by  magic... but they're so powerful!
 And this one's...
 for the carbs!
 You can't be serious...
 This isn't enough to get rid  of my hatred of humans!
 La! I'm not done yet, either!
 This is for the vitamins!
 This is for the fiber!
 This is for the collagen!
 This is for the sodium!
 Th-This is...
 This is for the potassium!
 This is for the calcium!
 This is insane!
 This is for the magnesium!
 Asta! You go on ahead!
 I'm gonna pound the importance  of food into his body!
 We have to hurry.
 I'm counting on you, Miz Charmy!
 Leave it to me!
 Which way, Mimosa?
 There were a number of paths,
 but a few of them are blocked  because of all the intense fighting.
 If we can just move up...
 Let's use that way!
 Got it!
 Too bad. It's useless, no matter  how many times you attack.
 I'm gonna turn you into ashes soon, 'kay?
 I-If only Stupidsta was here...
 Ast... Huh?!
 I found a chick that looks like  she's worth slicing up!
 Why did it have to be you?!
 Huh?! You got a problem, little girl?!
 Who's that?
 David!
 He's a senior of mine from the Golden Dawn.
 He was possessed by an elf...
 I wonder if someone defeated him.
 Well, this is the perfect opportunity.
 There are faint traces of magic here.
 But it doesn't seem to belong to  humans or elves... What's going on?
 I'll use Magic Flower Guidepost again.
 This is... Below the strongest magic,
 there's a space with something  that looks like a pedestal.
 There are three elves there!
 And this magic is... Yuno!
 Let's go!
 Wait for me, Yuno!
 Well, this is a surprise...
 We sent Ado's group to pick you up,
 but you took them out instead, then got here on your own.
 I mean, I'm glad you got  here safely on your own.
 You'll be giving us that magic stone now.
 I've been waiting for this moment...
 As usual, Ronne, you're so quiet that  I have no idea what you're saying!
 And now, finally... everything will return.
 Including our future...
 And Licht's smile.

 He managed to evade all those attacks?
 Mana Zone: Spirit Storm Double!
 In the time it took to get here,
 this kid managed to level up his power  both as a human and as an elf...
 This kid...
 In terms of sheer native talent,  he might actually surpass Licht.
 My Mana Zone couldn't detect him?
 It wasn't super speed. He just suddenly appeared there!
 Again!
 No... He forced me to move.
 He can forcibly change the position  of someone he's touched once.
 I don't know if it's a magic stone  or not, but that belongs to me.
 Give it back!
 Nice job, Ronne!
 No one ever could beat you at tag.
 Now... we'll finally make things right.
 Yeah.
 I can tell when someone's lying.
 Why was what you just said a lie, Ronne?
 Raia?
 Who the hell are you?
 Huh?
 Don't tell me this reincarnation is...

 I Can Tell When Someone's Lying
 I Can Tell When Someone's Lying.
 You can tell when someone's  lying, right, Raia?
 Yeah, I can tell when someone's lying.
 So if a liar said that they were a liar,
 you'd be able to figure  out if that's true or not.
 Yeah, I can tell when someone's lying.
 I mean, if a liar is telling  you that they're lying,
 they're just honestly telling you that  they're lying, but it's hard to tell?
 But wait. Maybe they're  lying about being a liar?
 But that would mean they're honest,  and honest people don't lie...
 So that would make them a liar,
 but liars wouldn't just come out  and say that they're liars...
 So, um... uh... I...  I don't know. I don't know.
 I don't know... I don't know...  I don't know...
 This is a famous paradox. All of  you should think about it, too.
 That guy isn't Ronne.
 This magic... Who is that guy?

 Because he betrayed us, we elves  were destroyed by the humans.
 But because I can see through lies, I knew...
 that he didn't actually betray us.
 But I didn't tell everyone that.
 Because I didn't want them to lose any  of their hatred for the humans.
 I wanted to see him one more time,  no matter how many lies I had to tell.
 That was my disloyalty.
 And I guess I get a huge hole  in my chest for that.
 But what the hell is this thing that  just made this hole in my chest?
 They're the biggest liar of all.
 How long were they acting like Ronne?  How long had they blended in with us?

 What's the meaning of this, Ronne?!
 The three leaves of the clover  represent faith, hope, and love.
 Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.
 And...
 Within a fifth leaf...
 resides a demon.
 This reminds me...
 of the day I took advantage  of the bond between
 the two mages chosen  by the four-leaf grimoires,
 and created a grimoire of despair.
 I can finally obtain what  should've been mine.
 This magic doesn't belong to an elf!
 This Shadow Palace, which lies  between this world and the next...
 And the spell of the magic  stones that can draw out
 what I desire from the land of the dead...
 Welcome home.
 I'm back.
 Ronne!
 What is this cold, pitch-black magic?
 Don't tell me he's...
 A demon!
 What in the world is that creature?
 Thought it's still incomplete, I haven't  been in my own body in centuries.
 What a wonderful feeling.
 Elf that was chosen by a  four-leaf grimoire, I commend you.
 I praise you from the bottom of my heart
 for everything you've done up to this point,  as well as the results you have shown me.
 And now, I shall have you taste the  depths of despair, like he did back then.
 What... are you talking about?
 What's... going on?
 That day, the one who tricked the  humans into destroying the elves
 was me!
 The humans were easy to manipulate,  as they wanted power.
 We can come to understand each other.
 And then you lot managed to let me fool  you in the most amusing way, too.
 The revenge went according to plan.
 All of you are fools!
 How dare you?!
 ""Return.""
 Hey! That body belongs to Captain Vangeance.
 I won't let you die like that.
 I'd prefer to deal with you later, if possible.

 Are you awake?
 Thanks to you, the time that had stopped  for me will finally begin moving again.
 I commend you, hero.
 Five centuries ago, they got in my way,
 and though I was close, my incarnation failed.
 What... are you talking about?
 You were the next one I set my sights on.
 A new sacrifice that was loved by mana,  still young, and swayed oh so easily.
 Tragedy and a sense of mission...
 That was enough for you to  dabble in forbidden magic,
 which allowed the elves' souls to  be reincarnated in human bodies.
 What are you talking about?
 The one... The one who reincarnated us is Licht!
 Even if it meant dabbling in forbidden  magic, he gave us our last hope!
 Wrong.
 Because I was the one  who reincarnated you elves.
 Wha...
 Your leader doesn't want  the humans exterminated.
 Restoring the elves and that revenge  you longed for... All false goals.
 You merely walked down the  path I prepared for you,
 neatly leading the other fools after you.
 You truly did a splendid job.
 In the end, it led you to a  future that Licht didn't want,
 It's a lie... It's a lie... It's a lie...  It's a lie... It's a lie...
 and my incarnation, which finally  allowed my soul to return to my body.
 I'm... like Licht.
 I was chosen by the four-leaf clover...
 Indeed. You were chosen...
 as my brilliant, foolish pawn.
 Excellent work.
 What the hell is that black thing?
 Are you telling me Licht was  being used by that black thing,
 just like he used us?
 Patry... Everything we'd done...
 This is just too amusing!
 Elves and humans... Your dreams and  ambitions make the best playthings!
 Don't give me that crap!
 You just show up outta nowhere  and make a mess of everything.
 You're super strong and scary,  but who the hell do you think you are?!
 Whatever you are, you piss me off!
 You're just a piece of shit...
 ...and my dream won't lose  to the likes of you!
 Asta! Yuno!
 The magic that's welling up from him
 is changing the objects around him into wind.
 Is Licht's child... waking up inside him?
 Oh? His overflowing anti-magic is  erasing all of the magic around him.
 Is his magic resonating with my own?
 ""Storm of Blades!""
 Asta!
 Yeah!
 Yuno's taking care of the physical blades,
 and Asta's taking care of the magical blades...
 They're using both of their  powers to block all of them!
 You and I...
 ...can do this!
 If you're going to get in our  way, then you can break!
 ""Heal.""
 Damn it! What's going on?
 He can do that?!
 How impressive that you  were able to wound me.
 Having the power of a spirit  and being loved by mana...
 And the power of a meddlesome  comrade who dwells within
 the five-leaf grimoire that  I should have possessed.
 I don't know where you came from,  but you may have that grimoire.
 When the owner of a four-leaf grimoire  is engulfed in deep despair,
 a five-leaf grimoire is born.
 At last, I possess both my body  and my pitch-black grimoire.
 I can rule over the current world as  a demon with my true form and power!
 Five hundred years ago, I succeeded  in creating a grimoire of despair,
 but I was met with resistance in the very end.
 So this time, by using  forbidden reincarnation magic,
 I mingled wicked thoughts with their souls,
 making it easier to steal their egos.
 I wanted my stepping stones to do their job  and allow themselves to be stepped on.
 Empty hearts are so simple.
 For the sake of this moment,  I have deceived, killed, and plundered.
 And oh, was it delightful!
 You're unforgivable...
 I'm not going to let you get away with that!
 Unfortunately, I'm not the  one you have to deal with.
 Rampage as you please.
 Let your hatred and despair guide you.
 Pat...ry...
 The final state of an elf who's  overflowing with malice...
 A dark elf!
 Demon Light Magic:  Light Swords of Conviction.
 Black light!
 And it's so fast. Even with my Mana Zone, I couldn't evade all of it!
 Asta! You alive?
 Of course I am, Yuno, you jerk!
 What insane numbers and force! The weight  of that attack was off the charts!
 If the anti-magic flooding out of me  hadn't softened it, I'd be dead right now!
 Damn it! He's gotten way stronger!
 Both the destined one who carries  the hybrid child of elves and humans
 and the defective, magicless one  who's somehow able to handle
 the five-leaf grimoire will  meet their ends here.
 I'm not sure who you are, demon,
 but if you don't steal that body soon,  you'll just die along with it.
 What the heck's going on?
 I don't feel any ki from him at all!
 This is just a heartless, burned-out shell now.
 It's merely casting scorched shadows  of the spells in its grimoire.
 At least have some fun with it.
 So the exit is up above, is it?
 Now, if you'll excuse me... Farewell!
 Hold it, you bastard!
 Tch.
 Yuno!
 Mana Zone...
 Spirit Storm!
 Please move...
 You probably can't forgive  me because I'm human,
 and I can't forgive you, either.
 But I know...
 We should've been able to  understand each other!
 I'm begging you! Move!
 Hate...
 Crap...
 This spell is...
 No matter what happened in the past...
 No matter what hardships  and pain we go through...
 I know we can come to  understand each other!

116,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demons.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The terrifying truth revealed  by the resurrected devil:
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun
 had devoted their lives to getting  revenge against the humans,
 but that was all part of this  devil's 500-year-old plan.
 Rampage as you please.
 The final state of an elf who's  overflowing with malice...
 The devil turned the  haggard Patry into a dark elf
 and had him attack Asta and Yuno.
 Hate...
 Crap...
 This spell is...
 This magic is...
 The Ultimate Natural Enemy
 This spell is...
 the one that gave  Captain Yami all that trouble.
 And now, it's even more powered up!
 Gauche managed to help us back then, but...
 But...
 Patry...
 So much magic is being concentrated.
 This is bad!
 Hate... Hate...
 Demon Light Magic: Ray of Divine Punishment!
 Die.
 But with how Yuno and I are now...
 We somehow made it through.
 Asta!
 Thanks, Yuno!
 That was close.
 He should've used up most of  his mana with that spell.
 Hate...
 Hate...
 I hate you!
 You've got to be kidding me!
 You can't be serious.
 That sinister magic just keeps welling up...
 Even if I can't change into my black form...
 I can't lose here!
 Asta! Yuno!
 Die.
 It seems your appearance has changed a bit,
 but we meet at last.
 Nozel!
 Captain Nozel...
 I...
 am nowhere near as lenient as him!
 Hate... Hate...
 You cannot defeat me.
 Magical attributes play a big role  in how a magic battle can play out.
 That is why Magic Knights act in teams,
 so that they can cover each other's  weaknesses when they go on missions.
 And that is exactly why Nozel  Silva's all-purpose magic
 is a team unto itself.
 His ever-changing mercury magic
 can face any enemy, and has  always yielded results.
 Hate...
 My magic's affinity with your light  magic is better than anyone else's.
 Using vast, sophisticated magic to  create a huge amount of mercury,
 he instantaneously hardens it, smooths  its surface, and reflects the light.
 Though I don't plan on losing to the one  I have the worst affinity with, either.
 And I have been sharpening my  skills for this moment, too.
 Captain Nozel...
 He always seemed cold, but he  is the Captain of the Silver Eagles.
 He's super amazing!
 But what's going on with the other guy?
 He unleashed all that power and  can still move that fast?
 I see you like to scurry away  like the vermin you are, but...
 The preparations are complete.
 Since this spell requires  maximum control and power,
 I couldn't use it in the last battle  because my magic was being disturbed.
 Mercury Creation Magic:  Silver Star of Execution.
 Hate... Hate!
 This spell will trap you and your light  magic while continuously attacking.
 It's an inescapable prison.
 Hate... Die!
 I hate you... Die!
 Let your own deeds
 be your undoing.
 He deflected all of the attacks.
 He has such precise control.
 Whoa...
 Asta and Yuno, was it not?
 I am the one who will become the Wizard King.
 You mentioned that you were going to  become the Wizard King, didn't you?
 Then...
 I guess you're my rival, too.
 Then I guess you're my rival, too!
 I'm going to be the Wizard King.
 No, it's me!
 It's me!
 It's me, me, me!
 Patry... If I hadn't stayed quiet...
 Would you not have ended up like this?
 Hey, Patry... Can you hear me?
 Crap... I think I'm done for...
 Patry... Licht...
 It's warm...
 Why?
 I don't need a reason to save  someone who's about to die.
 It doesn't matter to me if they're  an enemy or from another race!
 Damn it... So in the end,  I'm being saved by human royalty?
 That's why I didn't want  to get involved with them.
 Regardless of the times,  they're always like this.
 Indeed. You were chosen...
 as my brilliant, foolish pawn.
 Now, then... Let's finish you off.
 Hang on a sec! Wait!
 I don't think that's how  this is supposed to play out!
 You can't be serious.
 And how else is this supposed to play out?
 This man is the leader of  the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 He took many lives and threw the  Clover Kingdom into chaos and confusion.
 Yeah, I know that, but...
 Please wait.
 His body belongs to  Captain Vangeance. I can tell.
 Vangeance?
 What are you talking about? His face  and his magic are completely different.
 I'm unsure of the reason why,
 but I can definitely sense  Captain Vangeance from him.
 And...
 He might be able to return Captain Vangeance  back to normal with his sword.
 Leave it to me!
 What are you talking about?  Do you want to die?
 How much do you want to kill the guy?!  Did you not hear a word we just said?!
 Could I at least give it a try? I can, right?!
 Do as you please.
 Thanks!
 This is... way more anti-magic  than I've ever seen before.
 Actions come with consequences.  You can't escape that.
 Make sure you never forget that, human.
 Asta?
 Asta!
 Hate... Hate... Hate...
 What the heck?!
 Is this, like, his memories  or his soul or something?!
 Is everything that was sucked out  through the sword flowing into me?
 That's...
 Hate... Hate... Hate...
 My head hurts so much.
 Unforgivable!
 A time spell tremendous enough to save  all the people of this kingdom...
 Impressive.
 But it appears that you've  used up all the time and magic
 that you had accumulated.
 I'm sure you saw my attack.
 But you couldn't cancel that time spell
 in order to evade.
 Because...
 you are the Wizard King.
 Wizard King...
 Wizard King!
 Hate... Hate...
 Hopeless... Hopeless...
 Sad... It hurts...  Frustration... It hurts...
 Hopeless...
 It hurts...
 For Licht's sake, I... I was deceived.
 Resurrecting everyone was a mistake.
 So many sacrifices that he didn't even want...
 I made the wrong choice.
 I was never chosen at all.
 ""Humans are evil.""
 Did I... just want to believe that?
 If... If that was actually true...
 I mean, William and I were  able to understand each—
 We can never understand each other!
 This is the humans' fault! I hate those fools!
 They cannot be forgiven!
 Humans are all evil!
 That's right...
 This is all... the humans' fault!
 There you are, you bastard.
 Hey, I'm Asta.
 We meet at last.
 So on the inside, I guess  you're a kid about my age.
 What do you want, you... human?
 You were fooled and couldn't protect  what was important to you.
 You lost the light that you believed in...  and you're a mess of emotions. I know that!
 But that's exactly why I'm going to say this.
 Quit giving up!
 What you're doing right now is running away!
 You just stopped thinking
 and locked yourself up in darkness  because it's easier that way!
 Sh-Shut up!
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
 What could you possibly  understand, you stupid human?!
 Shut up with all that ""human"" crap!
 I'm Asta, damn it!
 How dare you kill the Wizard King?!
 He was such an amazing person  who was respected by everyone!
 I... We all wanted to be like him!
 You took everyone hostage  and killed the Wizard King.
 Your reincarnation hurt innocent  people all over the kingdom!
 Just like you can't forgive humans,  I won't ever forgive you!
 That's why we... also...
 After doing all that, where do  you get off acting like this?!
 Huh?
 Just because you did something you can't fix,
 you shouldn't just despair and run away!
 Aren't you supposed to be trying  to stop that devil bastard, too?!
 You made up your mind to do all this so far!
 You did that!
 Even if you weren't chosen,  even if you weren't wanted,
 even if you aren't forgiven...
 You need to stand your ground,  no matter how pathetic you are!
 Wh-What's with you?
 Why are you acting so desperate?
 Just leave me alone!
 Even though I wasn't chosen, wanted,  or forgiven, I made up my mind.
 I'm going to become the Wizard King!
 So... I'm not going to give  up on you guys, either!
 You're...
 We can come to understand each other.
 Asta!
 Asta...
 Holy crap, that was close!
 That brat managed to bring Patry back...
 Honestly... I've never met  such a foolish human before.
 What'd you say, you jerk?!
 Asta...
 I guess you're having Captain Vangeance  hold off for a little while longer.
 The thing that I can do right now...
 Could you see this through  to the end with me?
 Yeah!
 I'm not letting that bastard have his way!
 That must be it.
 The door to the outside.
 And...
 I won't... let you... go.
 You're not even fully awakened yet,  and you already can't forgive me.
 Well, I guess I can't blame you.
 I couldn't take this grimoire from you,
 so I've taken it from someone very dear to you.
 I'm surprised you can manage that,  after spawning that giant demon
 left your soul so unstable.
 Well done indeed.
 I must reward you for all of your hard work.
 I'll kill you off properly.
 ""Lightning Lance.""
 ""Earth Shield.""
 ""Storm of Blades.""
 ""Split open.""
 And... ""Bind.""
 That sword can absorb magic,
 but I imagine it doesn't fare as well against physical matter.
 ""Iron Spear.""
 My word soul magic can not only  make whatever I say happen,
 but it can also summon physical matter.
 You are no threat to me when  you only have one sword.
 Goodbye...
 Leader of the elves!
 Oh? So were was an elf who  wasn't an Apostle of Sephira.
 I saw Baval enter the  Shadow Palace, so I followed him.
 After that, I found Baval unconscious,  and I knew something was wrong.
 You fiend! You're a devil, aren't you?
 Hey, now...
 A devil?
 Do those things actually exist?
 I mean, if anything,  you're way too pasty to be one.
 It looks like Nozel headed toward  the other huge magic that I sensed,
 so I came over here, but...  What's the deal with this thing's ki?
 You keep showing up one after another.
 It's turning into quite the party.
 I can only sense malice from him!
 Human... You came this far  just to get in my way?
 I've got plenty of things to ask and say to you,
 but I'm pretty sure we have to  take care of that guy first.
 I'm also pretty sure I've never seen  a more obvious bad guy before.
 I'm just going to let you  die if you can't keep up.
 I guess you're just as  unreasonable as the girl I know.
 You just make sure that body doesn't get hurt!

 I figured you were on bad  terms with each other.
 Yeah, I can't explain it, either.
 Okay, everyone. Here we go... Petit—
 Oh, come on now, cuties.
 You shouldn't split up so much.
 Okay... He's healed.
 Everyone together, now...
 He's our savior. We need to be careful with him.
 What's this bird?
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What the?!
 Huh? Nero?
 Take me to the demon's bones.
 Did Nero just speak?!
 Wait, I was asleep, so I could still be dreaming.
 Someone pinch my cheek real hard!

 He was called the Wizard King, and he became a legend.

 N-N-N-N-N-N-Ne...
 Did you not hear me?
 S-S-S-S-S....
 Sp?!
 The bird just spoke?
 It must be a spirit, and a noble spirit at that!
 Nero?!
 You spoke just now,  didn't you? No, that can't be!
 This is a dream, right? I'm still asleep, right?
 Wipe off that dumb look and get a move on.  Hurry up with the spatial portal.
 What?!
 This bird just started talking out  of nowhere, and now it won't shut up!
 At this rate,
 humans who have elves within them  might not be able to return to normal.
 What?
 Even worse...
 Anyway, hurry up and take  me to the demon's bones.
 Nero, you're...
 ""Return.""
 That was a splendid cut.
 ""Storm of Blades.""
 Anything goes with you, doesn't it?!
 This black creepy guy's magic...
 ""Earth Shield.""
 Not only can he make the things  he says manifest as magic,
 ""Wave of Flame.""
 ""Iron Spear.""
 he can summon, move, and order  objects around, as well.
 This ""Storm of Blades"" is basically  both of those things at once.
 This is completely nuts!
 He was able to wither  Charlotte's briars, heal himself,
 and keep doing whatever the hell  he wants against the living,
 but considering he hasn't  straight-up ordered us to ""Die,""
 I'm gonna guess he has some limits.
 Ugh, damn it. Just thinking about  all this is a pain in the ass.
 Charlotte!
 I'm Charla!
 Back then...
 ""Wither.""
 Did some of my briars not wither  because they were out of his range?
 I'm assuming that was part of it, but it  comes down to how much magic he has.
 Is the effect of the amount of magic  he puts into his words so great
 that it overwhelms our magic?
 So just barely fending off his attacks while
 we keep trying to figure  him out is all we can do?
 Tch!
 The one thing I've noticed is he can't  stop my dark magic with his words.
 I knew it. He dodged it rather than stopping it.
 I mean, I need my spells to hit him, but...
 Not bad!
 I'm amazed you can move around so  much when you're basically asleep.
 He's right. Licht isn't able to  manifest his full powers right now.
 This fight seems evenly balanced  at the moment, but at this rate...
 ""Storm of Blades.""
 Damn it! There's no end to this!
 This ain't good. That guy's magic  was too overpowered to begin with!

 At this rate, my magic's not gonna hold out.
 And he doesn't seem fazed by any of this.
 I quite enjoy your company.
 You're so pleasantly annoying  that I'm actually enjoying this.
 To think that having my own body  and being able to play with magic
 would make my heart dance with such delight!
 I thank you.
 You've also helped me obtain  the five-leaf grimoire.
 Now I shall use it.

 I do apologize, but I'm a completely  different being than the rest of you.
 From a different dimension, in fact.
 What the hell is this spell?
 Is this from the other world?
 Tch!
 It's like sprinkling water on a hot stone.
 Yeah... That's not good.
 What is this...
 ...magic?
 Traveling this far all at once is exhausting.
 Hurry up.
 H-Hey! Wait up!
 Take out all the magic stones that  are embedded in this monument.
 Magic stones...
 All the magic stones that were taken by the
 Eye of the Midnight Sun are here.
 You're sure I can take them out?
 Hurry it up.
 Now...
 Put all those magic stones into this statue.
 The statue of the first Wizard King...
 I guess they go here.
 All that's left are the eyes.
 This is the last one.
 Is this... magic?
 Watch out!
 This is...
 Our magic is... melting!
 Curses!
 Dark Cloaked
 Black Blade Blunt Slash!
 You...
 It leeched magic and life energy out of me?!
 I guess you won't be able  to hold your sword anymore.
 It's a spell that devours life.
 I merely opened the lid on it,  but it can no longer be stopped.
 Not until it devours humans, elves...  and everything else.
 Shit. This is seriously bad news.
 That evil magic is heading our way!
 What in the world is that?!
 That's the devil's magic!
 Light Magic: Light Swords of Conviction!
 Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!
 It swallowed up our spells?
 Don't let it touch you! Run!
 There!
 Asta!
 Asta!
 I thought I was a goner!
 Asta!
 So anti-magic works against that, too?
 And he's completely unharmed?
 I guess it figured there's  no point in swallowing up
 something that has no magic.
 Unbelievable.
 Hey! Why do you guys sound creeped out?!
 This is...
 As we thought, there's even more of  this eerie magic flowing above us.
 At this rate, the ones in the  other rooms are in danger, too.
 The one with the most mobility,  who can get those
 who have turned into elves out of here...
 Saving the kingdom, and all  of us escaping here in one piece,
 will mean our victory.
 I'll go assist the ones below.
 Come with me, Vermillion.
 Yes, sir.
 You appear to understand  the enemy and what's going on
 up above better than I do.
 If you supplement Asta's anti-magic  with Yuno's spirit magic
 and that elf's light magic,
 you should make it to the battlefield.
 Go.
 Got it!
 Now that your seal has been broken,  that means my seal will also...
 Nero?
 What a pathetic state you're in.  If only my spell was more complete...
 No, the only reason I was able  to return is because of you.
 Huh?
 Welcome back, my prince.

 I had no idea you were such a cute girl!
 If you'd told me earlier, I would've  totally asked you out on a date!
 Why don't we go on a date right n—
 I'm really sorry.
 I sense an otherworldly magic  from the Shadow Palace.
 I see. He must've obtained a body.
 Why are you two...
 Just as I was about to die, she used her  confinement magic to seal me away.
 I was asleep this whole time.
 And with the help of the magic stones,  I managed to awaken, at least partially.
 Such calm yet powerful mana...
 It's far more powerful than even the elves'...
 She's...
 For 500 years, I was just what  you people called ""Nero.""

 Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.
 Huh?
 Thank you, Magic Knight of the present.
 Wait there for your friends' return.
 I'm sorry you had to wait 500 years.
 It's fine.
 We can't let what happened  before ever happen again.
 500 Years Ago
 Clover Castle
 Despite being a noble,  my magic was only able to
 open and close things,  and was considered useless.
 So I ended up a servant...
 to an eccentric prince
 whose magic and talent were  amazing even among royalty.
 I wonder what kind of awful snob he'll be.
 Hey there! You must be Secré.
 Sorry, I'm researching ancient  magic right now, so I can't get up.
 By the way, what kind of magic do you have?
 But he was nothing like I had imagined.
 Sealing magic?!
 What's that? I've never heard of it before!
 That's so unusual! How amazing!
 How should we have you use it?  Just thinking about it is exciting, isn't it?
 Magic that opens and closes locks is vulgar.
 That's not true! Don't seal off your potential!
 Please don't make a face like you  just said something clever.
 Aw...
 Also, your clothes are weird.
 What?! But I made these  clothes myself! Aren't they great?
 More importantly...
 What's more important than that?
 What should I help you with?
 Well... Right now, I'm creating magical tools.
 Magical tools?
 Yup. So that people who aren't  blessed with magic or by their
 magical attribute can  use all kinds of spells.
 That way, I think we can  make our society more equal.
 But that just sounds like a silly dream.
 They're tools to help me with that.
 I think I'll call them magic items.
 I'm sure your magic will help me with this!
 For example, can you seal magic into objects?
 Um... Yes.
 You can?! That's amazing!
 I helped the prince make magical tools.
 He really was nothing like I'd imagined.
 There were members of his family  who didn't like his progressive ideas.
 But he didn't let that bother him,  and he never compromised his ideals.
 He was a strong, honest person.
 Recently he and his sister, Lady Tetia,
 have been sneaking out quite frequently.
 What could they be doing here?
 The other race... The ones blessed with mana!
 Phenomenal magic and skill...
 The same thoughts and ideals...
 The same four-leaf grimoires...
 The leader of the elves, Licht,
 was the first peer and friend  that the prince had ever had.
 We can come to understand each other.
 You elves have truly amazing mana.
 By combining that with the magic-item  technology that we humans created,
 we can make this land  safer and more prosperous.
 Let us live together, hand in hand.
 Magic items that stored and distributed magic,
 and the elves' magic stones, which linked  to another world and amplified spells...
 Through his work with the elves,  spells and magic-item technology
 that would help not only the humans,  but both races to live in peace as equals
 were slowly becoming a reality.
 The prince and Licht were best friends.
 And they were supposed to become family.
 I'm really sorry, but I'm probably  going to be late to your wedding.
 Sadly, Father has summoned  me to the palace that day.
 I know that he and the others  are against this marriage now,
 but don't worry.
 I'm sure they'll understand someday  and give you their blessings.
 I know.
 I'm sure Licht and the others  will be eager to see you.
 But it's likely that even then,
 he was already manipulating  the whole situation.
 I wonder why Father summoned me today.
 We didn't mention the wedding  to anyone, so is it a coincidence?
 I need to hurry to the ceremony.
 No one's here?
 Father, where are you?
 ""Bind.""
 What is this?
 Good day, my prince.
 Minister?!
 No... The evil mana that's coming  from him doesn't belong to him.
 Who are you?!
 Who am I?
 Despair, hatred,
 disloyalty, or death...
 You may call me whatever you wish.
 A soul with evil mana...
 I've read about this being  from another world! A devil?
 Where are my father and the others?
 Who knows?
 Maybe they've gone to destroy the other race
 that's trying to harm the princess and,  indeed, the entire kingdom.
 I'm sure the elves will be quite surprised
 when the humans' violence and greed
 fall upon the wedding ceremony  that only you should know about.
 What?!
 Ah, this is what I'd expect from  the strongest in the kingdom.
 That's some terrifying magic.
 Though I was prepared for that,
 so even you won't be able to escape  from those bonds so easily.
 Once I obtain my body and grimoire,  I'll come play with you again.
 Wait!
 Someone! Isn't there anyone here?
 Anyone!
 Prince!
 Secré!
 What's going on, Your Highness?
 There's a devil plotting something!
 So it wasn't you, was it, Your Highness?
 That magic item we made is gone!
 Secré! Break these restraints!
 Your sealing magic can do it!
 Right!
 Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!
 Faster... I need to go faster!
 Tetia, Licht, everyone...
 That's the magic item we made!
 A five-leaf grimoire...
 I knew it...
 Licht...
 I knew it wasn't you.
 He reclaimed his heart?
 I'm sorry I doubted you for even a second.
 Please forgive me.
 Such a futile struggle!  Now, relinquish your body to me.
 You are the future we believed in.
 You are hope.
 Licht...
 Right now, I am filled with  tremendous negative mana.
 I don't have full control anymore.
 At this rate, that devil will...
 Don't...
 To prevent my magic and body from falling  into the hands of something wicked...
 I've pulled even more negative  magic into myself.
 Magic stones... He used the highest  form of forbidden magic on his own body?
 Don't... Don't do this, Licht!
 I'm sorry. This is my last selfish request.
 You're the only one who can grant it.
 Don't do this, Licht!
 Lumiere...
 Please kill me!
 This was all planned by that devil...
 My prince, let us finish this.
 We're going to save this world!
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 118:  ""A Reunion Across Time and Space.""

 R-Run!
 Where are we supposed to run?!
 Oh, God...
 It's the end of the world.
 It appeared as though the world  would be destroyed by the demon.
 But a single mage...
 Lumiere...
 Please kill me!
 I finally understand...
 why I was born with so much...
 magical power.
 I will not let you...
 become a murderer!
 A Reunion Across Time and Space
 That's...
 The prince!
 Prince Lumiere!
 They used a magic item that I created
 to steal the elves' magic...
 It was supposed to be used so  that we can all share magic.
 Prince... Lady Tetia... What should I...
 Is there still something I can do?
 What were you even trying to do?
 How annoying.
 Wouldn't you have been better off  just giving me that body of yours?
 Of course, if I had taken over your body,
 that light magic would've  been absolutely useless.
 But at this rate...
 Everything will soon be gone!
 The magic stones are amplifying his magic.
 Even if I stop him, the kingdom will be...
 Can I even stop him?
 My prince!
 Our magic item! The one we  made for equality and peace!
 Of course!
 I'll use the magic item we created...
 and absorb his magic!
 Did that work?
 As I suspected... It's impossible  for it to absorb all of the magic!
 He stopped...
 The negative mana seems to be subsiding.
 Lumi...ere...
 Lumiere...
 Soon, I'll marry Tetia and become your brother.
 I'm sure there will be humans  who look down upon that.
 You're probably right.
 But with you...
 I'll be able to create a  peaceful and equal world.
 I truly believe that.
 I believe that, too.
 I'm sure...
 ...it was fate that brought us together.
 Now's your chance.
 Hurry...
 Licht...
 You are the future we believed in.
 You are hope.
 I... will stop you!
 He defeated that monster!
 The prince saved our kingdom!
 He's our savior!
 You stopped me from obtaining his body,
 but that was still quite  an entertaining show.
 I guess I'll just have to take  his grimoire for the time being.
 Stop!
 I won't let you have Licht's grimoire!
 The magic stones...
 You witnessed the end of that elf, didn't you?
 If a human like yourself who isn't  loved by mana tried to use those,
 you wouldn't be able to keep
 your form even if you tried to  perform a puny little spell.
 Like I care. I'm going to use the  magic stones to increase my magic.
 Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!
 This is...
 Confinement magic, eh?
 This girl isn't even concerned about  the effects of using forbidden magic.
 Her seal is a bit vexing,
 but I'll be able to use reincarnation  with the magic stones.
 In that case...
 ""Come.""
 What?
 Even more despair and tragedy for  the soul who possesses the four-leaf.
 I guess I'll just have to  sow those seeds for him.
 Forbidden Magic: Noad Nepesh.
 I'll be sure to work slower and  much more carefully next time.
 In an era where you two don't exist.
 Secré!
 Are you all right?
 My prince!
 So you managed to seal the devil.
 But the seal that I put on  the devil will eventually...
 Prince!
 No...
 This is how it should be.
 I was able to keep my promise to Licht.
 So...
 My prince, I'm going to use  the magic stones to seal you.
 It probably won't be complete, but it  should be enough to keep you alive.
 If the devil's seal is broken,
 the peaceful future we sought  will be taken away from us.
 Secré, don't. If you use  any more forbidden magic,
 you'll lose your humanity.
 I cannot let you die here, Your Highness.
 As Licht said, you are our hope for the future.
 Several Years Later
 The prince began his long  slumber in the form of a statue,
 and for some reason, I turned into a bird.
 I've been spared? But in this form...
 I'll need the help of the future mages.
 Five hundred years ago, I was  excluded from the natural realm.
 I started preparing for the day that  the devil's seal would be broken
 as I watched over Licht's  five-leaf grimoire.
 And the one who ended up with that grimoire...
 was a boy who was born without magic.
 There was a sign that things were in motion,
 but once the wheel started turning,  it proceeded quickly.
 And finally, that day has come.
 Today, we put an end to this long fight!
 There you are, you creepy bastard!
 Well, well... To think you were  able to undo his dark elf form.
 I have no interest in toys  I'm done playing with, though.
 I'm surprised this anti-magic
 was able to undo this spell that  craves the life of whoever it touches.
 It's far more annoying than  I could've ever imagined.
 It's been five hundred years  since we last met, devil!
 Unbelievable! To think I'd also  be reuniting with you two.
 Wait, Yuno, is that...
 Yeah...
 The legendary first Wizard King?
 Are you the real deal?!
 But wait, you can move?!  Wait, what the heck is going on?!
 Calm down, Asta.
 Now's really not the time for that.
 Wh-What?!
 Who are they?
 An elf revived by forbidden magic
 and Magic Knights from  this era who helped with
 gathering the magic stones  and protecting the kingdom.
 That lady's ki seems kinda familiar.
 Prince, we need to help Licht first.
 Probably due to the forbidden spell,  he was reincarnated with his soul intact.
 His soul is indeed here,  but he's not fully awakened.
 Licht... Will you be able to wake him up?
 Leave it to me.
 Once, my magic could only  open and close things.
 But after spending time with the prince,
 it started to evolve as we  pursued further opportunities.
 The prince was a genius at figuring  out the best potential for my magic.
 My sealing magic in its current  state can release any seal!
 Licht...
 I can finally say
 the words I wasn't able to say back then.
 Thank you, Lumiere.
 Well, it's a good thing you  made it in time in this era.
 You had a rather unfortunate  farewell five hundred years ago.
 This time, I'll get rid of both of you at once.
 Licht...
 Patry, I saw everything from  within my soul's deep slumber.
 Licht, I...
 Five hundred years ago, we lost  to this devil's scheme.
 While I was drowning in despair,
 the one who kept me from hurting  even more innocent people
 and causing even more despair
 was Lumiere.
 Regardless of how it was done,
 it appears that someone came to stop you, too.
 Patry, even though you believed the  blade you wielded was for justice,
 for those who were struck by your blade,  it was an unforgivable crime.
 Still, even if you cannot be forgiven,
 let me just say this...
 I know you did your best.
 Licht...
 What we can do right now
 is fight against the next tragedy
 that's about to occur without letting  our mistakes break our spirits.
 Let us finally put an end  to our five hundred years.
 Yes, indeed.
 I'll swallow up your trivial little feelings,  and that'll be the end of it.
 Light Magic: Mana Zone...
 Lamp of Avior-Gloria.
 Sword Magic: Origin Flash-Rampage.
 They managed to blow apart my magic,  which devours this world's magic.
 The one who used the most forbidden spell,
 and the one who absorbed all his magic...
 In other words, they've been  affected by that world.
 They're fast!
 H-Holy crap...
 If our attacks continue at  this speed and power...
 He won't be able to counter  with his word soul magic.
 They did it!
 Douve Nuutra Edde!
 My prince!
 Lumiere!
 That spear... It breaks down spells.
 I commend you for being able  to attack me this much.
 But no matter how powerful you may be,
 you will not be able to kill me now  that I have my body and grimoire!
 Not happening!
 Anti-magic?
 As I thought...
 Maybe with anti-magic...
 This spear can break down  anything it touches, but he...
 But alone, he's nothing to fear.
 ""Get back.""
 ""Storm of Blades.""
 Thanks, everyone!
 His magic is overwhelmingly vast...
 But it doesn't feel oppressive at all.
 It's like a well-honed blade.
 So this is the awakened elf leader.
 But what is this warm and nostalgic  feeling that seems to be embracing me?
 My prince! Your arm!
 I will close the wound and seal the damage.
 Sealing Magic: Closed Sorrow.
 Thanks, Secré.
 That's so freakin' cool!
 As I'd expect from a friend  of the first Wizard King!
 But, uh... Somehow, I don't feel like  this is the first time we're meeting.
 Hrm...
 Like, your ki, your atmosphere,
 and your eyes really remind  me of someone I know...
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! What's  the big idea?! Ow, ow, ow!
 Focus on the fight.
 That ability of yours is rather convenient.  It did manage to seal me, after all.
 For magic of this world, which is  like a weed and not even powerful
 like four-leaf magic, that is.
 Though now that I have my body,  it's just stunted and worthless magic.
 Be quiet.
 My prince managed to find  possibilities even in magic like mine.
 He showed me that there was  something even I could do!
 I have a four-leaf grimoire and light magic,
 so people say that my magic is amazing,
 but I just think we're all different,  and we're all pretty amazing.
 But my magic can only open and close things.
 It's practically useless.
 What did I tell you?
 I'm sure there are plenty of  uses for your sealing magic
 that you haven't discovered yet.
 There are opportunities for everyone,  and things that only they can do.
 Something only I can do?
 Just like the magic items  we're making right now...
 If everyone tried to use  their powers for everyone,
 I think this would be a wonderful kingdom.
 You exist only to steal from others!
 The ones you looked down on,  stomped on, and made a mockery of
 are going to defeat you today!
 Then you should probably hurry it up.
 No matter how much you blow away this magic,
 it will keep flowing until you defeat me.
 Since the exit is on this top floor,
 all of your friends in the lower levels
 will be swallowed up and die  if you keep wasting time.
 You bastard!
 But even Licht and Lumiere's  magic wasn't able to defeat him.
 Anything but a full-fledged attack  on our part will be useless.
 But of course.
 We will rid this place of this accursed magic
 with a mighty blow made with  the help of our friends.
 Licht!
 I'll be borrowing your strength.
 Tch. This seemed like  a good idea at the time.
 Hey, you're far too close to me, human.
 Can't you make this space wider?
 Are you being serious right now?
 I just saved your ass,  and that's how you thank me?
 You're totally still the Prickly Queen,  despite being someone else inside.
 Damn it. At this rate, it's just going to
 chip away at my magic until it's all gone.
 The only bright side to all this
 is the fact that you can use  recovery magic. Damn it...
 You have some nerve. And when I  was kind enough to heal you...
 Wait, uh... Why the hell are you shining?
 You're blinding me!
 This is...
 That's what you get for  wasting my precious food!
 Behold the power of appetite!
 Licht...
 And now, you will face the  true wrath of the elves.
 Ultimate Sword Magic: Demon-Dweller  Sword-Conquering Eon!
 Holy crap!
 His magic is on a completely  different level.
 We did it.
 You're so amazing, Licht!
 That's... the devil's heart?
 ""Heal.""
 I told you! You cannot kill me.
 Not with magic from this world.
 He can still regenerate,  despite how powerful that spell was?
 How are we supposed to...
 That's the true power of that sword.
 Is there still some power I haven't  unlocked in my own sword?
 There might still be a possibility!
 I couldn't erase that spear,  but I was able to block it!
 In that case, it's just that my anti-magic  was weak, but it was still effective!
 If I can fight like them...
 There's a power I can use  because I've got no magic!
 I have no magic.
 But that's exactly why there's  a power only I can use!
 Not yet! I'm not done yet!
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 119: ""The Final Attack.""
 Page 119   The Final Attack
 Yuno! Let's shut that guy up together!

119,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demon.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 His name was Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.
 He would eventually be called the first  Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The Final Attack
 What was that shaking just now?
 Did something happen up above?
 What in the world are these  creepy crawly things, anyway?
 If not for Gueldre's transparency magic,  we would've been done for immediately.
 Not to mention, there are  ridiculously powerful
 mages lurking everywhere around here.
 I knew I shouldn't have come here.
 There's always some danger  in anything you do.
 But we need to get out of here  before I run out of mana.
 Where's the exit?
 Licht's ultimate spell...
 Those things just couldn't  bear it any longer.
 How crazy strong is that spell, anyway?
 It pretty much saved our asses, though.
 But we ended up way further down.
 Thanks for fixing my arm, Prickly Queen.
 Now we're even.
 I can probably manage another Dimension Slash.
 I can feel the evil mana and  ki even this far away...
 So you're telling me that  insane attack wasn't enough?
 I wanna hurry up and get back there,
 but jumping in without  a plan isn't a great idea.
 I'm not sure why, but my darkness  magic works against that devil.
 If I can get the chance to  land a final blow on him...
 I think the only other one who stands a chance
 is our lively little kid.
 The sword that boy is using... That's Licht's.
 After Licht's grimoire became
 a five-leaf grimoire that  could be used by devils,
 it apparently acquired anti-magic  from a different devil.
 Crap... There's too much power!
 You clearly don't have control.
 He just shattered a spear  from the other world.
 Its effects can trap light magic and  warp space, and it even ignored that!
 I don't know what devil this power belongs to,
 but you need to learn your  place in the pecking order!
 Word Soul Magic...
 ""Voizuiinemidoren...""
 ""Futogerueofu...""
 ""Snoittnedeidoog.""
 Thank you for—
 First Wizard King!
 Light Magic: Light Swords of Conviction!
 Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!
 Damn it!
 As I thought, our magic has no  effect against the devil's magic.
 Even though we also have four-leaf  magic, he's on another level.
 The only thing I can do right now...
 I should be able to do it...
 This time, not to hurt others...
 but to protect!
 Demon Light Magic:  Light Swords of Conviction!
 Yes!
 You may be rotten now, but you're  still an elf chosen by the four-leaf.
 Not bad at all,
 though it's all for naught, of course.
 I should be able to do... what everyone  else is doing with their magic!
 So should I make it take  shape... and hold it there?
 Are you all right, Your Highness?
 Ow, ow, ow...
 Anti-magic sure is something!
 I don't think I'll be able  to use magic for a while.
 So you're not all right, then.
 There's little chance it'll work...
 But I'll use my sealing magic to bind it,  and then I'll try to control it.
 No.
 I'm sure it'll be fine.
 Why are you taking forever  over there, Asta?
 If you can't even use your  power to its full extent,
 then you've still got a long way to go...
 before you can become the Wizard King!
 Yu...no?
 He used the wind to condense the dregs of  our magic, which had returned to the air,
 and managed to create a sword from it  that should work on the devil's spells.
 And that's since our battle started.  His growth is incredibly fast!
 Wind Spirit Creation Magic:  Spirit of Zephyr.
 Hey, I was just about to get it, okay?!
 See? You can do it if you try.
 Yeah. Because...
 I'm gonna be the Wizard King!
 Anti-Magic Demon-Slayer Sword:  Black Divider!
 Unbelievable!
 How are they able to evolve so fast?
 A wind attribute and sword magic?
 I see. So he's...
 But who's the boy using the five-leaf grimoire?
 A foolish little boy who was born without  any magic and doesn't know his place.
 He worked harder than anyone in this  kingdom and never knew when to give up.
 He truly is a foolish boy.
 Did you see that, Yuno, you jerk?!
 I managed to give it shape, but I doubt  I'm gonna last long at all!
 Make sure you last until we cut him down, Asta!
 I'll finish this in an instant!
 I'll admit, you're rather lively.
 But do you think you'll be able  to reach me at that speed?
 He became even faster...  because of the wind magic.
 The anti-magic pursued the wind, and the  wind magic raced through the void.
 What a magnificent combination!
 They... did it?
 You trash...
 How dare you?
 Really, how dare you?
 You filthy maggot with no magic...
 I'm done with this.
 Despair and resistance are  merely my playthings.
 It's over. I'll kill you all.
 This can't be...
 You're nothing more than a ripple in a pond.
 My powers...
 I pierced his heart... but it just  appeared somewhere else?
 ""Voizuiinemidoren.""
 ""Futogerueofu.""
 ""Snoittnedeidoog.""
 I'll make sure to exterminate  every single last one of you.
 That devil's actually getting serious.
 At this rate, he's going  to swallow up everything!
 Come on, you can't be serious!
 We can't even get close to this thing now.
 This is proving difficult even for  those of us who can stand against him.
 At this rate, everyone down below...
 Patry...
 Sorry, but I'll need you to  hold the perimeter for a bit.
 We cannot let the people of the present die.
 They are the mages who carry the future  of the Clover Kingdom, after all.
 You're nothing more than a lump  of meat! Foolish and useless!
 Goodbye.
 I'll kill all of you.
 I'll slaughter all of you.
 Humanity is finished.
 Bring down the curtain.
 Who said you get to end this, you dark,  creepy freak covered in mouths?!
 You still good to go, Yuno?
 That's my line, Asta!
 Let's shut that guy up!
 You're no better than vomit.
 You just swarm grossly in front of me.
 And yet you
 had the nerve to bite me.
 Die.
 You'll have to pay with your deaths.
 No other way.
 You're just maggots hiding under a rock.
 I'll twist off your arms and legs.
 I'll rot your mana and lives, then kill you.
 Die!
 Die!
 Die!
 Die!
 Die!
 Die!
 Because the anti-magic is so effective on him...
 That's why he avoided that attack to his heart
 and why that damage has gotten him so furious.
 If we can get Asta's sword to  actually pierce his heart...
 Damn it! There's no end to this!
 Crap! My body's nearing its limit...
 The anti-magic boy,
 and the wind-magic boy he's fighting  alongside, who he trusts so much...
 We must leave this in their hands.
 We'll go save their friends.
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe!
 It's almost time...
 Soon I'll be able to sever  her healing magic, too!
 Wait a sec!
 We really shouldn't be fighting here right now!
 Nozel! Mimosa!
 This place is about to be  flooded with inhuman magic!
 Evacuate immediately, all of you!
 Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium Barrage!
 Lady Mereoleona, too?
 To think magic like this even existed...
 The world certainly is vast!
 La! What's all this yucky-looking stuff?!
 It's getting even more intense!
 Not good!
 It's going to swallow me up!
 The Demon-Dweller Sword bestows
 and stores up magic for those who have  bonds with each other, and connects them.
 Since my magic has a chance against the devil,
 we'll send it through the  sword to everyone else.
 Combo Spell: Demon-Dweller Sword  ~ Protecting Light!
 What is this?
 This is Licht and your prince's magic.
 Prince?
 My connection with Licht shows  me what's going on up above.
 Looks like the prince got  to have a touching reunion.
 He's making me jealous.
 As long as my magic lasts, I won't  let a single one of them die!
 Demon Light Creation Magic:  Light Whip of Judgment!
 The bond between them...
 I won't doubt it this time!
 As long as we have this light,  we can concentrate on attacking!
 Hey, what's with that light? No fair, Yuno!
 You just need to concentrate on finishing  the devil, you one-and-done moron.
 I know that, you multi-talented,  handsome jerk!
 It's so much fun when you die pathetically.
 Your sword still hasn't reached me.
 It's utterly useless.
 Already...
 Right here...
 Just like this...
 Finally...
 It's over.
 You're finished.
 Again, keep your distance, human.
 Hey, you still owe me from earlier. Let me in.
 By the way, you said you can see  what's going on above, right?
 I was just thinking that having nothing
 but mana detection and ki  to rely on is really unsafe.
 Tell me what that creepy thing  is doing, Prickly Queen.
 You can't possibly be... From here?
 I don't like how you asked,
 but I'll at least add momentum to your strike.
 Don't you dare miss!
 Yeah.
 We'll do an all-out attack...
 and finish this!
 At first, I only got close to  you so that I could use you.
 You coincidentally managed to obtain
 the five-leaf grimoire that kept magic away.
 A boy with no magic...
 But the longer I stayed with you, and the more I saw you fight,
 the more I wanted to believe in you.
 I wanted to bet on you!
 Please...
 Win this, Asta!
 This light... I can feel my power welling forth.
 Is Asta at his limit?
 Asta, I'm gonna leave you  behind if you can't keep up!
 Where do you think you're going, Yuno?!
 You're just a human.
 Yet you're using spirit power
 and elven powers...
 To fight my magic...
 But you cannot pierce my heart with that wind.
 That anti-magic brat  is merely letting himself
 be pulled along, following that  wind magic. He's hopeless.
 And he isn't even following properly.
 They're nothing to worry about... hmm?
 Where'd the anti-magic brat go?
 He hid in the shadows of the severed magic!
 He's in my blind spot, coming from  a different direction!
 They're pulling each other in and speeding up!
 ""Sto—""
 ""Stop.""
 ""Weaken!""
 ""Go back!""
 ""Hold back!""
 ""Stop!""
 I reached my... limit?
 Asta!
 Too bad!
 His... His concentration is astounding!
 But it's still not possible.  Not from this distance!
 You sure about this?
 Making a foreigner like me a  Magic Knights Squad captain?
 Don't worry. I'm sure you'll do fine.
 I mean, I'm gonna do whatever I want.
 I'm sure the higher-ups aren't gonna like this.
 Just because my magic's a bit rare...
 I know.
 Because I've watched you all this time.
 Yami...
 I know you can do this.
 Mana Zone...
 Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash ~ Equinox!
 Equinox
 Dark magic can interfere with the other world!
 This ki...
 It's... Captain Yami!
 You maggots!
 Sealing Recovery Magic... Heavenly Prison: Faint Omen.
 I've sealed his physical damage.
 Now it's just a question of whether he  can draw out his anti-magic power.
 Asta!
 Die!
 Perish!
 Disappear!
 You go ahead and do that!
 You pieces of trash!
 Asta...
 You're going to be...
 You're going to be the Wizard King, right?
 Yeah!
 Right here, right now...
 I'll surpass my limits!
 Asta... Did we do it?
 This is exactly why you're my rival!
 The Shadow Palace is starting to crumble?

121,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demon.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 His name was Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.
 He would eventually be called the first  Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Heya. I somehow survived.
 Though I'm a bit smaller now.
 Yami...
 I leave the rest to you...
 Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, no. You definitely died.
 That was definitely leading up to you dying.
 That was, like, your end.
 Weren't you leaving everything  to me or something?
 Could you give me back my determination?
 Yami, you're being a bit scary.
 Sorry I was so useless when the  kingdom was in such danger.
 I thought my magic would kick in sooner, but...
 Magic?
 It's probably about thirteen years' worth...
 I'd stored time into a certain magic item.
 I had to take a bet on whether  it'd actually activate or not.
 Damn it...
 You're such a crazy old man.
 But I got to see your face when  I thought I never would again.
 I guess that's not so bad.
 Master Julius...
 I... I...
 William Vangeance. No matter  what the reason may have been,
 betraying the kingdom is a grave crime.
 Many were hurt,
 and it will take time for  everyone to recover.
 I'm not going to let you  sit idle during that time.
 Wait, aren't you going kinda easy on him?
 After everything he did,  you're not gonna punish him at all?
 Well, I'm the one who invited  William into the Magic Knights
 and appointed him as a captain.
 I'm responsible for what happened, too...
 and for losing against the  other soul that was in him,
 the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 William, I'm sure there will  be those who resent you
 for being a part of all of this.
 But I know how much you suffered, too.
 Do you have the resolve to  withstand that hatred and proceed?
 I pledge my grimoire once again  to you, and to the kingdom.
 This time, for good.
 For crying out loud, this guy...
 He may have shrunk, but he  hasn't changed one bit.
 Three Problems
 Now, then...
 All of you worked very hard.
 The battle has ended, and now  we can live happily ever after.
 Or so I'd like to say,
 but currently, we have three problems.
 Who is this guy? He called  us here out of the blue.
 He's just a kid.
 What a snotty little brat.
 I swear I've sensed this  mana somewhere before...
 Captain Yami! This ki... Don't tell me he's...
 The first problem.
 The Wizard King is gone.
 He's standing right here.
 That's you, remember?
 What?!
 What?! I knew it!
 Most of my magic is now gone.
 This is all that's left of my grimoire,
 which means I won't be able to fight,
 and my influence on the hard-line  monarchist nobles who prioritize the wealth
 and power of this kingdom  has been weakened.
 Ooh, me! Me, me, me!
 How did you get so small, and why  are you alive, Wizard King?!
 Mister Energy really doesn't hold back at all.
 Well, you see, during my  incognito wanderings, I found
 magic storage technology left  behind by some ancient mages.
 According to some documents  I found in the castle's library,
 it's called Swallowtail.
 My time magic and Swallowtail  were very compatible.
 I stored my time and magic into the  emblem on my forehead little by little.
 Time that would let me start over  in case something happened to me.
 But I didn't get to start over immediately,  and I only made it as far as this age.
 Guess things don't always go as planned.
 Uh, this is plenty. You don't  usually get do-overs in life.
 You're insane, you old man  who looks like a kid.
 Secré! We did it!
 We've finally completed our first prototype!
 We're now one step closer
 to the peaceful, fair world that  you so long to create, Your Highness.
 It's all thanks to you, Secré.
 You seem to think that your magic  isn't useful, but that's not true.
 Your Highness...
 I came up with a name for this magic item...
 But it's still a secret, Secré Swallowtail.
 My prince, our magic item  has survived all this time
 and saved the life of someone  who carries on your legacy.
 I'm just so glad that  you're alive, Wizard King!
 Thank you. I see that you're  as lively as ever, Asta.
 I heard you did a great job yet again.
 I did my best! But I've  still got a long way to go!
 As for Noelle and Mimosa,
 I can imagine how much you must have risked your own lives
 in this endeavor just by how  much your mana has grown.
 Yes, sir!
 And as for our guest that  I don't recognize...
 What kind of magic do you use?!
 My many years of incognito  wandering tell me
 you definitely use some unique kind of magic!
 Yeah, yeah. Get on with  your explanation already.
 We need to hurry out there  and help the others.
 Sorry about that.
 I see the Wizard King hasn't changed.
 He sure hasn't.
 He's definitely the same.
 So what's the remaining two  of these three problems?
 I'm trying to keep those two  secret as much as possible.
 But I predict that, at this rate,
 the Clover Kingdom will be destroyed  by the surrounding countries.
 You mean...
 The Diamond Kingdom and the other ones?!
 Or Asta dies.
 What?!
 Asta?!
 Wh-Why, though?!
 Wait, why is either the Clover Kingdom  going to be destroyed or I just die?!
 Or it could even be both.
 His predictions are pretty spot-on, too.
 Sucks to be you, kid. Namu.
 Why are we going forward with me dying?!
 What the heck is going on, Wizard King?!
 Asta, a devil is the source of your black power.
 A d-devil?
 Just like that creepy, black guy?
 I mean, when I use my black  powers, it feels similar, but...
 A devil?
 So that form Asta takes...
 It really was similar to the one Granny  told us about when we were kids.
 Is your body okay using powers like that?
 I'm totally fine! Though my whole  body hurts like hell afterward!
 I wouldn't call that fine, Asta.
 A devil? Wow, talk about creepy. Gross.
 Back off, man.
 Captain Yami! You don't know how much  your words can hurt people sometimes!
 Your black horn is proof that humans  ventured into a forbidden realm
 and involved themselves in  a world beyond this one.
 It's a curse known as weg.
 There appear to be other  Magic Knights who have similar curses.
 Other than me?
 U-Um...
 A world beyond ours?
 I don't have all the details, but it's  said that the devils live there.
 And the five-leaf grimoire that  one devil failed to obtain
 has another devil inhabiting it.
 You're...
 So your horns are...
 Five hundred years ago,
 I fell under the curse of forbidden  magic in order to seal the devil.
 The curse and my magic mingled,  and this happened.
 I can switch forms as I choose now.
 Nero's talking! How adorable!
 That's amazing! This seems different  from transformation magic!
 So you're sealing yourself  into the form of that bird!
 To think the penalty for  forbidden magic would overlap with
 unusual magic to produce a result like this.
 Ancient magic is truly fascinating!
 Uh, so, Wizard King...  What's this about m-me dying?!
 Is the devil going to explode or something?!
 Oh, sorry about that.
 First, there are three kingdoms  surrounding the Clover Kingdom.
 There's Diamond, an aggressor  kingdom that has a powerful army
 Aggressor Kingdom Diamond
 thanks to their magic scholars, and has  no problem with experimenting on humans.
 Heart is an unseen, neutral kingdom  of mystery that takes in and uses
 Kingdom of Mystery Heart
 its abundant natural mana,  perfecting its own unique magic.
 And then there's the Spade Kingdom.
 Demon Kingdom Spade
 A kingdom of winter, mysteries, and demons  that is served by the ancient evils
 that sleep in its vast, frigid land,  and is attempting to gain supremacy.
 Like Diamond, our immediate neighbor,
 Spade Kingdom
 Diamond  Kingdom
 Clover Kingdom
 the Spade Kingdom is attempting  to extend its influence across
 Heart  Kingdom
 the strong magic region that separates us.
 But currently, the Magic Knights  that defend our kingdom
 have grown exhausted like never before.
 Not only that, but some turned against us,
 even if just for a moment,  because of the reincarnations.
 That currently puts them on shaky ground.
 Not to mention what Julius  looks like right now.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait!
 It wasn't any of their faults, though!
 They were taken over by elves!
 Or rather, it was all because of  that ""Hur hur hur"" devil guy!
 Which means we need people to know that
 they were just being  manipulated by that devil!
 Exactly. And so the Magic Parliament  will probably put the power
 of your devil on trial to find it guilty.
 After all, a peasant who uses the  powers of an unknown devil as you do
 is a perfect scapegoat to  take the fall for everyone.
 No way! But I haven't done anything wrong!
 What the heck's this Magic Parliament, anyway?!
 You seriously don't know about that?
 The Magic Parliament is made up of  royalty and nobles who create laws
 and conduct trials for significant crimes.
 They are one of the highest  authorities in this kingdom.
 And one of the three great royal  families stands at its center.
 The House of Kira.
 The current king's royal family,  which has the most authority.
 Well done! Excellent work protecting me!
 Member of the Green Praying Mantises,  Sekke Bronzazza!
 Bah-ha?
 You're only a commoner,  but you did fine work!
 So this is what Julius meant when he  said that even the lowliest had potential!
 The Green Praying Mantises Squad  is nothing but commoners,
 and your captain is downright psychotic,  so I never liked him, but well done!
 What the heck's going on?
 All hell broke loose in the royal capital,
 so I was trying to get the hell out...
 Bah-ha?! The king?!
 Y-Y-Y-You're not dead, are you?!
 This isn't my fault, is it?!
 So this all just happened by coincidence.
 Your Majesty...
 With my newly-awakened, true powers,  it was a piece of cake!
 Such a brave young lad!
 My luck's been crap ever since I met  that brat at the Entrance Exam,
 but now, my comeback success  story is about to start!
 That's the star I was born under!
 There he is.
 There's a Magic Knight with him,
 but he's a low-ranking one that won't give us any problems.
 Augustus Kira, we've come for you life!
 Who the hell are you?!
 Wait... What the hell, bah-ha?
 You don't need to know that.
 This will all be blamed on the  Eye of the Midnight Sun, anyway.
 Die!
 I have no idea what's going on...
 But I'm counting on you, Sekke!
 Bah-ha?!
 I barely have any magic left!
 My magic... it shrank!
 You anti-monarchist nobles,
 taking advantage of the kingdom and  castle's crisis to harm the king...
 You...
 are evil.
 Kneel!
 What the hell kind of magic is that?!
 I can't... move.
 You're... from the House of Kira.
 Are you all right, Your Majesty?
 I certainly am not all right, Damnatio!
 My clothes are filthy!
 Speaking of filthy, this reaction...
 So it finally appeared.
 In the name of the royal family...  In the name of justice...
 Damnatio Kira
 I swear I will condemn you,
 devil-possessed wretch!
 Several days later,
 the royal capital, after being  destroyed by the elves' attack,
 was steadily being rebuilt under the  leadership of Fuegoleon and Nozel.
 Smiles were finally returning  to the people's faces.
 And as for Asta and the others...
 Come on, eat up! Miz Charmy's  food will recover your mana, too!
 You must be Asta!
 I heard you did great in the battle the  other day! I'm honored to meet you!
 Nah, it wasn't that big of a deal.
 Wait, who are you?
 Oh, I do apologize.
 I work with the Magic Parliament.
 Hey, those are the guys the  Wizard King mentioned.
 Would you mind testifying before us  about what happened during the battle?
 We want to know the truth.
 The truth?
 That's our duty, after all.
 Ah, the mysterious maiden!
 You should also join us  and tell us what happened.
 Okay, let's go, Nero!
 What?
 Asta, wait. What are you—
 It'll be fine! They seem like  a bunch of reasonable guys.
 Besides, we'll be the best ones  to explain what happened
 with the elves and the devil,
 and how the reincarnation  spell was broken.
 Magic Parliament Courthouse
 Please step inside.
 I'm getting super nervous!
 Your position is compromised  because of your black power.
 Don't let your guard down.
 We managed to get through to the elves.
 We'll be able to work this out  as long as we get to talk.
 What the heck is this?!
 Who is that?
 He's so vulgar and rowdy.
 Who knows what he would do  if we didn't handcuff him?
 The pillar of legislation and  justice for the Clover Kingdom,
 the Magic Parliament.
 I am the chairman, Damnatio Kira,
 and I shall pass judgment  upon Asta of the Black Bulls.
 Th-This isn't what we talked about!
 You're already treating me like a criminal!
 Looks like we fell right into their trap.
 My eyes didn't deceive me.
 I knew that brat was up to no good.
 Precisely!
 I don't know what he's guilty of,  but take that, bah-ha!
 And after I let you into the  Royal Knights! You ungrateful wretch!
 Asta of the Black Bulls...
 From the church in Hage Village  that lies in the Forsaken Realm.
 You are a peasant,
 an orphan, and I cannot feel  an ounce of magic from you.
 The Forsaken Realm?!
 Goodness!
 Filthy little peasant.
 And you, girl...
 Hey... Those horns...
 The kingdom has no record of her birth,
 and her horns are proof that  she has dabbled in forbidden magic.
 Forbidden?! How vile!
 They testify that this disturbance  was caused by a devil
 who ensnared and controlled  the Magic Knights.
 That's right!
 The Magic Knights were possessed  because of that devil!
 D-Devil?!
 Bah... ha? Uh, this is turning  into a bigger mess than I expected.
 Peasants can't be trusted.
 How uncouth! He may be a Magic Knight,  but he's from the Black Bulls.
 Aren't those horns a sign that  she sold her soul to the devil?
 That must be it!
 Wizard King Julius worked so hard...
 And yet there's still this much  prejudice and discrimination.
 So much that it's dimming  Asta's determination
 to make us all understand each other.
 Their kind has always been the only  kind of people that gather here.
 Hey, listen to me!
 I'm not lying!
 In this trial, either you were  going to be convicted as a devil
 or the Magic Knights were going to pay for  their sins. Those were the only two options.
 And you can't abandon other people.
 The scales reveal that you are
 simple, impulsive, and dealt with easily.
 A single peasant,
 or the cornerstone of the  kingdom's defense, the Magic Knights.
 It's obvious which way the sales will tip.
 I wonder where this devil  that you speak of is.
 I told you! We defeated him!
 Nero worked hard for so  long to make it happen!
 Everyone here suspects that you are
 the ones who are truly in  communication with the devil.
 No! The one in my grimoire is—
 Anything you say right now  will just get warped.
 Revealing the black power is too risky.
 If there is no devil, we'll just have  to pass judgment on everyone in turn.
 Bring her in.
 Marie?!
 Asta!
 This is Marie Adlai.
 She was a daughter of the House of Adlai,
 but she is now a ruined noble  who lives in a church with orphans.
 Her older brother is an ex-convict.
 We have determined that, during the  recent great battle, her eye magic
 caused indirect harm to  Magic Knights and the citizenry.
 Quit making things up!
 Marie didn't do any of that on purpose!
 Indeed.
 If a devil truly exists,  there's no doubt she was manipulated.
 But if there is no proof of that,
 all that remains are her undeniable crimes.
 Therefore...
 She must be judged!
 In the name of justice!
 Stop!
 I-I'm...
 You are evil.
 Guilty!
 You've made it loud and  clear how you operate.
 Look at him!
 There's no way in hell I'm going  to acknowledge your justice!
 And we won't even attempt to reach  an understanding with a devil.
 Damnatio tends to be very  serious and stubborn,
 so he probably won't let Asta  off the hook that easily.

 What? To the royal capital again?
 Yes. I do apologize, as I realize  she just came back, but...
 Here is the order.
 It appears to be real, but...
 Do not worry.
 We'll make sure she gets there safely.
 As soon as Marie returns from battle, she's summoned to the capital again?
 Theresa Rapual
 Neige
 What could the Magic Parliament want with her?
 Sister Theresa!
 What's the matter, Rebecca?
 Rebecca Scarlet
 There's trouble. Here, look at today's paper.
 Church, Hage Village
 Th-Th-The paper...
 Orsi Orfai
 Asta's in the paper!
 Lily Aquaria
 ""Rebelling Against the Kingdom...  A Minion of the Devil""?!
 This must be some kind of mistake!
 The Royal Capital, Clover Kingdom
 So that peasant brat  finally became a criminal!
 Revchi
 Gueldre Poizot
 Sucks to be him!
 Ooh!
 Does that mean Asta will have to work here, too?
 Sally
 That means I get to dissect him, right?
 I mean, he promised me that I could.
 Rades Spirito
 Hell if I know!
 Jeez, why are you so angry?
 I'm not angry!
 Your blood is always boiling.
 I know. Maybe if I took some  of your blood, that'd help.
 I'll just dissect you!
 Don't!
 Why do I have to do this, anyway?
 Hey, what the hell is going on, Valtos?!
 Valtos
 Don't ask me.
 You're the one who followed me.
 I just decided that I would atone for my sins.
 Damn it!
 Captain of the Green Praying Mantises Jack the Ripper
 Shut it! Start yappin' again and  I'll slice you, criminals!
 You already did!
 Are you trying to kill us?!
 You bastard!
 Of course I am!
 If I'd had my way, I would've turned you all into sliced ham while you were roaming free!
 Go ahead and run! That'd give me an excuse to slice you up!
 You can't be serious! You look more  like a criminal than any of us!
 I'm gonna control your corpse one day!
 I'll tie you up in chains!
 Shut up!
 Asta...
 This is... Are they trying to make Asta  take the blame for everything we did?
 Damnatio from the Magic Parliament  just might do that.
 They say that he judged his own father before.
 He's the scale of justice that will  cruelly judge any crime for the sake of
 the kingdom and the law.
 So Asta's up against the jurisdiction  of this kingdom itself.
 If anyone defies it, their entire  clan will be punished.
 Magic Parliament Courthouse
 That form is truly...
 It's just as the legends describe.
 He's a devil!
 So you've shown your true self,
 you devil!
 I'm able to go into my black form quicker now.
 After that last fight, I've managed  to make it more my own.
 Asta...
 Don't you worry, Marie. I'll protect you.
 Okay.
 Everyone, listen!
 It's okay! I'm able to control this power now!
 I won't attack any of you!
 Like we can actually believe you!
 You're possessed by a devil!
 How grotesque!
 How horrifying!
 You're a filthy peasan  who's made a deal with the devils!
 Give him death!
 I knew he was nothing more than trash.
 A devil...
 Nothing is more suitable than the death  penalty for peasant filth like him.
 Bah-ha?! The death penalty?!
 Please! Listen to me!
 Kill him! Before he brings misfortune upon the kingdom!
 Sentence him to death immediately!
 Give yourself up.
 Even if you were able to defeat me and escape from here,
 you'd just become a fugitive.
 There's nowhere for you to run.
 And if that were to happen,
 the ones who raised you in the church  will probably suffer, too.
 You should be convicted right here, right now.
 By having someone as  dangerous as you disappear,
 that little girl, as well as many  Magic Knights, will be saved.
 There is no one in this place nor this kingdom who can or will save you right now.
 You sow calamity over everyone you touch.
 You are evil.
 What's going on?!
 What is the meaning of this?!
 Man... I knew you guys would be  doing whatever the hell you wanted.
 I was told the trial would  be two days from now.
 I don't give a rat's ass  if that kid is evil or not.
 He's definitely a badass junior of mine that
 I've acknowledged as a real man's man.
 He's my precious friend.
 I can't let you kill him right here.
 What do you think you're  doing to my best friend?
 Do you all want to get cursed to death?
 I've transformed into him,
 so I know that he's always bold, and I'd  love to be as persistent as he is.
 He's... really, really... nice...
 and... a good... boy.
 Losing you would make Marie sad,
 so I guess I don't mind  saving you along with her.
 Also, get your paws off Marie!
 He may be a boy,
 but he's a very brave young man that
 makes even the cruelest fates  bounce off of him.
 He makes me look good as his senior,  and I couldn't ask for a better partner!
 I still need him to live  longer and eat more noms!
 He's a stupid little shrimp,
 but I don't mind conceding a little bit
 and saying he's pretty close to  what a true Magic Knight should be.
 He's stupid, loud, and reckless,
 but as royalty, I acknowledge him  as someone this kingdom needs!
 N-Not that there's any deeper meaning to that.
 How about you guys give back...
 ...Asta now?
 The Black Bulls...
 Wh-What in the world is that giant thing?
 Th-The Black Bulls?
 How dare you disturb this honorable  trial with such violence?!
 Yami Sukehiro...
 You're defending the criminal  that started this great war?
 Do you know what will happen to the  Black Bulls because of this decision?
 Oh, you didn't know?
 We're pretty much the worst Magic  Knight squad ever to exist.
 Both those guys there with the  horns belong to our squad.
 Me?
 If you're gonna mess with them,
 we'll be scoundrels or rebels  or whatever, you jackass!
 Guys...
 That aside, I'm gonna punish  anyone who dares to touch Marie.
 B-Big Brother! Now's not the time for that!
 How stupid can you be to come  out and get caught like this?
 How many times to do you intend  to almost die, Stupidsta?!
 Even death couldn't fix his stupidity.
 At least die fighting me!
 When you die is the day I die!
 How dare you hold Marie? Die, Asta.
 Wait, didn't you come to save me?!
 Big Brother, stop!
 Apparently, even death couldn't  fix his sister complex.
 Hey, guy from the royal Kira family or whatever.
 Looks like you took real good  care of two of my squad members.
 Don't worry about me. Just take  Asta and get out of here!
 I'm not even from this era, and I'm no longer  really human because of the forbidden magic.
 I basically used you to complete my mission.
 You've really got some nerve, saying that  after spending so much time at our place.
 You've been watching us this whole time,
 but apparently, you've still got no clue.
 I heard all about you.
 You were being badass in the  form of a bird for 500 years?
 That's pretty awesome.
 It... must... have... been... really...  lonely... all... by... yourself.
 I know that feeling all too well.
 We'd love to have another  cute girl like you!
 You were working hard in the shadows.
 We'd probably get along really well.
 Be my friend.
 Actually, we've been best  friends since the day I was born.
 Y-Yes!
 Now you get to enjoy life  along with all of us.
 Just make sure you eat tons!
 Thank goodness I didn't eat  you when you were a bird.
 You were planning on eating her?
 Nothing will change about  the Black Bulls if we have
 another weirdo like yourself.
 For me, your ki is really familiar,
 and we've already got plenty of weirdos.
 This is...
 Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison.
 I'll go with you!
 Yeah, we're basically as pitch black as it gets!
 That's...
 Us, the Black Bulls!
 Apparently, you don't understand at all.
 Even if you protect that devil's minions,
 it won't change the situation.
 Cause all the fuss you want here, but it won't clear the boy's name.
 It's actually just going to worsen  the charges of him being a devil.
 Apparently, you're all very emotional,  but that won't save this kingdom.
 You cannot change the minds of  all the nobles gathered here.
 They're still leaning toward  bewilderment and suspicion.
 And even if they were to rampage...
 Scale Magic: Scale Regulate!
 La! My magic's getting smaller!
 My scale magic measures one's abilities,  balances them, and establishes order.
 No matter how powerful your magic is, it's impossible to defy it.
 But Rouge hasn't disappeared.
 Meaning he can't lay a finger on us!
 And we have a boy who can make the impossible possible!
 Demon-Destroyer Sword: Fate Release!
 He erased my magic's effect!
 Gotcha!
 Oh, are they...
 You're as reckless as ever, foreigner.
 What were you planning to do after this?
 Eh, I just got a little worked up.
 Though it appears you meant to miss.
 Honestly... Even if this  was for your squad members,
 you couldn't make a worse impression.
 Though thanks to that, we made it in time.
 What the hell is that big dragon?!
 You really did power up when you came back!
 Captain Fuegoleon... Captain Nozel!
 Why...
 We can't afford to lose  any capable Magic Knights.
 In other words, the people
 who acknowledge you aren't  limited to any rank or class.
 Nozel! Captain Fuegoleon!
 Two royal members of the Magic Knights...
 What's the meaning of this?
 But what are you going to do now?
 We have a mission from the Wizard King.
 The Black Bulls Magic Knights Squad
 is tasked with locating and investigating the devils.
 Huh?
 Prove your innocence with your own hands.
 I see.
 Royals have authority here,  so he had Nozel and Fuegoleon,
 two royals, deliver the order.
 Can that geriatric kid see  the future or something?
 Curse you, Julius!
 You were missing when we  really needed you,
 and now you go stepping on my toes again!
 So I guess that means Asta  won't be executed immediately.
 Ba-hank goodness...
 While Asta is on this mission,
 the Wizard King and Magic Knights will  take full responsibility for him.
 By making it look as though the brat's  being dealt with by the Magic Knights,
 they're given the leeway  to prove their innocence.
 So, uh, er... Wait, what does that mean?
 We're gonna go investigate the devils  so we can clear that name of yours!
 And break the curse of the forbidden magic, too.
 Investigating the devils?
 But that doesn't resolve anything...
 It's an order from the Wizard King.  He wouldn't be too foolhardy.
 I mean, two royal captains of the  Magic Knights are vouching for him.
 And the Wizard King says  he'll take responsibility.
 Apparently, I weighed the trust  people have in you too lightly.
 But know that you'll be
 executed immediately if you prove  to have no use to the kingdom.
 You're still hanging in the balance.
 Let us go.
 Yes, Your Majesty.
 Marie... Thank goodness you're safe.
 Big Brother!
 I told you not to attack Asta!
 M-Marie?!
 Um... Nozel...
 Thank you very much.
 Do not thank me. Thank the Wizard King.
 I will.
 Asta, take this.
 Huh?!
 What was that?
 Now we'll know where you are.
 This way, you can't flee.
 Like I would actually try to flee!
 We know.
 But putting up a front is necessary at times.
 Do you understand?
 Yes, sir.
 Good for you, Asta.
 Jeez, don't worry us like that!
 Go on. Eat up!
 And drink up, too.
 Want more?
 I'll feed you myself, my dear friend.
 Asta...
 You dumbass.
 Uh... Um... Um...
 I-I'm gonna die!
 Come in.
 Pardon me.
 Hello, Damnatio.
 So you're trying to take on everything again,  despite what you've been reduced to.
 Both what happened with the Magic Knights,  as well as the boy possessed by a devil.
 That order was smart thinking, wasn't it?
 Now no one will get punished.
 Of course, that's how it should be,  since Asta never did anything wrong.
 I'm sure that the Black Bulls will be  able to find some clues about the devils.
 That'll make up for them  barging into the trial, too.
 Forgiving them means taking responsibility.
 The kingdom can't take that  kind of responsibility.
 You can't take on that  responsibility yourself, either.
 I didn't forgive them. I left it in their hands.
 It's not about responsibility.  It's about trusting them.
 Eventually, I'm sure your scales will  tip in favor of Asta and his group.
 It appears that you haven't changed  at all inside. I'm relieved.
 The distortions in this country...
 The crisis we're facing is not a small one.
 If the kingdom is about to fall,  I'll have to pass judgment.
 On that boy, and even you.
 Pardon me.
 Master Julius!
 Hey there, Marx.
 Feeling better already?
 You're alive, but you're little...
 You're little, but you're alive...
 Huh? Wha... I...
 I'm fine, but... What? What's going on?
 You were always like a child...
 And now, you really are a child.
 So, yeah, this...
 You don't need to explain!
 Just show me your memories later.
 The kingdom is in trouble,  and that form of yours is...
 Honestly...
 You're such a ridiculous person...
 I'm s-so glad...
 you're alive.
 I'm sorry for always worrying you, Marx.
 No, I'm not forgiving you!
 Huh?
 There's a mountain of work waiting for you!
 Wait...
 There are plenty of problems  we need you to solve.
 What?!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 There's Trouble!
 There's Trouble!
 Sister Theresa!
 What's the matter, Rebecca?
 There's trouble. Here, look at today's paper.
 Th-This is...
 Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha...
 Th-This is...
 Th-This is...
 All you people just keep saying, ""This is...""
 This is... what?!
 Nice, I say!
 On that day, five hundred years ago,
 the tragedy between the humans  and the elves happened.
 And it was all caused by a devil.
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 123:  ""Nero Reminisces... Part One.""

123,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demon.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 His name was Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.
 He would eventually be called the first  Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 Nero Reminisces...  Part One
 One of the Black Bulls, huh?
 My prince, so much has happened...
 Ever since we met on that  day 500 years ago.
 Hey there! You must be Secré.
 Sorry, I'm researching ancient  magic right now, so I can't get up.
 By the way, what kind of magic do you have?
 Sealing magic?!
 What's that? I've never heard of it before!
 That's so unusual! How amazing!
 How should we have you use it?  Just thinking about it is exciting, isn't it?
 Magical tools?
 Yup. So that people who aren't  blessed with magic or by their
 magical attribute can  use all kinds of spells.
 That way, I think we can  make our society more equal.
 But that just sounds like a silly dream.
 They're tools to help me with that.
 I think I'll call them magic items.
 I'm sure your magic will help me with this!
 For example, can you seal magic into objects?
 Um... Yes.
 You can?! That's amazing!
 I helped the prince make magical tools.
 He really was nothing like I'd imagined.
 There were members of his family  who didn't like his progressive ideas.
 But he didn't let that bother him,  and he never compromised his ideals.
 He was a strong, honest person.
 I didn't know it at the time,
 but the prince interacted with  a race other than humans.
 They were a race loved by mana,  who lived their lives in peace.
 They were the elves.
 A four-leaf grimoire!
 Licht of sword magic was chosen  by a four-leaf grimoire!
 What's a four-leaf grimoire, Mommy?
 It's a grimoire with good fortune in it.
 Only those it chooses can wield it!
 Licht, with the four-leaf grimoire...
 He's so cool!
 The three leaves of the clover  represent faith, hope, and love.
 Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.
 Within a fifth leaf...
 resides a devil.
 We thought that was just a saying.
 So what do you think, Licht?
 About the rumors that the  humans might attack us.
 I believe they're just rumors.
 But I wouldn't say it's  completely impossible.
 They're...
 Humans are a wicked-hearted race that kills animals for sport.
 That's...
 Licht!
 Sword Magic:
 Origin Flash!
 Light Magic:
 Lamp of Avior!
 Are you all right?
 Y-Yes.
 Thank you so much.
 Tetia! Why did you leave the  castle without permission?
 Brother...
 Your magical attribute is wind.
 How did you, of all people,  get caught up in a mana tornado?
 Thank you for saving my little sister.
 It's nothing...
 Phenomenal magic and skill...
 The same thoughts and ideals...
 The same four-leaf grimoires...
 The leader of the elves, Licht,
 was the first peer and friend  that the prince had ever had.
 We can come to understand each other.
 You elves have truly amazing mana.
 By combining that with the magic-item  technology that we humans created,
 we can make this land  safer and more prosperous.
 Let us live together, hand in hand.
 Through his work with the elves,  spells and magic-item technology
 that would help not only the humans,  but both races to live in peace as equals
 were slowly becoming a reality.
 The prince and Licht were best friends.
 And they were supposed to become family.
 You're with child?
 With you two as its parents, I'm sure it'll be a wonderful child!
 Congrats, Tetia... and Licht, too, I guess.
 Well, thanks, I guess.
 What? Something bothering you?
 Well...
 I guess you are still a kid.
 Be quiet! Stop treating me like a child!
 Yeah, yeah...
 Lumiere...
 Soon, I'll marry Tetia and become your brother.
 I'm sure there will be humans  who look down upon that.
 You're probably right.
 But with you...
 I'll be able to create a  peaceful and equal world.
 I truly believe that.
 I believe that, too.
 I'm sure...
 ...it was fate that brought us together.
 I'm really sorry, but I'm probably  going to be late to your wedding.
 Sadly, Father has summoned  me to the palace that day.
 I know that he and the others  are against this marriage now,
 but don't worry.
 I'm sure they'll understand someday  and give you their blessings.
 I know.
 I'm sure Licht and the others  will be eager to see you.
 But it's likely that even then,
 he was already manipulating  the whole situation.
 I wonder why Father summoned me today.
 We didn't mention the wedding  to anyone, so is it a coincidence?
 I need to hurry to the ceremony.
 Congratulations!
 I wish you both years of happiness!
 May the mana bless you!
 Thank you so much.
 Aw... I hope someday I'll also...
 I'm sure you'll meet  someone lovely soon, Fana.
 I sure hope so.
 I wish you a lifetime of happiness.
 Thank you.
 I wonder if we can come to understand  humans someday, just like he said.
 Licht seems to believe that, too.
 I guess it's possible... for elves  and humans to join hands someday.
 Father, where are you?
 ""Bind.""
 What is this?
 Good day, my prince.
 Minister?!
 No... The evil mana that's coming  from him doesn't belong to him.
 Who are you?!
 Who am I?
 Despair, hatred,
 disloyalty, or death...
 You may call me whatever you wish.
 A soul with evil mana...
 I've read about this being  from another world! A devil?
 Where are my father and the others?
 Who knows?
 Maybe they've gone to destroy the other race
 that's trying to harm the princess and,  indeed, the entire kingdom.
 I'm sure the elves will be quite surprised
 when the humans' violence and greed
 fall upon the wedding ceremony  that only you should know about.
 What?!
 Once I obtain my body and grimoire,  I'll come play with you again.
 Wait!
 Someone! Isn't there anyone here?
 Anyone!
 Prince!
 Secré!
 What's going on, Your Highness?
 There's a devil plotting something!
 So it wasn't you, was it, Your Highness?
 That magic item we made is gone!
 Secré! Break these restraints!
 Right!
 Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!
 Faster... I need to go faster!
 Tetia, Licht, everyone...
 Wh-What's going on?!
 The humans are attacking!
 This way! Hurry!
 I can't use any magic!
 Our magic has been sealed!
 Get down!
 This is light magic. That means...
 ...dare you...
 How dare you?!
 How dare you?! How dare you?!  How dare you?! How dare you?!
 How dare you?! How dare you?!
 I'll never...
 Lich...
 ...t...
 That's the magic item we made!
 Magic items that stored and distributed magic,
 and the elves' magic stones, which linked  to another world and amplified spells...
 A five-leaf grimoire...
 I knew it...
 Licht...
 I knew it wasn't you.
 I'm sorry I doubted you for even a second.
 Please forgive me.
 You are the future we believed in.
 You are hope.
 Licht...
 Right now, I am filled with  tremendous negative mana.
 I don't have full control anymore.
 At this rate, that devil will...
 Don't...
 To prevent my magic and body from falling  into the hands of something wicked...
 I've pulled even more negative  magic into myself.
 Don't... Don't do this, Licht!
 I'm sorry. This is my last selfish request.
 You're the only one who can grant it.
 Don't do this, Licht!
 Lumiere...
 Please kill me!
 The devil manipulated the prince and the elves
 so that he could throw the owner of  the four-leaf grimoire into deep despair.
 Because that is when a  five-leaf grimoire is born,
 and the devil is able  to appear in this world
 in his true form and  with his true powers.
 What in the world is that creature?!
 R-Run!
 Oh, God...
 It's the end of the world.
 I finally understand...
 why I was born with so much...
 magical power.
 I will not let you...
 become a murderer!
 That's...
 The prince!
 Prince Lumiere!
 They used a magic item that I created
 to steal the elves' magic...
 It was supposed to be used so  that we can all share magic.
 Prince... Lady Tetia... What should I...
 Is there still something I can do?
 My prince!
 Our magic item! The one we  made for equality and peace!
 I'll use the magic item we created...
 and absorb his magic!
 As I suspected... It's impossible  for it to absorb all of the magic!
 He stopped...
 The negative mana seems to be subsiding.
 Lumi...ere...
 Now's your chance.
 Hurry...
 Licht...
 I... will stop you!
 You stopped me from obtaining his body,
 but that was still quite  an entertaining show.
 I guess I'll just have to take  his grimoire for the time being.
 Stop!
 I won't let you have Licht's grimoire!
 The magic stones...
 You witnessed the end  of that elf, didn't you?
 If a human like yourself who isn't  loved by mana tried to use those,
 you wouldn't be able to keep
 your form even if you tried to  perform a puny little spell.
 Like I care. I'm going to use the  magic stones to increase my magic.
 Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!
 This is...
 Confinement magic, eh?
 Her seal is a bit vexing,
 but I can use reincarnation  with the magic stones.
 ""Come.""
 What?
 Even more despair and tragedy for  the soul who possesses the four-leaf.
 I guess I'll just have to  sow those seeds for him.
 Forbidden Magic: Noad Nepesh.
 I'll be sure to work slower and  much more carefully next time.
 In an era where you two don't exist.
 Secré!
 Are you all right?
 My prince!
 So you managed to seal the devil.
 But the seal that I put on  the devil will eventually...
 Prince!
 No...
 This is how it should be.
 I was able to keep my promise to Licht.
 So...
 My prince, I'm going to use  the magic stones to seal you.
 It probably won't be complete, but it  should be enough to keep you alive.
 If the devil's seal is broken,
 the peaceful future we sought  will be taken away from us.
 Secré, don't. If you use  any more forbidden magic,
 you'll lose your humanity.
 I cannot let you die here, Your Highness.
 As Licht said, you are  our hope for the future.
 It was several years later
 before I finally woke up.
 The prince began his long  slumber in the form of a statue,
 and for some reason, I turned into a bird.
 I've been spared? But in this form...
 I'll need the help of the future mages.
 But when I woke up, I definitely felt
 the existence of a hope that  could stand against that devil.
 Here we go again...
 There, there...
 Are they brothers... or perhaps twins?
 No, they're not.
 This one is rather calm, but this one...
 seems like he has a lot of spunk.
 First of all, they don't look a thing alike.
 Hm? ""Yuno""...
 Let's see. And the spunky one over here is—
 Hey! You're a bit too spunky...
 ""Asta,"" eh?
 Right! You two don't need to  worry about a thing anymore.
 Starting today, this is your new home...
 Asta, Yuno.
 Hope that can stand against that devil...
 I decided to wager  everything on this wish.
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 124:  ""Nero Reminisces... Part Two.""

 My prince, I will make  your wish come true.

124,"It appeared as though humanity  would be destroyed by the demon.
 But a single mage saved them all.
 His name was Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.
 He would eventually be called the first  Wizard King, and he became a legend.
 The devil we sealed away 500 years ago...
 The day his seal would be  broken was drawing near.
 Going against all reason in this world,
 I somehow assumed the form of a bird
 and continued to watch over Licht's grimoire.
 This place was now known as Hage Village,
 a place far, far away from the royal capital
 of the Clover Kingdom, out in the boonies.
 A small village in the Forsaken Realm.
 Asta, are you okay?
 I'm so sorry. It's all  my fault... I'm sorry...
 This is nothin'!
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King.
 I'm gonna become the Wizard King...  and protect you and everyone else.
 I'm gonna make everyone even happier!  So we can have even nicer things!
 And then, I'm gonna prove to everyone...
 Prove?
 That even if you're poor... or an orphan...
 you can still become the Wizard King.
 We can?
 Yeah.
 Can we really?
 Anyone can... if they work hard enough!
 Anyone?
 Me, or even you, Yuno!
 I'll... never cry again.
 Maybe I... no...
 Yuno?
 I will...
 I'll become the Wizard King, too!
 I'll get stronger, and protect  you and everyone else!
 I'm gonna make everyone happier!  So we can have nicer things!
 Nero Reminisces...  Part Two
 Where... am I?
 What in the world is going on?!
 Didn't I die?
 Huh?! Licht?
 What's going on?  I somehow look like Licht!
 Did my soul somehow end up in Licht?
 No... The feeling of this mana...
 This body... It's human!
 A human that looks like Licht?
 That's right... I'm sure that I died.
 The thing that Licht activated  when our magic was sealed...
 It must've been forbidden magic!
 Meaning... a reincarnation spell.
 This is...
 I can tell... I can feel them.
 Raia's soul...
 The souls of all the elves from the village!
 Licht must have activated a reincarnation  spell in those last moments!
 In order to save us elves!
 I have...
 been chosen.
 I will become Licht.
 No matter what I have to do...
 I will bring back all the elves.
 And this time...
 The humans betrayed someone precious  to me. They betrayed all of us!
 This time...
 This time, we'll destroy the humans!
 The only ones I can resurrect  right now are these three.
 For a complete rebirth... In order  to resurrect everyone else,
 I will require a phenomenal  amount of power and sacrifices.
 We'll gather the magic stones  that were once in our village,
 which have now been scattered.
 By using the humans, of course.
 Isn't that a wonderful idea?
 Yeah.
 Let's do this, Licht.
 We will get revenge against  those loathsome humans.
 I will give them endless despair!
 Humans, you shall serve as the foundation of the resurrection.
 Resurrecting the elves and getting  revenge on the humans....
 It was all due to a tragic misunderstanding.
 But they didn't know any better.
 Everything happened according  to how a devil had planned it.
 The royal capital... The Clover Kingdom  itself was about to be overrun by dark clouds.
 But at that time,
 I spotted hope.
 A gri... moire?
 My prince... Finally...
 The time has come.
 The three leaves of the clover  represent faith, hope, and love.
 Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.
 Within a fifth leaf...
 resides a devil.
 That devil happened
 to be different from the one who  had destroyed the elves' village.
 That devil would end up aiding  the boy with no magic, Asta.
 Eventually, Patry and his comrades would
 call themselves the Eye of the Midnight Sun
 and set out in search of the magic stones.
 By collecting all of the magic stones,
 they could resurrect the rest of the elves.
 This is your execution.
 They attacked a village in the boonies...
 Fuegoleon!
 ...attacked the royal capital,
 attacked the Underwater Temple,
 and finally,
 they collected all of the magic stones.
 M-Marie?
 Things keep happening one after  another. What's going on?
 What the...
 Too bad...
 What is?
 The era of the humans has come to an end.
 Yuno... Hamon... Klaus...
 Do not talk to us.
 You are not one of us.
 The resurrection of the  other elves was complete.
 Begone, humans!
 Now, the time for revenge has come!
 Those who guide the elves...  The Apostles of Sephira!
 The Apostles of Sephira
 By infusing Gravito Stones with magic,
 we will open the door to the underworld
 that was sealed under Clover Castle!
 The hell is that?
 What in the world is that?
 It's a magic space that acts as the  border between this world and the next.
 The elves of antiquity entrusted it  to the humans in an ancient pact.
 It's called the Shadow Palace.
 By setting the final magic  stone into the monument,
 the elves' resurrection would  become permanent,
 and the souls of their human  hosts would be destroyed.
 Asta and the others gathered at the  Shadow Palace for their final battle.
 But the thing that awaited them was...
 What is this cold, pitch-black magic?
 Don't tell me he's...
 A devil!
 What in the world is that creature?
 Thought it's still incomplete, I haven't  been in my own body in centuries.
 What a wonderful feeling.
 Elf that was chosen by a  four-leaf grimoire, I commend you.
 I praise you from the bottom of my heart
 for everything you've done up to this point,  as well as the results you have shown me.
 And now, I shall have you taste the  depths of despair, like he did back then.
 What... are you talking about?
 What's... going on?
 That day, the one who tricked the  humans into destroying the elves
 was me!
 And then you lot managed to let me fool  you in the most amusing way, too.
 The revenge went according to plan.
 All of you are fools!
 Five centuries ago, they got in my way,
 and though I was close, my incarnation failed.
 You were the next one I set my sights on.
 A new sacrifice that was loved by mana,  still young, and swayed oh so easily.
 Tragedy and a sense of mission...
 That was enough for you to  dabble in forbidden magic,
 which allowed the elves' souls to  be reincarnated in human bodies.
 What are you talking about?
 The one... The one who reincarnated us is Licht!
 Even if it meant dabbling in forbidden  magic, he gave us our last hope!
 Wrong.
 Because I was the one  who reincarnated you elves.
 Your leader doesn't want  the humans exterminated.
 Restoring the elves and that revenge  you longed for... All false goals.
 You merely walked down the  path I prepared for you,
 neatly leading the other fools after you.
 You truly did a splendid job.
 In the end, it led you to a  future that Licht didn't want,
 It's a lie... It's a lie... It's a lie...  It's a lie... It's a lie...
 and my incarnation, which finally  allowed my soul to return to my body.
 Indeed. You were chosen...
 as my brilliant, foolish pawn.
 Excellent work.
 This is just too amusing!
 Elves and humans... Your dreams and  ambitions make the best playthings!
 When the owner of a four-leaf grimoire  is engulfed in deep despair,
 a five-leaf grimoire is born.
 At last, I possess both my body  and my pitch-black grimoire.
 I can rule over the current world as  a devil with my true form and power!
 But we weren't about to let  that devil have his way.
 I spent all this time alone to  ensure that wouldn't happen.
 Now that your seal has been broken,  that means my seal will also...
 Nero?
 What a pathetic state you're in.  If only my spell was more complete...
 No, the only reason I was able  to return is because of you.
 Huh?
 Welcome back, my prince.
 I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
 The first Wizard King...
 The legendary statue had life within it.
 And you're—Huh?!
 N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Nero, is that you?!
 Today, we put an end to this long fight!
 Right now, it's not just us.
 We have friends that  feel the same way we do.
 Please...
 Win this, Asta!
 This light... I can feel my power welling forth.
 Is Asta at his limit?
 Asta, I'm gonna leave you  behind if you can't keep up!
 Where do you think you're going, Yuno?!
 That anti-magic brat  is merely letting himself
 be pulled along, following that  wind magic. He's hopeless.
 They're nothing to worry about... hmm?
 Where'd the anti-magic brat go?
 He hid in the shadows of the severed magic!
 He's in my blind spot, coming from  a different direction!
 They're pulling each other in and speeding up!
 ""Sto—""
 ""Stop.""
 ""Weaken!""
 ""Go back!""
 ""Hold back!""
 ""Stop!""
 I reached my... limit?
 Asta!
 Too bad!

 Hey there, chief.

 Who are you?
 Who...
 Like you need to know that.
 It doesn't matter how  strong or amazing you are.
 You've lost, and you're about to disappear.
 See ya, loser.
 We... won...
 Thank you.
 My prince...
 I guess it's time.
 I don't have the magic to keep  this body together anymore.
 My prince...
 Secré... Though I guess you might be Nero now.
 Will you watch their futures and  ideals play out for me, as well?
 Prince Lumiere! I've always...
 If you're going, I'll go with you!
 I gave everything I had 500 years ago,
 and my life was supposed  to end back then.
 But thanks to you, I was  able to protect the future.
 That's more than enough.
 I don't want you to close  off your own potential.
 I'm looking forward to futures beyond this one.
 Both of the Magic Knights, and the  Clover Kingdom you'll defend.
 I... The fact that I got to  serve you for all this time...
 made me very happy!
 And I was happy, too.
 Five hundred years...
 Thank you so much for waiting  for me for five hundred years,
 Secré.
 My prince...
 I'm sure there are many  more hardships ahead.
 But I'm sure we'll be okay.
 Because I'm not alone anymore.
 The Black Bulls return to where  their hideout once was.
 As they try to reconstruct their hideout,
 the Black Bulls become drained  and collapse, one by one.
 What could be happening to them?

125,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 After cleaning up the mess at  the royal capital for the time being,
 Asta and the other Black Bulls  returned to their hideout.
 We're almost home, you dumbasses!
 Yeah!
 After all that's happened, it feels  like we haven't been back in forever.
 Right?! Once we get back, I'm gonna  work out in peace, at least for today!
 In peace, eh?
 We're... almost... there.
 Return
 Heck yeah! We're here!
 Hey, Henry! Hurry up and turn  this thing back into our hideout!
 Hmm...
 Henry?
 What's the matter?
 Are you constipated?
 I... forgot... what... the...  hideout... looked... like.
 What?!
 Well, that's classic.
 What the hell, man?!
 You lived in the place the longest! How could you forget?!
 When you go in, there's the huge common room,
 and beyond that is...
 Tell him, Asta!
 Huh? W-Wait! I have no idea!
 It was my exhibit of Marie merchandise.
 It was a giant pantry filled with  ingredients from around the kingdom!
 Nah, it was a sauna.
 Did any of those actually exist?!
 Then again, I sorta think they did exist...
 Well...
 The rooms did keep moving around in  the hideout, so it's hard to remember.
 That's... because... you... guys...  kept... breaking... everything.
 Thanks for fixing the rooms, but don't  change the floor plan without telling us!
 How many times did I take the lost Yami  to the bathroom with my spatial magic?
 I-I wish you would've told us!
 I'm... sorry... about... that.
 I know!
 Why don't we tell Henry all of our requests
 and make the hideout even more  comfy than it was before?
 Great idea, Asta!
 Agreed!
 Making it even easier to enjoy  a drink than before is the best.
 We're making it comfier in general.
 This is my chance to get closer to everyone!
 Sure, knock yourselves out.
 All right!
 We're counting on you, Henry!
 Leave... it... to... me.
 Here and here.
 Just go ahead and jot down  your requests on those forms.
 Here. You guys get one, too, Nero and Zora.
 Jeez... You sure like meddling, you little shit.
 He seems to be having a hard time...
 Well, everyone basically  wrote whatever they wanted.
 My request is that we transfer the hideout  right next to the church where Marie is.
 Big Brother! Now we can  see each other every day!
 Marie! We'll be neighbors soon!
 I want to be in the same room as everyone  else for 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.
 I-I'm so embarrassed... I just want you to  make it so no one ever sees me again.
 I'd like a lot of curtains to shut so  I can make the place completely dark.
 I'm shooting for ten meals a day!
 You do that anyway.
 Make sure you tack on an  all-you-can-drink option, too!
 I'm surrounded by idiots.
 I wrote that I want the  room next to yours, Magna.
 Because I can tell what you're doing  behind those walls with my magic detection.
 I can mess with you all I want!
 I'm gonna kill you!
 Like you even could.
 The hell did you say?! Come back here, damn it!
 A-A room next door?!
 I guess if Nero ends up in a different room,  she can't wake me up anymore.
 I was just pecking at you because  your snoring was so loud.
 C-Come to think of it,
 Asta and Nero weren't even neighbors.  They were in the same room!
 B-But that was when Nero was a bird!
 She just perched on the windowsill!  Not that this has anything to do with me!
 Hmm...
 Looks like Henry's gonna take a while yet.
 O-Of course he is.
 Here, if you're bored.
 What's this for?
 Are we gonna kill some time looking for bugs?
 Did you dumbasses forget  about my adorable little pets
 that ran off when our hideout got destroyed?
 Go catch them before they  cause trouble anywhere.
 That's right!
 Oh, but that'll be a cinch. They got  used to me after I took care of them.
 Don't you underestimate those monsters.
 This forest is their backyard.
 After a couple of days,  they probably went feral again.
 You'll be dead an instant  if you let your guard down.
 Wait, wait, wait! If that's the case,  aren't you underestimating the situation,
 telling me to catch them with just thi—
 Shut your mouth and get going.
 Yes, sir!
 There are three magical beasts.
 If the rest of you are bored,  split up and go find them, too.
 Okay!
 You got it!
 Fighting magical beasts sounds like so much fun!
 I'll kill you if you lay so much as a  finger on any of my adorable pets.
 Hey, stop that! I'm busy talking  with Marie's picture here!
 Let's find them together, friends.
 I-It's a pleasure to work with you both.
 Listen to me, damn it!
 Noelle, Nero! Let's group up, since we're all newbies.
 I guess I don't have a choice.
 Hang on, where'd Zora go?
 What a pain. Like I have time for that.
 Now, then... I'll punish Masked Boy  With Droopy Eyebrows later for bailing.
 I've got a big job to take care of myself.
 I'm counting on you dumbasses.
 Hey, magical beasts!
 Get out here!
 Woof! Woof, woof, woof! Meow!
 Th-That's actually sort of cute.
 Meow?
 L-Like we'll ever find them that way!
 Besides, he said the magical  beasts went feral again,
 so they'll get us if we let our guard down.
 But I'm sure they'll remember me,  since I took care of them!
 They'll warm up to me!
 I mean, Nero, you were basically  like my pet when you were a bird,
 so you agree, right?
 Don't be rude.
 I was only watching over your grimoire.
 You were actually my pet.
 Ow, ow, ow!
 They say the more you bicker,  the better you get along...
 N-Not that I care about that at all!
 I only came with him because I had to!
 I sense ki!
 I-It's not like I was worried about you two—
 There you are!
 Anti-birds?!
 What are you guys doing here?!
 Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!
 You must've annoyed them by being so loud.
 Ow, ow, ow!
 I'll try looking for the  magical beasts from the sky.
 H-H-Hey, wait a sec!
 Maybe I was overthinking this.  I'm actually not sure they get along at all.
 Wait, we're alone together?!
 What a creepy-ass forest.
 You scared, Magna?
 Wh-What'd you say?! Shut yer trap  and hurry your ass over here!
 Hey, I told you to hurry—
 Knowing that dumbass,
 he probably hid somewhere just so he  could go ""Boo!"" and jump out at me.
 You're not gonna scare me!  And I'm gonna teach you a lesson!
 There you are! You think an ambush  like that would actually work?!
 Boo!
 My ""scare and shock"" plan  was a huge success!
 I'm gonna kill you!
 You think you actually can, Magna?
 Come at me with all you've got.
 No one's gonna stop us here,  so we can let loose all we want!
 You sure about that? I think we're  on pretty different levels now—
 I'll just have to show you.
 I became incredibly strong after  fighting you when you were an elf!
 Ooh, then me, too!
 The mana's calling me...
 It's been a while since we've faced each other.
 I might have so much fun that I go overboard!
 Bring it on!
 Wh-What in the world was that sound?!
 I think Magna and Luck are  revisiting their fiery friendship!
 Who the hell cares?!
 Hey! How long are you two  gonna hide behind me?!
 I-I'm so embarrassed! Please don't look at me!
 Then you should've stayed home!
 B-B-B-B-B-But I need a wall to hide behind!
 Who the hell are you calling a wall?!
 We don't know when the  magical beasts will attack,
 and this forest is really creepy and scary.
 Your face is scarier than  anything else here, Gordon!
 Huh?
 Also, it's really embarrassing,  so please don't look!
 There they are.
 I need to hurry up
 and catch them so I can get  back to Marie as soon as possible!
 Let's do this, you two!
 Whoa!
 Th-The hell are you two doing?!
 W-W-Well, they just appeared out of nowhere!
 Hey! You! Let go of me already!
 My fear's intensified even more!
 Hey! Hey, I said!
 M-My heart's not ready yet...
 I-I was a fool to count on either of you!
 Let go of me! How the hell  am I supposed to catch them?!
 So yummy, la!
 It's fate that makes me want to eat  buns while looking for magical beasts.
 And it's fate that I want to drink.
 Finral, go buy me another  one with your spatial magic.
 Um... We should probably get back  to looking for the magical beasts...
 Oh, quit being such a square and  drink with me, you goody-two-shoes.
 Have a bun. They're piping hot,  straight out of the oven, and nummy!
 Look, I'd honestly love to, but...
 If Yami found out, I'd be killed!
 But I'm sure the others  are already catching them.
 I guess we can relax for a  little bit longer—Huh?
 Hey, where'd Finral go?
 He must've gone to buy more booze.
 La!
 Hey, Charmy. Get me a snack—
 Did I drink too much?
 You got big all of a sudden, Charmy.
 And you're all hairy. And look at those nails.
 You need to take better care of them.
 The pretty boy from the Golden Dawn  won't give you the time of day at this rate.
 Wow, that was fun. You're not bad, Magna.
 Same to you.
 I guess I'll let you off the hook for today.
 Luck, you're not leaving me behind.
 If you get ten times stronger,  I'll get ten times stronger, too.
 So both of us can still get stronger.
 Don't you think so?
 My bad.
 I couldn't really hear you because  this magical beast caught me.
 Damn, you're hopeless.
 I'll save you in a sec...
 I don't have any stamina or mana left...
 I know, right?
 Hey, stop that! It's me!
 I was taking care of you guys before Asta!
 I don't even taste good!
 Man, I can't find them anywhere.
 A-And Nero hasn't come back, either.
 I feel all antsy when it's just the two of us.
 Those are Magna's...
 Don't tell me a magical beast got him...
 Magna! Luck!
 Wake up!
 This isn't good. The other Black Bulls  were also defeated by the magical beasts.
 What?!
 Asta... Forget about us...
 The captain's in... trouble...
 Occupied.
 Tch. I'm in here, damn it!
 Is that you, kid? Who said  you could come back already?
 You might be in a hurry,
 but I'm facing my final boss, and if I lose  focus, it's gonna go back into hiding!
 I said occupied, damn it!
 I guess you three aren't here  to take a piss together, huh?
 I'm sure Captain Yami will be fine, but...
 Magna and Luck were almost eaten,
 so if all three happened to attack  at once, it might be bad news!
 Captain Yami! Please be safe!
 Hey, come on. Stop licking me.
 Your drool reeks.
 Wait, Captain Yami! What the heck's going on?!
 I thought the magical beasts were after you!
 Yeah, I guess they sorta were.
 Looks... like... they...  wanted... some... attention.
 They wanted attention?
 Come to think of it,  when I first ran into these guys,
 they just wanted to be coddled, too.
 I can't remember exactly when,  but I was heading back to the hideout.
 I ran into them after their  parents were killed.
 Guess some nobles were having  some fun hunting magical beasts.
 Better give it up. Your folks aren't  ever going to wake up again.
 I got separated from my parents, too.  Chin up. We have to keep living.
 Hey, now. Don't get the wrong idea.
 I never said I was going to take care of—
 Guess you're not giving me much of a choice.
 That's such a touching story!  I'm so happy I heard it!
 The baby magical beasts are way too cute!
 Yeah...
 It didn't even take six months for  them to grow as big as their folks.
 Feeding them costs a fortune. I've tried  to abandon them so many times.
 I wish I hadn't heard that!
 Yeah...
 So I had you dumbasses catch them  before they attacked a nearby village,
 though if they wanted to go back into the wild,
 I was gonna let them loose in  some mountains somewhere.
 La!
 Are you all right, Mister Yami?!
 Magna!
 You're all safe!
 Yeah! Though we reek after those  magical beasts licked us all over.
 I thought we were gonna get eaten,  but they just wanted some attention.
 Apparently, everyone got exhausted  from that and collapsed.
 All of you sure are troublesome.
 I-If that's how they were with us,
 we were worried about how hard they were  going to beg Captain Yami for attention.
 But I guess that's Mister Yami for you!
 Well, he is their owner.  He's used to taking care of them.
 There, there, there, there...
 I need to make dolls of all of you, too.
 If you lick Marie, I'll kill you.
 They're cute, but their drool stinks.
 If you want any more attention,
 go take a bath and brush your teeth.
 I see... You guys must love  Captain Yami and the Black Bulls, too.
 There, there. You can ask me,  your caretaker, for attention, too.
 Guess they still think of you as food, kid.
 Wait, wait, wait! That can't be true!
 You must be hungry. Here you go!  I've got some food for you!
 Yeah, he's definitely food.
 That was a nice nap.
 Zora! Where the heck did you go?
 Don't worry about the details, you little shit.
 The hideout isn't done yet?
 The sun's going down.
 Don't... worry.
 I... just... put... everything... together.
 Recombination Magic: Black Bulls' Hideout  ~ Hard Rock Bison Style!
 Black Bulls' Hideout  Hard Rock Bison Style
 This... was... Magna's... request.
 How vulgar.
 The hell are you talking about?!  How could it get any cooler than that?!
 I can't wait to see the inside!
 Now this is what I'm talking about!
 I can drink all I want!
 I keep eating and eating, and food  still keeps coming around, la!
 Why the heck is there a hole here?
 I-I'm embarrassed, so I wanted a place to hide.
 I couldn't become neighbors  with Marie, but Angel Marie,
 tell Big Brother what the  weather will be like tomorrow!
 Tomorrow will be mostly sunny,  but partly cloudy.
 The high for tomorrow will be  24 degrees Celsius, with a low of 13 degrees.
 This talking Marie doll is the best!
 Good work!
 I guess a cutie-pie maid was too  much to ask for after all.
 I'll... clean... for... you.
 What?!
 Sorry... about... that.
 I-I appreciate the thought.
 So, Henry... How are  everyone's rooms split up?
 About... that...
 Here's... Gordon's... request.
 Let's all share a room as friends.
 What?!
 I'm not neighbors with Asta,  but in the same room as him!
 As friends? This is way beyond friendly!
 This can't be happening!
 This reminds me of when I used to sleep  with Yuno and Nash back at the church.
 Man, every night is gonna be so much fun!
 You can count me out.
 Same here.
 Y-Yeah. I'm royalty.
 I'm so embarrassed!
 Well, it pisses me off that  I'm in the same room as Luck,
 but it'll be cool talking with Mister Yami  into the wee hours of the morning.
 Yeah, that's not happening every night.
 What?!
 The... captain... gets... a... different... room.
 What?!
 The hell's this?!
 That... was... the...  magical... beasts'... request.
 All right, fine, then.
 Like hell, you asshole!
 Yeah, so...
 Our hideout isn't some fun little theme park.
 As before, this filthy mansion is our hideout.
 After all's said and done,  this is the most relaxing.
 I feel like we're finally home.
 I-I'm not disappointed in the least.
 When I first came here after  joining the Black Bulls...
 They all accepted me immediately,  even though I didn't have any magic.
 Ever since then, every day's been action-packed,
 and we had plenty of close calls,
 but I was able to get through  them thanks to everyone's help.
 I'm so happy that I got to join the  Black Bulls and get to know all of you!
 Wh-Where'd that come from?  You're making me blush.
 The same goes for us.
 It's because you never gave up,  Asta, that we were able to grow.
 You're always reckless, but I'll admit  that you're as stubborn as ever.
 We need to hurry up and prove Asta's innocence.
 Yeah.
 For now, we're gonna have to continue  our research on the devils.
 Right!
 We're back at our hideout,  so I'm gonna work even harder!
 Huh? Where are you going, Captain Yami?

 An elf stole my body...  and I couldn't protect all of you.
 I'm a failure as a captain.
 That's not true!
 It wasn't your fault, Sis!
 I was completely useless, too.
 The Black Bulls' captain... As much  as I hate to admit it, he saved us.
 Yami did?
 I see...
 Also, don't call me ""Sis."" Call me ""Captain.""
 Sure thing, Sis.
 More importantly, that guy...  I guess he's not so bad for a guy.
 For a guy, at least.
 I mean, he's still no match  for you, though, Sis.
 Don't tell me all that wasn't a dream...
 They're things that happened  when I was possessed?
 Well done, human.
 Y-Yami in my memories is so... close! And...
 But I had fun fighting  by your side, Yami Sukehiro.
 Well, look at you. Being all nice  and honest in the end, Charla.
 I'm pretty sure I'm not as awkward  as the owner of this body.
 I can't remember exactly, but I think  it was something like that.
 Wait... Does that mean Yami  knows how I feel about him?
 No, that can't be...
 Sis...
 Hey, Sis!
 What is it, Sol?
 Yo.
 The Captain of the Black Bulls is here.
 Yami?!
 Yami!
 Yami!
 Yami!
 Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you...
 What do you mean? I came  to see how you were doing.
 Here you go, Prickly Queen.
 I-I-I do not currently have the  mental or emotional capacity
 to be in the same room as Yami right now...
 Sol... Chase him away  like you usually do, Sol!
 Yeah... I mean, I guess he did save you,
 so it wouldn't hurt to let  him stay for a little while.
 Sol!
 You all better?
 Sis?
 It's not like I can stay in bed forever.
 Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What does my  face look like right now?!
 Calm down, Charlotte...  You can do this, Charlotte.
 Don't push yourself too hard.
 You've always been the  stubborn, awkward type.
 Awkward
 Awkward...
 You always cause so much trouble.
 Trouble
 Trouble...
 Trouble
 But I'm a bit relieved now.
 By the way, there's something  I wanted to ask you, Prickly Queen.
 S-Something he wants to ask me?!
 Wh-What... D-D-D-Don't tell me...
 You said something earlier, remember?
 You know...
 Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha...
 When you were under that spell...
 S-Spell?
 I want you to give me the details.  So that thing of yours...
 I'm pretty sure it was...
 A forbidden curse...
 The heck?
 Th-The Captain of the Blue Rose Knights?!
 Was he able to ask about the curse? About weg?
 Come on. Why so scared?
 Let's just go. It'll be fine.
 P-Please stop.
 Oh, come on. The country's a  mess right now, so we gotta—
 Not happening!
 Thank you very much!
 That was a close one!
 Thank you!
 Oh?
 Burglar!
 Thank you, miss—W-Wait!  There's a river over there!
 I was just hoping you could tell  me about the forbidden magic...
 Sis! Come back!
 Now I've done it.
 Why am I like this?
 I wasn't able to be honest  with Yami yet again.
 I'm sure he just thinks I'm a freak now...
 I became strong to persevere over  the House of Roselei's curse.
 Apparently, she raised her rank again.
 That newbie from the  Blue Rose Knights is so powerful!
 Not to mention beautiful!
 Lady Charlotte, please marry me.
 No, marry me!
 But I couldn't trust men, who were all talk.
 If you cannot defeat me,  you could never accept my curse.
 And then, my curse went out of control.
 The curse!
 The curse upon the House  of Roselei has activated!
 It's no use. We can't stop it! Ru—
 It won't... stop...
 At this rate, the town...
 Curses! How pathetic... I'm so pathetic!
 I'm so sorry... Mother and Father...
 What the hell's the big idea, you jerk?
 You flung the pasta soup  I was eating everywhere.
 Yami Sukehiro? To think I'd let him see  me in such a disgraceful situation!
 What a failure I am.
 On missions, you're as cool as a cucumber  and always raring to go. So what gives?
 I like tough girls.
 But it probably wouldn't hurt to ask someone for help once in a while.
 Our Magic Knights Squads are full  of strong people you can rely on.
 Yami saved me when all that was happening.
 But still, there was a part of me  that didn't want to admit that,
 and I continued fighting as the captain  of an all-women Magic Knights Squad.
 I...
 I'm...
 Blue Rose Knights' Headquarters
 What's up, Sis?
 Captain...
 What did you want to tell us?
 As all of you know,
 we, the Blue Rose Knights,  are female knights who pride ourselves
 in achieving acts of valor on  our own, without the help of men.
 Therefore...
 I'm prepared to resign as  your captain after I say this.
 I-I...
 I like Yami!
 No matter how hard I tried to  rid myself of these feelings...
 No matter how much I tried to  forget him, it was no use!
 I... I'm just...
 I'm just hopelessly in love with that man!
 Sis...
 As I figured...
 This is unforgivable.
 I'm... a failure as a captain.
 Oh my gosh!
 We'll support you, Captain!
 Huh?
 They're totally Beauty and the Beast!
 What a grand romance!
 You're both captains, so you're  perfect for each other!
 I actually have a boyfriend, too!  We've been secretly dating this whole time.
 What?!
 Me, too! It's been so hard to keep it secret.
 What?!
 Me, too!
 Actually, me, too!
 You should totally ask him out on a date!
 A d-date?!
 You've got this, Captain! I mean,  you could win any guy over!
 Wha—
 But before that, you have to  let him know you're interested!
 I-Interested?!
 You should tell him you love him!
 I know! There's a perfect restaurant!
 The night view there will  definitely set the mood!
 You'll be fine! No man could ever hate you.
 I'm sure he likes you, too!
 Captain, you have a cool complexion...  And you're a summer!
 So pink and pastel colors  would look best on you!
 Wow, your skin is so beautiful! Do you have a skin care routine? Oh, and...
 You've got great romance luck!
 I think a rose color would...
 Tell him how you feel!
 Tell him how I feel?!
 Tell him how you feel!
 H-Hey...
 Tell him how you feel! Tell him how you feel!
 Tell him how you feel!
 I'm... going to tell Yami... how I feel...
 Sis! W-Wait! Calm down!
 I don't know what's going on, but it  looks like you're having a blast.
 Sorry for butting in!
 Wow, so this is the  Blue Rose Knights' headquarters!
 It's really pretty!
 The hell are you doing?
 Of all the times for him to show up!
 Go on, Captain! This is  your big, big, big chance!
 Wh-What?
 Go ask him out on a date!
 What?!
 You can do it!
 H-Hey!
 Y-Yami... Um, uh... you see...
 Captain! I can't hear you at all!
 How cute are you?!
 Why'd you turn into a statue and  start muttering? Are you Gordon now?
 I know how you feel.
 Ba-dump!
 I've known all along.
 Ba-dump, ba-dump...
 Your ki is unique and indescribable...
 You...
 really don't like being around me, do you?
 Like, you can't stand me.
 Huh?
 But did you really have to scream your  lungs out and run away like that?
 You're going to scar my delicate little heart.
 We've known each other for years.
 It wouldn't hurt just to hear me out, would it?
 He's such an insanely oblivious, uncouth man!
 She's doomed.
 She won't even be able to  tell him how she feels!
 Th-That's not...
 I-I-I-It's no use! I can't get  the right words to come out!
 A-At this rate, he's going  to get the wrong idea...
 That's not true, Captain Yami!  I don't think she hates you.
 Ow!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Who the hell asked for your opinion,  Mr. Suspended Sentence?
 Th-The way the Blue Rose captain  is acting... it reminds me of Noelle.
 What?
 So she doesn't hate you.  She just really trusts you, I think.
 The more she trusts you, the harder  it is for her to tell you how she feels!
 I just recently realized this myself.
 So you just said yourself  that Noelle trusts you,
 and you're not embarrassed?
 Not one bit!
 We're comrades who've come through  so many life-or-death situations together!
 Seriously, Noelle just has a hard  time expressing how she really feels.
 So, Captain Blue Rose, if you have  a hard time saying something,
 just keep carrying on like you usually do!
 You're comrades who've been through  life-or-death situations, after all!
 Who the hell gave you permission to  touch Sis like that, you shrimp?!
 Looks like we've both been blessed  with wonderful Magic Knights.
 No, he's caused me  nothing but trouble, really.
 Asta, was it?
 I was informed of what happened.
 I'm sorry for all of the trouble  we caused while we were possessed.
 Nah, it wasn't your fault at all!
 Y-Yami... Um... You wanted to talk  to me about something, right?
 H-How about we have dinner?
 Sure.
 I have no idea what's going on, but finally...
 Sis... If she ends up with that guy,  what am I supposed to do?
 So... What did you want to talk about?
 Well, you see...
 Ba-dump, ba-dump...
 I wanted to know...
 Ba-dump, ba-dump...
 ...more about your rose curse.
 What's wrong?
 Thank goodness! Thank goodness  they didn't get together!
 But I also sorta feel bad for Sis,  since her feelings didn't get across to him.
 O-Oh... So that's what you wanted to talk about.
 Was there something else?
 Curse you for getting my hopes up!
 You know. The Black Bulls have to
 investigate the devils on  the Wizard King's orders.
 That psycho scales judge guy is  just itching to execute the kid.
 So I've gotta gather some clues,  being the kid's captain and all.
 It all began
 with a spell cast by a curse mage  who had a grudge against my family.
 But that spell was unlike any other in  this kingdom and impossible to break.
 Forbidden magic interferes with the  shape of your life and of the world.
 The curse that activated when I was eighteen
 changed the shape of my soul and  the quality of my magic itself.
 It is extremely likely that this was
 a forbidden curse that used  power from another world.
 I knew it.
 But I don't know much else about it.
 I see.
 I guess I wasn't much help.
 But if you need to know  about forbidden curses...
 There's someone in your own squad
 who has been affected far more than I have.
 In my squad?
 So many close friends... I'm so happy.
 So happy...
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Practice
 P-Practice?
 P-Practicing telling him how I feel about him?
 This is so embarrassing. But if it's  to help let him know how I feel...
 Ya...
 Yami...
 Your eyes are like jewels.
 They're so clear and pure...
 I love you!
 I love you too, Prickly Queen.
 I-Is that so? I see...
 Whatcha doin', Sis?
 S-Sis!
 Curse you, Yami. I was hoping  you'd at least take the hint...
 But I guess that's one of his charms.

 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently  aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 Clues
 Huh? My home?
 Jeez, you're scary.
 The Prickly Queen mentioned it,  but come to think of it,
 your family's famous for  curse magic, isn't it?
 Could you go ask them about forbidden magic?
 Forbidden magic?
 Yeah.
 Forbidden magic uses power
 from another world to meddle with the  ways of this world or people's lives.
 And that other world is where the devils live.
 I was hoping we'd be able  to get some information.
 If our investigation about the  devils doesn't get any further,
 my best friend Asta...
 I was going to try to go again,  even though I think I'll fail.
 For Asta's sake!
 A distinguished family of curse mages...
 Since cursing people was my family's trade,
 I never made any friends.
 On top of that, my family...
 Even when Asta's arms were cursed  by a member of the Third Eye...
 I asked them how we could  break the spell with a letter,
 but they wouldn't tell me.
 But things are different now.
 Today, I have my friends with me,  so I feel more confident.
 My arms are falling asleep!
 But I'm not done yet! My muscles are  screaming in joy, not in agony!
 Shut up! The only one who gets  to ride behind me is Marie!
 Just shut up and hang on!
 It's so embarrassing to meet  someone I don't know!
 My friends give me strength.
 Guys! Thanks for doing this for me!
 Tch. Why the hell do I have to do this?
 Looks like Noelle took off  to the royal capital,
 and since you all look so sleepy,  you guys can head out, too.
 You guys are pals, aren't ya?
 I'm definitely not going,  and I'll kill you if you refuse.
 Curse our captain for abusing his power.
 So I heard your family's, like,  really special somehow
 when it comes to curse mages, Gordon.
 What the heck are curse mages, anyway?
 They... are mages that made a trade out of
 cursing and bringing misfortune upon others.
 But I didn't want any part of that.
 I wanted to be friends with  people, not to curse them.
 That's why I pretty much ran away from home.
 I see.
 You ran away?
 Will you be able to get any  information from them, then?
 Also, they're not gonna curse us, are they?
 Being cursed by someone I  don't know is so embarrassing!
 The being cursed part doesn't bother you?!
 It'll be okay... I think.
 You think?
 I wanna go home...
 Let's go.
 This is basically a haunted house.
 It's so embarrassing to meet  a ghost I don't know!
 Get off of me! Damn it, Grey!
 I wonder what Gordon's family is like.
 It's me. I'm home.
 Welcome home, Gordon.
 Big Brother...
 So you decided to come home after all.
 They all have the same face!
 Let me introduce you.
 Father Nathan
 First, this is my dad, Nathan.
 Mother Jonna
 This is my mom, Jonna.
 Grandmother Nilenia
 My grandmother, Nilenia.
 Little Sister Roxanne
 My little sister, Roxanne.
 And...
 Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!
 This is our dog, Nunnally.
 Even their dog looks like them...
 What are you doing to our guest?!
 Nunnally, stop!
 Whoa! Don't all of you come over here at once!
 Are you all right, Asta?
 Yeah...
 Oh, sorry for the late introduction. I'm Asta.
 And this is Gauche and Grey.
 They're my friends from the Black Bulls  that I mentioned in my letter.
 I see. Well, now that you're all here...
 Why don't you join us for dinner?
 Weren't you two strangers  before you got married?
 Why do you look so much alike?!
 Gordon, you haven't had your  mother's cooking for a while.
 It must taste exquisite.
 The eyeballs of the creepy-crawly  snake are superb.
 I recommend the raw paralyzing frog, myself.
 Bread... Where's the bread?
 Grandma, it's in your hands.
 Oh, my. And it was on the  plate just a moment ago...
 Where did the bread go?
 It's in your mouth.
 Dad, I want to talk to you about something.
 I see. You must want seconds.
 No, Dad...
 Th-They're muttering over here  and muttering over there...
 I have no idea what any of them are saying.
 This is so awkward. What the hell is this?
 And it's not easy to make me feel awkward.
 Say something, damn it.
 Aren't we supposed to ask  about forbidden magic?
 I-I can't...
 Gordon, please stop shaking and ask!
 Hey, that's the grandma!
 Wow, this stuff looks really gross,  but it's super yummy!
 It's so good!
 Why the hell are you having  fun all by yourself?
 H-Huh?
 I think we can become the best of friends.
 Y-You want to give me something?
 What is this?!
 Is that you, Nathan? You've grown so big...
 You have to protect the House of Agrippa.
 Old lady, seriously...
 Oh, dear, Mother...  Perhaps it's time for your nap.
 I'm counting on Nathan.
 For the sake of our ancestor who made  the contract... the curse of Megicula...
 Yes, Mother.
 Megi...?
 Thank you for the meal.
 I-It suddenly got really quiet...
 All right!
 Gordon! It's the perfect opportunity to ask!
 Dad, I need to talk to you about something.
 I basically abandoned the family,  so I probably have no right to ask...
 But I have a friend that I want  to save, no matter what.
 So could you tell me about  forbidden magic curses and devils,
 for the sake of that friend?
 Sure.
 That was easy.
 I'll show you hex research  worthy of a family
 with centuries of expertise  as curse mages,
 as well as secret arts that deal  with poison, plague, and death.
 Are you ready?
 What the hell is this?
 Beautiful, isn't it?
 This is my curse research workshop.
 I'm researching every kind of pain there is.
 Dad... So you really were  researching such evil things.
 Gordon... I've been earnestly  waiting for your return.
 Your poison magic is a talent that makes you worthy of inheriting my research.
 I only came here to ask about  devil-related curses for Asta.
 I'm not coming home to stay!
 Oh, don't be like that.
 Death by curses, poisons, drugs...
 If you want to learn those secrets,  I'll teach you all of them.
 What do you think a person's life is?
 Humans die so quickly.
 That includes your friends.  Life is so fleeting.
 Black Oil Creation Magic:  Curse-Filled Nails.
 Guys!
 Asta!
 Wait, I'm fine?
 Hm... 36.5 degrees.
 Your temperature is normal.
 I don't see any physical abnormalities,
 though you really don't have magic.
 Dad, what are you...
 Well? I rechanneled what I know about  poisons that usually harm people,
 as well as our family's hereditary  expertise in curse killing,
 into health management and medical treatment.
 That being said, this endeavor  just started with my generation,
 so I'm only able to cure normal diseases.
 I wasn't able to help when  your arms were afflicted
 with an ancient curse, but...
 What's the matter?
 So, uh... You rechanneled your  knowledge about killing with curses
 toward health management  and medical treatment...
 So, wait, does that make you a recovery mage?
 Yes, starting with my generation, at least.
 I had no idea...
 I totally thought you were  cursing people to death.
 You people need to learn how to communicate!
 You're going to give people the  wrong idea with those things!
 You really can't judge a book by its cover!
 Dad, does that mean you're  going to help us out?
 But of course.
 What did you want to know about  devils and forbidden magic?
 Let's hear the details first.
 Yes, sir!
 Okay. Now I've sent most of the  large debris into my dreams.
 In mere moments!
 That's the Captain of the  Coral Peacocks for you!
 Thank you so much, Lady Dorothy.
 I'm glad you're still awake.
 Well, well...
 If it isn't the littlest sister  of the House of Silva.
 Did you need something?
 I want to know the truth  behind my mother's death.
 Did you hear something from Nozel?
 Yes. When we went to see  Solid and Nebra yesterday...
 Wh-What did you just say, Nozel?
 What do you mean, Mother didn't  die because she gave birth to me?
 When she was pregnant with you,
 Mother was already haunted by a  death that she could not escape.
 It was not an injury or an illness.
 It was a death that should  not happen in this world.
 A death that should not happen in this world?
 But that sounds like the work of  the devils we're currently investi—
 Say any more, and your life  will be in danger, too.
 If you still have the courage  to face the truth knowing that,
 then go speak with Captain Dorothy Unsworth  of the Coral Peacocks.
 Tell me. Why did my mother have to die?
 Sure thing! I could never  say no to a cute girl!
 She's so easy.
 Well, I'm leaving the rest to you guys, then.
 Yes, Captain Dorothy!
 Then again, it's not like  we have anything to do.
 Captain Dorothy's amazing  when she's actually awake!
 Um... Did my mother's death involve a devil?
 Shh...
 Didn't Nozel tell you?
 You shouldn't speak of that.
 You'll get cursed.
 At least, in this world.
 Huh?
 Where am I?
 Welcome!
 To Dream Magic: Glamour World!
 This is a world of dreams.
 A world separated from the outside world. Everything here is under my control.
 Here, have some tea.
 Usually, I trap bad people  in here and punish them,
 or I transport buildings or  injured people in here, like today.
 What in the world is this large-scale spell?
 So this is Glamour World?
 Everything's under her control?  But that's crazy.
 This tea is good.
 Noelle!
 Heya.
 Asta! What are you doing here?
 More importantly... Hup!
 You sure are cute today, Noelle.
 Wait, wha—
 I just want to keep staring  at how cute you are!
 W-Wait, no! Th-This isn't...
 That's the boy I created from your thoughts.
 Yup! You think about me all the time!
 What?! I absolutely do not!
 Oh, no!
 Oh, dearie me. You did also come  here for his sake, didn't you?
 Not at all! Not even a little!
 But just so you know, this is the perfect  place to have secret conversations.
 Secret? You mean...
 It's the perfect place to talk about Mother.
 Now it's Nozel?
 Though this is a Nozel that I thought up.
 You came to visit me after  talking to the real him, right?
 About the thing he hasn't  told any of his siblings.
 Your mother, Acier Silva, lost her  life due to a devil's curse.
 My mother... But why didn't Nozel tell anyone?
 Because those who speak of  it will share the same fate.
 That's the nature of the curse  that befell your mother.
 That's why he didn't tell  you or your siblings,
 and why I told him to come to me in  this world, because he can only talk
 about this curse in a world that's  separated from the outside world.
 I'm sorry it took me so long  to tell you this, Noelle.
 I didn't want to put you in danger.
 Ah, Noelle...
 Nozel?
 Ah, Noelle!
 Noelle!
 My precious little Noelle!
 I love you so, so much that I just  don't know what to do with myself!
 Noelle, Noelle, Noe—
 Nozel!
 Hey! Quit messing around with Nozel!
 Aw, but that's how Nozel always seems to me!
 What in the world was that chill just now?
 Well, now that Nozel's gone  flying away, let's get back on topic.
 The devils that live in the other world
 don't appear in our world unless  there's been some kind of anomaly.
 Mages can use forbidden magic,  contract them by paying a price
 of some sort, and use their power  in a limited way, but that's it.
 Or that was supposed to be the case,
 but now, their shadow is  wriggling around in our world.
 The devil's name is Megicula.
 Megicula... That's the  devil who killed my mother!
 And the key to saving Asta!
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 After hearing what you said yesterday,
 I looked into what our ancestors had to say about magic that collects curses.
 Investigating curses... Our magic  is basically made for that.
 Black Oil Creation Magic:  Curse Candle Ritual Disk.
 Is this...
 The Clover Kingdom?
 Holy crap!
 The flames are curses.
 Flame intensity shows depth and viciousness.
 This is a map of the sickness  eroding our kingdom.
 That flame is insanely fierce! Huh?
 That's our hideout!
 Wait... Then there's someone  in the Black Bulls who's cursed?
 The only one in our squad  who's not normal is...
 L-Let's see... All Luck ever  thinks about is fighting,
 Finral's always thinking about girls...
 And all Vanessa ever does is drink.
 Captain Yami always takes an extremely  long time in the bathroom.
 So basically...
 None of them are normal.
 Wait, wait, wait! What kind of curse  makes you stay in the bathroom forever?
 And if we're gonna get into it, everyone  here is pretty undoubtedly unique, too!
 What?
 B-Being called unique is too embarrassing!
 Huh? Bone!
 But I'm completely normal.
 At any rate,
 you're the last one I want to hear  that from, you zero-magic meathead!
 Oh, speaking of magic,
 maybe this is reacting to Henry.
 Oh, yeah. I guess his condition that  sucks away everyone else's mana
 could definitely be a curse.
 Yeah, he's cursed.
 Indeed, he is.
 There's a huge flame in  the royal capital, as well.
 I can't tell who exactly is cursed,
 but if you include the smaller  flames, that's quite a few.
 Can't we get a look at a bigger area?
 If we go too far out, the accuracy falls.
 That's...
 The Heart Kingdom...
 And there's a very big flame coming from there.
 Maybe there's a clue about the devil there!
 You're my dad, Nathan.
 We found some clues  on devils because of you.
 Thanks, Dad-Who's-Also-Nathan!
 My best friends are really happy, too!

 There's a stupidly huge  curse in the Heart Kingdom!
 Oh?
 I think we can find out something  about the devil's curse
 if we go to the Heart Kingdom!
 Where's Gordon? And what  does he think about this?
 He was gonna learn some curse magic,  so he decided to stay at home for a while.
 I see. Also, why did those two come back  looking like their minds are blown?
 Something about the food not  agreeing with them or something?
 I thought it was great!
 I think I got the gist of what's going on.
 Hup.
 Then do I get to go to the Heart Kingdom?
 Sure.
 I'll go make the arrangements,  so just sit tight.
 Not happening.
 Huh?
 There's no way into the Heart Kingdom.
 What?!
 What's that supposed to mean?!
 I was going to go to the Heart Kingdom, too,
 since the devil's curse is there!
 The Heart Kingdom has
 a bunch of its own unique trap  spells set up along its border.
 We set any of those off and  we're instant fugitives.
 Heart Kingdom
 Clover Kingdom
 Then it'd become an international incident.
 No way! Oh, but if we nullify the  trap spells with my anti-magic,
 we could probably get in!
 No, you fool. The moment we mess  with them, they'll find us out.
 Well, that's not good.
 Sounds like Rouge isn't going  to be able to help either, then.
 It'd be pretty much impossible  to get in without them knowing.
 Come to think of it, I think Mimosa mentioned  going to the Heart Kingdom before.
 Really?!
 Yes. She mentioned that
 there were some nobles going there  like they were exchange students.
 All right, Finral. Take these  jerks to the Golden Dawn.
 Sure!
 Huh? Finral, you usually complain  when you get used as an errand boy.
 Well, there's someone in the  Golden Dawn that I want to see.
 The Golden Dawn's Headquarters
 And that's when Finral did his best to stop you.
 Curse you, Brother.
 Langris! I heard you're awake! Thank goodness!
 Brother!
 Finral!
 I'm so glad you're all right, Miss Finnes.
 Must be satisfying.
 Huh?
 I tried to kill my own brother,  but was defeated.
 Then, when my parents tried  desperately to apologize for me,
 I tried to kill the king.
 I'm sure Father must be  quite disappointed in me.
 What are you talking about?!
 It all happened because you  were possessed by an elf!
 Don't worry! We can clear this up—
 On top of everything, I was saved by my brother, who I've mocked this whole time.
 I heard about the trial.
 You and that peasant are so insolent!
 You have no talent, yet you  take on so many burdens!
 This isn't over yet!
 Yeah, that's the spirit!
 You being like that makes  declaring war on you worth it.
 What?
 Starting now, I'm going to work hard  to make Father acknowledge me.
 I'll be a man worthy of being the  head of the House of Vaude!
 And...
 I'll be the one who makes Miss Finnes happy!
 I'm sorry to drag you into this, Miss Finnes.
 But...
 I'll become a man worthy of you,  and then I'll come for you.
 Please try not to take too long.
 Brother, a moment.
 Wait! Should you be moving, Langris?!
 Please wait here, Miss Finnes.
 Huh?
 Don't worry. I'm not going to try to gouge  a bunch of holes in my brother again.
 That's pretty scary, Langris.
 What's wrong, Langris?
 As you are now, you won't be  able to make Miss Finnes happy.
 Huh?
 Because...
 Vice Captain Langris...
 So you've awakened as well, Vice Captain.
 Yay! Look at you cuties!
 How about we grab some tea?
 See? I knew it.
 You're cursed!
 What?!
 You're a hopeless playboy who hits  on any woman in your path!
 Playboy
 P-Playboy?
 All that running away and trying
 to act cool made you a bigger  failure than you already were!
 Failure
 Failure?
 And once you pick up bad habits,  they won't be easy to break!
 Bad Habits
 How could someone like you with so  many faults make Miss Finnes happy?!
 Y-You're absolutely right.
 What in the world are these two doing?
 The vice captain has seemed like a   different person ever since he awakened.
 Make sure you work hard to  rid yourself of that curse.
 If you don't, I might just end  up marrying Miss Finnes first.
 So was breaking my curse a part  of this investigation, too?
 ""No.""
 Hmph. I won't let you be happy  that easily, Brother.
 I see... So that's why you've come to see me.
 Anything to help Asta.
 Yes, I've been to the Heart Kingdom.
 I went there on an exchange with  my brother when I was thirteen.
 Though I hated the fact  that it had to be with him.
 We were only allowed access to a limited area,
 but their magic techniques
 are different from the Clover  Kingdom's, so I learned a lot.
 It's a lovely kingdom with  abundant water and lush greenery,
 and its rich natural environment  generated so much mana.
 If what lies at its center  is indeed a devil or a curse,
 that's truly terrifying.
 Though it's hard to believe.
 A curse... That might be a clue about  the devil that Mother encountered.
 We weren't allowed to meet her, but the  queen who rules over the Heart Kingdom
 is apparently as powerful as  one of our Magic Knights Squads.
 She's known as the all-knowing mage who sees
 everything that happens in her kingdom.
 What?! That's awesome!
 A queen... Is she like the Witch Queen?  Then we might be in trouble.
 But I guess we're not going  over there to pick a fight.
 I'm not letting my guard down, though.
 I believe they're recruiting applicants  to go there right about now.
 I'll apply for permission  to enter their kingdom.
 Thanks, Mimosa!
 Holy crap! This is the first time  I've ever been on a ship this huge!
 My, what a cute little ship.
 You idiot. We're not going to play.
 I didn't know you had a boat, Yami.
 Why didn't you ever mention it before?
 Well, I went to go see the mushroom head  who works for Julius and threatened...
 er, discussed the matter with him,  and he was happy to lend it to us.
 Huh?
 You guys better not damage it.
 Right!
 Asta...
 Take care of Mimosa.
 You're overreacting, Klaus.
 We're not going over there to fight.
 But if something happens while  you're in a different kingdom,
 we won't be able to come to your aid.
 If only I could go with you...
 There's a limit of four...  So first, there's Asta.
 The royal lady from the Golden Dawn  who arranged all of this...
 And then Noelle, who doesn't seem like  she'll let go of her spot this time.
 And lastly, Finral.
 Oh, yeah. Why am I the fourth one?
 Having wheels with you comes in handy.
 Right?
 Yup, yup.
 Can't really argue with that.
 Definitely.
 He is rather convenient.
 Indeed. Spatial magic is convenient.
 I know that, but...
 No, really. You don't need to understand!
 Asta! Go kick some ass in the Heart Kingdom!
 What are you talking about?
 Right!
 Take care of things there and come home soon.
 I still have to fight you, Asta.
 Right!
 If you get homesick and have trouble  sleeping, just have a sip of this.
 Right!
 Wait, you can't.
 That should be enough to send them off.
 I hope you guys didn't forget that  you have a job to do yourselves.
 Of course we didn't forget, Mister Yami.
 Off we go!
 Yeah.
 All right. Make sure you all  stay on your toes out there.
 Yes, sir!
 Two thousand and thirty-one... Two thousand and thirty-two...
 Two thousand and thirty-three...  Two thousand and thirty-four...
 Two thousand and thirty-five...  Two thousand and thirty-six...
 Keep it steady...
 Keep it steady...
 Two thousand and thirty-seven... Two thousand and thirty-eight...
 Keep it steady...
 Out of all the possibilities,  why did I have to be stuck on a boat
 with two super-adorable royal cuties  and a cool beauty who turns into a bird?!
 I don't think I'm gonna be  able to sleep at night!
 Tough it out... Tough it out, Finral!
 Miss Finnes is the only one for me!
 Um...
 Why don't we have some lunch?
 Thanks, Mimosa!
 I hope you like them, Asta.
 So you made these, Mimosa?  I'm digging right in!
 It's so good!
 This one's good, too!
 Thank you very much.
 Asta... Don't eat all of it, okay?
 This frustrates me for some reason.
 I-I need water!
 Here's some water.
 That's too much!
 I hope you're grateful.
 For what?!
 I almost fell into the ocean just now, y'know!
 I'm not sure why, but this frustrates me.
 Didn't I tell you that I can't swim?!
 I don't recall.
 What?!
 What in the world am I being  forced to watch right now?
 How was I supposed to know? I'm royalty.
 What?! That doesn't even make sense!
 We're finally here!
 We're actually entering  the Heart Kingdom legally!
 We're not coming here to play, you know.
 I'm sorry I was only able to  gain entry for the four of us.
 What are you talking about, Mimosa?  I have nothing but thanks for you!
 If all else fails, we could  use Finral's spatial magic—
 That would be unlawful entry.
 It got foggy all of a sudden.
 The only ones who are  allowed through this fog
 are those permitted by the  Queen of the Heart Kingdom.
 I couldn't sleep one bit knowing two  beautiful girls were sleeping near me.
 More importantly, what does the Queen  of the Heart Kingdom look like?!
 Damn it! Is she hot, too?!
 The Heart Kingdom... I wonder what it's like.
 Heart Kingdom
 That's the Heart Kingdom?
 Their water sources, the city, and the  forest are all mixed together?
 That's awesome!
 It looks like they have arrived as planned.
 The devil power from the Clover Kingdom...
 We must get our hands on it.
 Hmph. I guess this place is sort of pretty.
 I wonder where we should tie the boat up.
 Please continue sailing forward.
 You're...
 Welcome to the Heart Kingdom.
 Spirit Guardian Gaja
 I am the Spirit Guardian Gaja,  and I will act as your guide.
 Is he someone important?
 Seems to be.
 It's been quite some time, Lady Mimosa.  We met on your previous visit.
 Good day to you, Gaja.
 I'm honored that you remember me.
 You were quite popular with those who  had made your acquaintance, Lady Mimosa.
 This is Asta, Noelle, and Finral.
 It's a pleasure to meet you.
 Here is some crimson orange  juice that tastes even sweeter
 after some magic is run through it.
 Please enjoy.
 Thank you very much.
 What in the world is this? It's delicious.
 Mine's not sweet at all! Run some  magic through mine, too!
 O-Oh, fine...
 You said to keep sailing, but it  looks like a dead end up ahead.
 Fear not.
 The queen will transport us.
 The queen? So this is just one mage's magic?!
 The mist barrier and the water stairs
 are a product of the queen's Mana Zone,  which covers the whole kingdom.
 That's awesome! And so is this juice!
 He can't be serious. It covers the  whole kingdom? Is that even possible?
 Look! Pretty butterflies!
 It truly is a lovely kingdom.
 It's hard to believe there's a devil here.
 It's been 1,200 years since  our kingdom was founded.
 In every generation,  the queen has made a pact
 with the Water Spirit as a priestess,
 and has used its magic to protect the kingdom.
 Using the power of the water and trees,
 this has encouraged the development  of a magic civilization with deep mana
 that does not allow unwanted guests to enter.
 That's amazing... A single queen manages  to keep peace in a kingdom this big?
 Yes. That has been the case up until now.
 Though we do not know what the future holds.
 Asta!
 What are you... What is the  meaning of this, Gaja?!
 There's something we need  to maintain this peace.
 First, we need to go after Asta!
 Leave that to me!
 Let's go, Mimosa!
 Believe in our transporter!
 Of course!
 Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!
 Ah... That's only third stage or so.
 Your magic is rather intriguing.
 Finral!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
 Huh?
 He's floating without using any magic?
 I don't know what you're trying to do here...
 But do you really think you'll  get away with harming a friend
 of royalty from the Clover Kingdom?
 That's our Noelle!  She's super cool, pretty, and cute!
 No, wait! Miss Finnes is the only one for me!
 Rare and powerful magic...
 Definitely first stage.
 That's rather impressive water magic.
 I will not hold back either, then.
 What is that?
 I'm sorry for inviting you  here in such a rough manner.
 Huh?
 We were waiting for your devil,  for the sake of our kingdom.
 I just got blown away to some weird place!
 This is the Heart Kingdom's queen?
 Then that's...
 Damn it!
 His attribute is lightning?
 Then what were those rune things?
 Is that a unique Heart Kingdom  magic technique?
 Lightning Magic: Tenjiolia.
 It's fast...
 But I can evade it with my Valkyrie Armor!
 As expected from a first stage. But...
 I told my spell to pursue  you until it strikes you.
 Gaja, please return Asta to us.
 Otherwise, we'll be forced to fight with you.
 An attack spell...
 It appears Lady Mimosa  has also grown to third stage.
 And it looks like that spatial mage
 is able to create a path wherever he can see.
 Let me give you a glimpse of the  difference between our levels.
 He cast his technique into the sky?
 This magic is...
 Humans are no match for  the vast mana of nature!
 I'm somehow getting by for now,  but I don't know how much mana they have!
 Damn it! Why the heck am I even fighting, anyway?!
 So you negate magic...  That is your devil's power.
 What the...
 It's quite abominable, but it  also seems rather useful.
 It's a pleasure to meet you,  devil-possessed boy from the Clover Kingdom.
 Water Spirit Undine
 I'm Undine. I'm one of the four  Great Spirits, and I'm contracted
 to the Queen of the Heart Kingdom.
 You're quite amazing,
 but you're no match for me.
 Not to mention, you don't have  a lick of magic yourself.
 Without any magic, you're less than ninth stage.
 Ninth stage?! What's that?!
 Oh, right. You don't use magic  stages in your kingdom, do you?
 The lowest is the ninth stage, and then  you have the eighth, the seventh...
 That's how we measure and rank  both magical talent and skill.
 I can't move... or breathe!
 And the highest...
 is stage zero.
 True Lighting Magic: Irial Astrauza!
 I can't sense their mana  anywhere that I can see.
 They must've fled using spatial magic.
 A wise choice.
 But no matter where they go...
 He accurately manipulated space  in a place he couldn't see?
 Plant Creation Magic: Magic Flower Guidepost!
 Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!
 Sorry, but we can't just back down  after you did all that showing off!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Sorry, but you can't measure our  true powers by talent alone.
 Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!
 This magic...
 I'll keep my anti-magic in reserve  so she can't pull me in!
 Judging from the ki,  there's definitely a person over there!
 That means there must be air there, too!
 Pardon me! I'm coming in!
 Asta and the others are attacked  as they arrive at the Heart Kingdom.
 Could it be that the Heart Kingdom  has been taken over by a devil?
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 129: ""The Devil Megicula.""
 Page 129   The Devil Megicula
 And the queen, Loropechika, appears.

129,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently  aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 Asta and the others arrived
 in the Heart Kingdom to learn  more about the devil's curse,
 but Asta was taken away, and Noelle, Mimosa,
 and Finral were forced to fight  the Spirit Guardian Gaja.
 Meanwhile, Asta, after being taken away,
 was forced into a fight with  the Water Spirit, Undine.
 I'm Undine. I'm one of the four  Great Spirits, and I'm contracted
 to the Queen of the Heart Kingdom.
 Undine and Gaja...
 Asta and the others were  forced to face one of
 the four Great Spirits as well  as a Spirit Guardian, but...
 Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!
 Sorry, but we can't just back down  after you did all that showing off!
 Pardon me! I'm coming in!
 The Devil Megicula
 A doll?
 But I could've sworn I felt  a person's ki in here.
 Uh...
 Hey.
 I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
 This thick-pelted beaver just  felt so good on my skin!
 What the heck was that fo—
 Glasses... My glasses....
 Goodness... What are you doing, Loropechika?
 I told you to hurry up and  change out of your pajamas.
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
 Loropechika
 So she's the queen of the Heart Kingdom?!
 I might've been in trouble if  my technique hadn't defended me.
 It appears that she was holding back.  What a magnificent talent.
 Now, as for them...
 He's way too fast!
 I do apologize.
 I forced you into a fight in order  to assess your magic stages.
 Huh?
 Magic stages?
 The stage nine, eight, seven thing,
 where the smaller the number is, the stronger you are?
 Yes. Mages fight not with force of numbers,  but with how powerful their magic is.
 There are cases where dozens may attack,
 and they would be no match for a single mage.
 That's why, in wars between magical nations,  power is measured by magic stages.
 In other words, a kingdom's power  is determined by how many mages
 Stage Zero Stage One Stage Two Stage Three Stage Four Stage Five Stage Six Stage Seven Stage Eight Stage Nine
 it has that are near stage zero.
 And if you're dealing with a devil,
 no one lower than stage one will  be able to keep up with it.
 A devil... That's right!
 We came here because we detected  a huge curse signal here that may be
 the work of a devil!
 Why do they know something that  only a Spirit Guardian should know?
 Do you know anything about devil curses?
 You don't hold back, do you?
 It's too bad for you, but no one's  going to talk about them.
 Oh, that's me... I got cursed by a devil.
 If nothing is done, I'll die in about a year.
 Huh?
 Huh?!
 Huh?!
 Huh? Why did you tell them?! What?
 Huh?
 Huh?
 Huh?
 Honestly... What am I going to do with you?
 That side of you is adorable, too.
 That's right. The reason we brought  you here and measured your magic stages
 was so that we can defeat Megicula,
 the devil that cursed Loropechika.
 I'm sure this interests you, too.
 Citizens of the Clover Kingdom,  please join us in—
 What's wrong?!
 I forgot to water the poplatatta trees!
 D'oh!
 I'm pretty sure we were in the  middle of talking about something
 really important just now!
 Is it okay for the queen of  a kingdom to act like that?
 Holy crap!
 There you go. Have some water.
 I see the zozo squirrels  are as lively as ever today.
 Hey now, Michely. Don't run too fast.
 Old man Kakalasa's cough seems  to be better. That's great.
 Oh, the totohl fruits grew so splendidly!
 She's watering whole forests at once!
 She obtained information from all  around the kingdom in an instant.
 And she's controlling the water everywhere.
 An all-encompassing benevolence
 combined with delicacy that  doesn't miss a single thing...
 So this is the magic of  the Heart Kingdom's queen.
 Now, now, Loropechika...
 Go and get changed into  some proper clothes already.
 The current queen has inherited the  power of most of the previous queens.
 The guardian deity of the beautiful  and peaceful Heart Kingdom...
 The all-knowing priestess...
 Someone who cannot be lost to a devil's curse.
 There is no one else like her!
 See? You're beautiful when you  actually clean yourself up.
 But it's so hard to move in this...
 Why, though?!
 For crying out loud, Loropechika...
 I get it! Her insane klutziness must  be due to the devil's curse, too!
 Oh, no. That's just me.
 What?!
 Curse... The loathsome devil that  cursed my beloved Loropechika...
 Megicula is in that kingdom.
 Diamond Kingdom
 We came to scout the Diamond  Kingdom just in case, but...
 This is...
 He managed to defeat all those  Diamond soldiers on his own...
 Some of them were as strong as our captains,
 yet he defeated them so easily.
 Don't you dare get any stupid ideas, Luck!
 I hate to admit it, but I've  never felt like this before.
 I actually...
 don't want to fight him.
 Heart Kingdom   Royal Palace
 The Queen's Chamber
 Hey, guys!
 Asta!
 Hey!
 Thank goodness you're okay.
 You get kidnapped way too often.
 Give it a rest already.
 The queen has arrived.
 She's so majestic and beautiful.
 And she possesses vast, immeasurable magic!
 So this is the queen of the Heart Kingdom?
 She's so beautiful!
 You are truly a goddess who  has descended upon this land!
 Damn it! You know better than that, Finral!
 You! Are! Going! To! Change!
 What the heck's going on with Finral?
 Who knows?
 Citizens of the Clover Kingdom,
 please lend us your strength.
 Wait, why?!
 Come on, Loropechika!  You need to act like a queen!
 Ow...
 Oh, your nose is bleeding... But you're so cute!
 Wh-What was that?
 I got some blood on my dress.
 Okay, okay, just a second...
 This is why I said she shouldn't  meet them in person.
 Why do you need our help?
 Doesn't the Heart Kingdom have many  mages who are stage one or higher,
 including the Spirit Guardians?
 I mentioned earlier that everyone  needs to be stage one or higher
 to keep up in a fight with devils,
 but even if one was stage zero,
 they would not be able to finish off a devil.
 The Spirit Guardians borrow some power  from natural mana to use powerful magic,
 but they still cannot defeat devils.
 Unlike us, the Clover Kingdom has  created types of magic that are not natural,
 such as chain, steel,  and the eccentric spatial magic,
 in exchange for giving up the  divine protection of natural mana.
 Some of the irregulars who were born
 in that environment have the  power to defeat a devil.
 For example, the Wizard King who  uses time magic, Julius Novachrono,
 or the Captain of the Black Bulls,  Yami Sukehiro, who uses dark magic.
 Though it appears that Julius  has lost most of his power...
 She even knows about that?
 Just how much does she know?
 And...
 Asta and Nero.
 In terms of combat magic alone,  Nero is about a stage six,
 but she has ancient sealing magic  and has used forbidden magic.
 And Asta doesn't have any magic,
 but he was able to obtain  anti-magic because of that.
 People with inexplicable powers such  as yours are known as arcane stages.
 Stage Zero
 Arcane Stage
 Arcane stage...
 I'd like you to lend us your arcane  powers to help defeat that devil.
 In exchange, I'll offer you any  information that is available to me.
 We can't make decisions like that.
 I'll use a transmission magic item  to ask Captain Yami!
 I'm taking a dump right now!
 What? You've got something  really important to tell me?
 Well, what I'm doing right  now is really important, too.
 This might be the biggest dump in history.
 Call back later!
 What?!
 Pooping is indeed very important.
 She agreed with him?!
 You mustn't use such vulgar words, Loropechika!
 Um... I figured something  like this may happen,
 so I borrowed a magic item that lets us  connect with Marx's transmission magic.
 Good job, Mimosa!
 Way to go, Mimosa!
 All right, I'll go ahead and connect.
 Mimosa? Did something happen?
 Wait, is that...
 You must be the queen of the Heart Kingdom!  What kind of magic do you use?!
 Please don't just pop up  like that, Master Julius!
 You're small right now, remember?
 People will find out.
 Well, yeah, you did just  call me ""Master Julius.""
 Don't worry. The queen already knew.
 Huh?!
 And so, in order to defeat  devils, we need to be...
 at the arcane stage, or something.
 Of course, that's fine.
 You all might get something  amazing out of this, too.
 To tell you the truth,  I'd prefer to be over there myself.
 You absolutely may not!
 It's settled, then. Thank goodness.
 But in your present states,  all of you will be killed so easily.
 Wow, she's honest!
 So the Spade devil is that strong?
 Yes. Stronger than the devil  you fought, I believe.
 Stronger than that guy?!
 During that fight,
 we only managed to win because we had help
 from incredible people like the first  Wizard King and the leader of the elves.
 The scar Gaja has is the  work of that devil, too.
 Him? The guy we barely  stood a chance against?
 That Spirit Guardian fellow fought  me in the past. He's quite skilled.
 He fought you?!
 A devil that can't be beaten by  someone the Wizard King praises...
 We don't stand a chance right now...
 We have to get stronger.
 The devil Megicula is  haunting the Spade Kingdom,
 using its citizens to amass power...
 in order to invade and  conquer the Clover Kingdom,
 the Heart Kingdom, and the Diamond Kingdom.
 As things stand, I will  also die from this curse.
 I'd like to invade the Spade Kingdom  before my power weakens.
 We have half a year.
 We'll need all the combat  power we can get.
 Please gather those who stand  a chance in a fight with a devil.
 I'd like you to get stronger and  fight alongside us in six months.
 Right! We'd also appreciate...
 ...your help!
 Master Julius, are you sure  you're all right with this?
 The Magic Knights are still exhausted  from the battle against the elves.
 Though we have half a year,
 if we fight alongside the Heart  Kingdom to defeat a devil,
 we may face even greater casualties.
 I'm sure you heard what our scouts said.
 With the Diamond Kingdom in its current state,
 our only hope is to have the  Magic Knights get stronger.
 I'm sure the Queen of the Heart  Kingdom understands that, too.
 Master Julius...
 Marx, gather all of the  Magic Knights Squad Captains.
 Yes, sir.
 Munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy, munchy...
 When's the captain gonna show up?
 We have a super important announcement!
 Shut up, you stupid shrimp.
 If you don't quit yappin', the captain  won't be able to finish his business.
 He's taking a dump again?!
 I won.
 Wait, have you been in there ever since then?!
 This isn't the end.
 As much as I want to celebrate my victory,
 the next battle is just around the corner.
 That's seriously enough about that.
 Right. Let's hear what the group that  went to the Heart Kingdom has to say.
 Oh, right.
 Actually, I'm not sure where to begin.
 Me, me!
 The one cursed by a devil there  is the Heart Kingdom's queen!
 And because of that curse, the queen  only has about a year to live.
 The queen is the most powerful in the kingdom,
 and a mage chosen by one  of the Four Great Spirits.
 If they lose someone like that,  the Heart Kingdom will...
 This goes without saying, but keep this on the down-low.
 So, did you find anything out about this devil?
 The devil's name is Megicula.
 And they're in the Spade Kingdom right now!
 Spade?
 Then maybe that explains what we saw.
 Huh? What are you talking about?
 Apparently, they saw a Spade mage near  the border of the Diamond Kingdom.
 A Spade?!
 He was no ordinary mage.
 He managed to
 single-handedly finish off hundreds  of Diamond soldiers in an instant.
 And that cold, dark magic...
 Everything would make sense  if he's possessed by a devil.
 It's very possible that the guy  we saw was Megicula himself.
 Th-Then the Diamond Kingdom...
 They're pretty much done for.  All because of that one guy.
 Mars...
 It was clear just from being near him  for a little while... We stood no chance.
 Even if we had acted, we would've faced  the same fate as the Diamond soldiers.
 Yeah, as you guys are right now.
 If we can't defeat that devil,
 both the Heart Kingdom and the  Clover Kingdom are gonna be finished.
 In order to stop that...
 We're gonna have to get stronger.
 The queen gave us six months.
 In six months, the Heart Kingdom  will attack the Spade Kingdom.
 We Magic Knights of the Clover Kingdom
 need to train as hard as we can for  six months, get super strong,
 and defeat Megicula along  with the Heart Kingdom!
 Question.
 Sure thing, Zora!
 So this devil's actually  beatable if all we do is train?
 We won't be able to keep up in a fight
 against a devil unless we're  all stage one or higher.
 For perspective, that would  mean we'd all have to be
 as strong as 1st Class Senior Magic Knights...
 no, we need to be above that,  or we don't stand a chance.
 So you're telling us to get to a  vice captain's level in six months?!
 You sure make it sound easy.
 And currently, the only ones who  stand a chance against the devil
 are the Wizard King, Yami, Asta, and Nero,
 who all belong to a group  called the arcane stage.
 Though I don't plan on giving up even  if I'm told I don't stand a chance.
 Because Megicula is the  one who killed my mother.
 Come on! Pull yourself together, Luck!
 Lady Noe just said she wasn't gonna give up!
 We're her seniors! We can't chicken out!
 I wasn't being myself.
 I don't have time to be scared  when our friend's life is at stake.
 Friend's life?
 Of course, I'll do everything  I can to become a stage one.
 In order to protect my bestest friend, Asta!
 That's right! I need to do  something about Megicula,
 or I'm gonna be sentenced to death!
 How could you forget that?
 Guess we don't have a choice, then.
 True Magic Knights can't just  let devils do whatever they want.
 I-I have no idea what I can do...
 But I'll do my best!
 I'm gonna use these six months  to become even stronger
 and defeat this loathsome curse!
 So that I can become a man  worthy of Miss Finnes, as well.
 After we defeat Megicula  and our curse is broken,
 I want to talk to Nozel again...
 about Mother.
 Anyway, we just need to kick Megicula's ass!
 Then I might be able to find  out more about my devil, too!
 For the sake of their futures and this world...
 I can't let another devil  have its way any longer.
 So that means for the next six months,
 the Black Bulls are free  to do whatever they want.
 You can go wherever you want.  You can team up with whoever you want.
 You have one mission: to become stronger.
 We're dealing with a devil  and the Spade Kingdom.
 You need to train like your life depends on it.
 If you don't, I'll kill you.
 I always tell you to do this in the moment,
 so if you have six months,  that should be plenty of time.
 Surpass your limits!
 Right!
 It's not just the Clover Kingdom.
 This is a life-or-death situation  for the Heart Kingdom
 and Diamond Kingdom, too.

130,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently  aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 The New Magic Knight Squad Captains' Meeting
 The Clover Kingdom.
 Much of the royal capital  was destroyed in an attack
 by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 but the repairs are going smoothly.
 The citizens have gathered  in the square to prove
 that the threat of the Eye of  the Midnight Sun has passed,
 and that the kingdom is doing
 everything it can to restore peace  and get life back to normal.
 It's Lord Vangeance!
 He's wonderful!
 Captain of the Golden Dawn William Vangeance
 He's the hero who saved the kingdom!
 They're the pride of the Magic Knights!
 Lord Fuegoleon!
 Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings Fuegoleon Vermillion
 Not only has he returned as captain,  he now controls Salamander!
 Captain of the Silver Eagles Nozel Silva
 Lord Nozel's bangs are as charming as ever.
 I heard that he was on the  front line of this battle!
 Lady Charlotte!
 Captain of the Blue Rose Knights Charlotte Roselei
 Every rose has its thorns... But I wouldn't  mind getting pricked by Lady Charlotte.
 What in the world are Yami and the  Captain of the Praying Mantises doing?
 I can't believe they're late on an  important day like this. Unbelievable.
 Rill!
 Captain of the Aqua Deer Rill Boismortier
 I wonder if something's wrong.  He looks like he's spaced out.
 Yeah... He's definitely in love. I can tell.
 Where did that lovely lady go?
 The young master's first love...
 The Butler of the Boismortier Household Walter
 Ah, Madam... The young master  is slowly becoming an adult.
 I'm sure you'll have a lovely  grandchild any day now.
 Look! It's Lady Dorothy!
 Captain of the Coral Peacocks Dorothy Unsworth
 And she's awake?!
 I never knew she had such beautiful eyes.
 Heya! How's everyone doing?
 Lord Kaiser looks so dapper for his age!
 Captain of the Purple Orcas Kaiser Granvorka
 But he seems a bit down.
 Look! It's Lord Julius!
 The Wizard King!
 Lord Julius!
 Wizard King's Advisor Marx Francois
 Did he get injured?
 I heard it was actually Lord Julius
 who saved all of us from that attack  by the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 He must have endured an intense  battle to protect us all.
 That must be how he got hurt.
 He's forever our hero...
 The Wizard King!
 What? You want me to be the Wizard King?
 He couldn't possibly—
 Well, I mean, I can't go strolling  out there looking like a kid.
 And we can't have the king finding out, either.
 But it'd also be strange if  I didn't appear on that stage.
 But it'd be obvious that it was me up there.
 Oh, don't worry.
 You just have to stand up there.
 Here. Conceal your face with this.
 What?
 You obviously look different now,  but I see you haven't changed at all.
 Please don't let them notice...  Please don't let them notice...
 Ahem...
 The Wizard King has a sore throat,  so he cannot speak to all of you today.
 Please forgive him.
 I wanted to hear the Wizard King speak...
 He can't help it.
 Yeah...
 Now, I'd like you all to  give a big round of applause
 to the valiant hero who  bravely faced our enemies.
 Our great king,
 King of the Clover Kingdom Augustus Kira Clover XIII
 Augustus Kira Clover XIII!
 Wow. It's the king.
 He's so cool.
 I love you, Your Majesty.
 Why are you dawdling?! Pick up the pace!
 This is my time to shine!
 Bah-yes!
 Wh-Why? I know I just went with the flow,
 but how did I get stuck as the king's attendant?
 Don't you dare stand next to me!
 Yes, sir!
 That goes for you, too!
 Curse you, Julius.
 How dare you make me give  a speech to the people
 just because a cold made you lose your voice?
 But this is the perfect chance
 to show the people my dignity and benevolence.
 You're a fool if you think your  popularity will last forever, Julius.
 Good day, my fine citizens!
 I am your king, Augustus Kira Clover XIII!
 My majestic presence has  left them at a loss for words.
 When will this be over?
 Shh!
 Your Majesty, the public awaits your wisdom.
 Please do not make them wait too  long and keep it brief, if possible.
 Oh, of course.
 Tch! Curse you, Vangeance.  How dare you order me around?
 Thanks to my valiant deeds and  some help from the Magic Knights,
 the threat known as the Eye  of the Midnight Sun has fled.
 The Clover Kingdom is safe,  and peace has been restored.
 This must be a result of my daily good deeds!
 But I'm sure that some of you remain wary.
 What will happen to your everyday lives?
 What if other enemies attack?
 There is nothing to fear!
 Behold! My majestic light magic!
 How brilliant! How valiant!
 Light Magic: Absolute Monarch  of Divine Brilliance!
 Perfection.
 I give you my word, my adoring public!  The Clover Kingdom is in safe hands!
 Leave everything to me!
 Tch! You damn beanpole!  Let's settle things once and for all!
 You damn foreigner! Let's see who's stronger!
 The hell do you want?!
 What're you guys doing?
 Yami, Jack...
 I'm certain I told you that today was
 an important day when we  were going to tell the people
 that we'd taken care of the Eye of  the Midnight Sun and restored peace.
 Was that today?
 I totally forgot.
 Not only were you late, but you're  fighting over something ridiculous.
 Well, he started it.
 What? You're the asshole who started it!
 That's enough, you two.
 Remember where you are.
 Tch...
 The Black Bulls and Praying  Mantises are so violent.
 I saw in the paper that one of the  Black Bulls is possessed by a devil.
 I knew there was no way
 they should've placed second in  stars at the last Star Festival.
 Yeah. They're the worst  possible squad, after all.
 H-H-How dare you?!
 That was my absolutely invincible light magic!
 Huh?
 What're you talkin' about?
 You know what I'm talking about!
 How dare you interfere with my spotlight?!
 Your Majesty. Please show  the people your leniency.
 I believe it best to show  them how merciful you are.
 I-Is that so?
 Tch. Who cares what you think?!
 Just because people praised you as  a hero! Get off your high horse!
 Indeed. I-It's wonderful  to see how lively you are.
 Continue with your ways.
 Do everything you can for the Clover Kingdom.
 Sure.
 The king is now taking his leave.
 I ask that you send him off  with a round of applause.
 C-Captain Jack...
 Um, could you call me back to the  Praying Mantises sometime soon?
 Huh? Who the hell are you?
 Bah-ha?!
 What are you doing?! Come here at once!
 B-Bah-yes!
 He's one of yours, isn't he?
 Like I'd ever choose a guy like that.
 Let us take our leave, as well.
 Right...
 Okay!
 Lord Vangeance!
 Good grief. It's finally over.
 So... why're you dressed  like that, Old Man Owen?
 What?!
 A-All of the Magic Knights  Squad captains are here?
 I feel immense pressure...
 Wh-Why were we called to a Magic Knights  Squad captains' meeting, anyway?
 My apologies, Yami.
 It should be your squad receiving  praise from the public, not me.
 Well, we're used to getting booed.
 I apologize.
 It's no big. Don't worry about it.
 Calm down. Don't let your  heart go aflutter, Charlotte.
 Stay calm... perfectly calm...
 What's wrong, Prickly Queen?  Your face is red. You okay?
 I-I'm perfectly fine!
 You know...
 If you need to take a dump,  go now! Don't hold it in!
 Of course that's not it!  How are you so devoid of tact?!
 I was wrong?!
 Of course you're wrong!
 You just don't get it, Yami.
 This is why people say you're  so oblivious. Am I right?
 You have to take a piss, right?
 No!
 The captains...
 Are they always like this?
 This is a rare sight to see, in its own way.
 Damn that Julius. He's the one who  called us all here, and he's late again.
 He didn't forget he called us all here and  then just wander off somewhere, did he?
 Damn that old man... I mean, old brat.
 You know... that might actually  be possible this time.
 Yeah! Like, totally!
 Yeah...
 So what the hell's wrong with him?
 No idea. He's apparently been like  this ever since the spell broke.
 Sorry to keep you waiting, everyone.
 Hey, I see you're all here.
 Damnatio Kira
 He's...
 It's Damnatio.
 He was called here, too?
 Pardon me.
 You jackass...
 If you have a problem with  one of my squad members again,
 I'll gladly take you o—
 Yami.
 I'm the one who called Damnatio here.
 You did?
 It appears that what you'll be  discussing today concerns me, as well.
 Therefore, I was told that I was obligated to be here.
 Today, we'll be talking about the devil  that resides in the Spade Kingdom.
 The other day, a few of our fellow  citizens went to the Heart Kingdom
 to find out more about the devils.
 I believe that you have all seen the reports,
 but I would like to hear from the  ones who were actually there.
 If you would.
 Right!
 All right.
 In the Heart Kingdom,  they measure a mage's strength with
 a system called magic stages.
 The stages go up in order from nine. The smaller the number, the stronger the mage.
 Stage Zero Stage One Stage Two Stage Three Stage Four Stage Five Stage Six Stage Seven Stage Eight Stage Nine
 According to Queen Loropechika,  it's not the total number of mages,
 but the number of mages near  stage zero that will determine
 who is more powerful in a battle among mages.
 And this part's really important...
 If we're up against a devil,
 apparently we won't stand a chance unless  everyone fighting is stage one or stronger.
 Stage one, eh?
 The powerful curse in the Heart Kingdom that
 Asta and the others went to investigate
 was the one cast upon Queen Loropechika.
 It seems the queen only has about  another year to live due to the curse.
 And the one who put that curse on her...
 ...is the devil Megicula.
 And from a separate report from  another group of Black Bulls,
 the Diamond Kingdom is currently  under attack by the Spade Kingdom.
 In the past few years, the Spade Kingdom  has become more and more powerful.
 It's very likely...
 ...that specific devil is helping them out.
 What we'll be discussing at this meeting  is what we should do to go up against
 the Spade Kingdom and this devil.
 Queen Loropechika plans to attack
 the Spade Kingdom in six months,  before she becomes weaker.
 We are thinking of assisting the  Heart Kingdom and fighting alongside them.
 I would like all of you to train your  squad members as much as you can.
 We only have six months,
 but do everything you can to  raise everyone's magic stages
 so that we can face the Spade Kingdom  and protect this kingdom.
 I've heard from Queen Loropechika  that the Spirit Guardians
 will also help us out.
 Can I count on all of you?
 Of course.
 Yes.
 Like you need to even ask us.
 We've already started.
 The Black Bulls will be doing as  we please for the next six months.
 William?
 I will participate in the fight...
 But after everything I've done,
 I cannot face my squad as the Captain  of the Golden Dawn any longer.
 I ask that you relieve me  of my duties as captain.
 Huh?
 Hey!
 Also, I'd like you to assign me a new mission.
 I'd like to put my life on  the line to defeat the devil.
 C-Captain...
 In that case, I am also guilty.
 Though my body was taken over by an elf,
 the crimes I have committed against the  Clover Kingdom are punishable by death.
 I agree. I am not worthy of being a captain.
 It's honestly not bugging me much.
 Be a little bit bugged, at least.
 Now, now, just wait a moment.
 I understand why you feel guilty,
 but I cannot relieve you  of your duties as captains.
 Besides, what you said  just now would end up
 involving all the other Magic Knights  who were possessed by elves, too.
 And then who would be  left to protect this kingdom?
 If you want to atone for what you did,
 you have no other option but  to forget your positions
 and do all you can to  protect this kingdom.
 I trust in all of you.
 Yes, sir.
 Very well.
 Roger!
 As you wish.
 So, Damnatio, does that work for you?
 Whatever do you mean?
 In order to defeat the devil, the Magic Knights
 will have to get stronger  in the next six months.
 I'd like you to think about  what to do with Asta
 after we've taken care of this matter  with the Spade Kingdom, if you would.
 I have no objections.
 But do not get the wrong idea.
 I'm only agreeing to this because
 doing otherwise at the moment  would not benefit the Clover Kingdom.
 Now, if you'll excuse me.
 That heartless scales bastard.
 So, uh, I... Thank you!
 No need to thank me.
 Right! Thank you very much!
 Again, I'm counting on all of you.
 Leave it to me!
 I wonder how I should sever  my squad members...
 I'm getting excited just thinking about it!
 Yeah, maybe don't.
 I can't wait!
 I should go lay out plans  for training immediately.
 Why don't all the squads do this together?
 That is definitely an option.  Having mock battles would also help.
 I ain't gonna hold back!
 That's my line, asshole.
 Sounds like we'll need to round  up some healing mages, too.
 Don't get too carried away, okay?
 Oh, right. Marx, you can have him come in.
 As you wish.
 Oho?
 Hey, it's Hard Ham.
 Former Captain of the Purple Orcas Gueldre Poizot
 I'm sure you're all very familiar with  the former Captain of the Purple Orcas,
 Gueldre Poizot.
 The other day, while Gueldre  was at the Shadow Palace...
 He managed to carry away a load of  ancient magic items and jewels
 with his former senior  and Magic Knight, Revchi.
 Oh?
 You heathen. You never learn.
 I was planning to keep him whole,  but I can't wait any longer!
 I'm gonna turn him into sliced ham right now!
 No, wait.
 I'm thinking about pardoning Gueldre.
 Pardoning him?
 Huh?
 Gueldre has a knack for business.
 I'm sure he'll be able to  turn an even bigger profit
 from the treasures he tried to get away with.
 And I'd like him to use that money  to help support the kingdom.
 You know, since repairs cost quite a bit.
 It's not like the kingdom has endless riches.
 You'll help us out, right?
 U-Um...
 Suddenly this all depends  on me turning a profit!
 Right?
 O-Of course! I will do everything  that I possibly can!
 That'll help us out quite a bit. Thank you.
 Y-Yes, sir!
 There was no way he could decline!
 That was a different kind  of pressure than Yami uses.
 Tch! Make sure you pull your own  weight around here, Hard Ham.
 Mess this up and I'm gonna  sell you as sliced ham.
 One last thing.
 Like I said, the kingdom  doesn't have endless riches.
 So to help out with that,  I'd like to make your salary as
 Magic Knight Squad Captains  half of what it usually is.
 What?!
 Seems like a logical solution.
 I have no objections.
 Of course, I agree.
 Sure...
 Okay!
 I'm fine with that.
 It's the least I can do.
 Well, I guess that's that.
 Now, hang on a second!
 You can't be serious!
 What's the matter?
 Half?! Come on, man! I'm in debt!
 You want us to go broke?!
 Well, you know, you need to set  an example for your subordinates.
 I absolutely decline!
 Well, majority rules, so...
 There you have it.
 We now conclude the Magic Knights  Squad captains' meeting.
 This is bullshit!
 Closed for a Private Event
 How long are you going to carry  on with your drunken rambling?
 I won't put up with this any longer.
 Yeah, go home, you square!
 Must be nice...
 You assholes always had money.
 I'm sure getting your salary  cut in half doesn't even sting.
 Damn it!
 This is nonsense.
 It's always best to drink in moderation.
 Ciao! See you later.
 Come on, you can hang out a little longer.
 Yeah, you have time.
 Come on, brave hero who saved  the kingdom. Let's play a little game.
 Game?
 We'll get back the salary we  lost by taking it from you!
 Very well.
 We'll take everything you've got!
 Good grief...
 I win...
 Now I've got three times my salary...
 I'm very grateful to both of you.
 Despite everything that happened,  you continue to treat me the same.
 I promise you that I will do everything  in my power to defeat this devil.
 Goodnight.
 Sorry to cause such a fuss, sir.
 Thank you very much.
 The Magic Knight Squads make  their move to go up against
 the Spade Kingdom and the devil.
 In the meantime, Asta and Yuno  head back to Hage Village.

 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 A New Resolve
 Noelle, control your broom!
 I am!
 We're gonna fall!
 What are you grabbing, Stupidsta?!
 I'm royalty!
 In front of you! Look in front of you!
 In front?
 Dang it, stop shaking my broom!  I can't regain control.
 You never had control to begin with!
 That's why I said I'd run! And yet...
 ""You're going back to Hage Village?  F-Fine, I guess I can take you!
 I've got complete control  of my broom now!""
 My ass!
 There's no way you could  run all the way there!
 How many days would that take?!
 Also, quit complaining when I'm  kind enough to give you a ride.
 You consider this giving me a ride?!
 I'm going on ahead.
 Hey! No fair, Nero! Take me with you!
 Nope.
 Nero!
 S-See? I told you that I was  able to control my magic now.
 This is n-no biggie at all.
 I knew I should've had Finral take me.
 Hey, look, Asta! Over there!
 I see the demon head.
 Y-Yeah...
 You'd better be grateful! I'm royalty!
 Whoa!
 Yuno!
 Hey!
 Hngh!
 Yuno!
 Hey, it's Meathead.
 Yeah, the biggest meathead I know.
 Yuno! Are you going home to the village, too?!
 Yeah. Captain Vangeance gave me permission.
 I'm in the same boat!  All right, it's competition time!
 What competition?
 To see who can get to the church first, duh!
 Of course, it's going to be me!
 Seriously, a race?  You're not children. What an idiot.
 Right, Yuno?
 You can't be serious.
 Nom.
 Thank goodness the damage  was minimal over here.
 It's a blessing in disguise, I'd say.
 What's that?
 That's...
 All right! I win!
 Took you long enough.
 Looks like I win, Asta.
 You just got here, too, dang it!
 I win.
 Jeez, even Yuno's acting like a kid.
 But...
 That's what's so cute about you. Poke!
 Look at you, being all bashful!  That just makes you even cuter!
 Asta?! Yuno?!
 Hey, Father.
 I'm home.
 Asta! Yuno! You've gotten so big!
 Look at the two of you!
 You just saw us recently.
 Oh, right. I just couldn't help myself.
 Are you okay now, Father?
 Orsi Orfai
 Yup! I'm all better!
 More importantly, Asta...
 I saw you in the paper.
 Right. About that...
 That article is mistaken.
 Yuno...
 Asta isn't a devil's servant.  He's actually trying to defeat them.
 Please believe that.
 Of course I do.
 No one in Hage Village believes that article.
 Asta, Yuno...
 You two saved this village.
 We're all proud of you.
 I see. Thank goodness.
 By the way, about that newspaper article...
 I made sure to get it framed!
 Please don't!
 Could you sign it later?
 No!
 Where's everyone else?
 They...
 Did something happen?
 Father!
 They've... They've all left!
 They've all left!
 A school?
 Yes. The magic school that everyone  in Hage Village always wanted.
 We were finally able to build  a school in this village.
 Thinking back... on everything  Hage Village has been through...
 since we were basically abandoned  by the royal capital...
 After you two joined the Magic Knights,  everyone felt more motivated,
 and we were finally able to make it a reality.
 Sister Lily is teaching the  children as an instructor.
 Way to go, Sister!
 I teach some lessons now and then, too.
 Hey, welcome back!
 Asta! Yuno! Thanks for saving the village!
 Sure!
 And that's the magic school.
 The whole village got together and remodeled  the tato storage we weren't using anymore.
 Remember when we'd play hide-and-seek  in there all the time, Yuno?
 Did we?
 Sure we did! You hid in there until it got dark,
 then you started crying because you  got scared when I couldn't find you.
 You can't be serious.
 I'm totally serious!
 Now you're ignoring me?!
 My prince...
 197... 198... 199...
 200... 201... 202...
 Asta! Yuno!
 Welcome home!
 Home!
 Hey! It's good to be back!
 It's really them?
 Asta! Yuno!
 Whoa...
 Yay! It's really them!
 Wow!
 Asta, I think maybe you grew a bit... or not.
 Hey!
 And Yuno is as cool as ever.
 He's not just cool. He can be cute, too.
 The dolly talked!
 She's the Wind Spirit!
 Spiwit!
 I'm Bell.
 I'd prefer it if you didn't  treat me like a dol—
 I'm gonna play with the spirit dolly.
 Me, too! Me, too!
 Spirit dolly!
 Uh, hello?! Hey, Yuno! Save me! Yuno!
 Asta... Yuno...
 Lily Aquaria
 I'm so glad you're both safe.
 Sister...
 Please marry me!
 Please marry me!
 Wow, that takes me back.
 We used to hear that every day  when Asta still lived here.
 I think I finally got the hang of it.
 Please marry me!
 M-Marry?!
 Wait, you can't just propose  to me out of nowhe—
 I missed this feeling.
 Sorry, it was a reflex.
 Don't come charging at me like that, Stupidsta!
 Uh, okay...
 N-Not to mention, m-m-m-m-marriage?
 That's so sudden...
 You must be a fellow Magic Knight  from the Black Bulls, young lady.
 Yes.
 Thank you for always taking care  of Asta. You must be Noelle.
 Asta always mentions you in his letters.
 Huh? Letters?
 J-Jeez... What could you possibly  be saying about me in those letters?
 Could it be...
 My heart is set on someone.
 Yes... Noelle.
 How dare you?!
 Wait, why?!
 What in the world are they doing?
 Oh? Are you also a member  of the Black Bulls, miss?
 That's Nero!
 She's our new squad member!
 My, my...
 Please continue to look after Asta.
 Likewise.
 I know! Asta, Yuno...
 I know you just got here, but I have  a favor to ask you. Is that all right?
 Yes.
 I'll do anything for you, Sister!
 So you see...
 I'd like you two to act as  teachers for the little ones.
 Us?
 Teachers?
 Yes. Everyone in this kingdom  looks up to the Magic Knights,
 so I think being instructed by some  Magic Knights would be a nice memory.
 They've truly grown up so much.
 Instructor Asta!
 Instructor Yuno!
 Structor!
 Instructor...
 All right, leave it to me! I'll teach  you all the important things!
 Listen up! Magic equals muscles!
 What are you even talking about?
 You guys haven't got much mana yet!  So how are you gonna make up for it?
 That's right! With muscles!
 That's why you all need to train!
 All right, let's do this! Go run!
 What in the world are they doing?
 Instructor Yuno!
 Will you be the girls' instructor, then, Yuno?
 Instructor...
 You don't need to think too  hard about the ""instructor"" part.
 Just playing with them is fine.
 Playing with them?
 I'm sure the little ones will learn  something just by observing you.
 I see.
 Instructor Yuno, let's play house!
 Play... house?
 Why do I have to be the baby?
 I'm royalty...
 You're so cute, Noelle!
 R-Really?
 If I'm doing this,  then I need to give it my all.
 I'm a baby...
 I'll do it!
 Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah!
 You're so good!
 Mommy, please calm your baby.
 O-Okay...
 Th-There, there...
 That's not right, Yuno! You need to be nicer!
 Nicer?
 Sister!
 You need to take this seriously.
 The little ones will definitely  learn something by watching you.
 All right.
 Come here, little one. There, there.
 There's no need to cry.
 Oh, you must be hungry.
 Here, have some milk.
 Suckle, suckle, suckle...
 Is that good? Excellent. Now, now...
 Parum, you've got ketchup on your cheek.
 Whatever am I going to do with you? You're such a little troublemaker.
 Yuno...
 I wonder who you took after.
 It must be your father.
 Well done, Yuno.
 But what are the children  supposed to learn from this?
 This is the ""new leaves"" class.
 They're all working hard for the  day they get their grimoire.
 The grimoire awarding ceremony...
 It hasn't even been that long since  we had ours, but it feels so long ago.
 Yeah...
 All right, that's it.
 They're...
 Yeah.
 And stop.
 Wonderful! You're doing wonderfully!
 Your magic is improving so  much through your studies.
 Keep it up.
 Yay!
 It's Asta and Yuno!
 It's been so long!  I'm honored to see you again!
 Asta!
 Yuno!
 We feel really bad for what we did back then.
 We decided to turn over a new leaf  after we saw how amazing you two were,
 and became assistant instructors here.
 They actually became good guys!
 Did you hit your heads?
 Oh, Headmaster.
 Headmaster?
 Oh! It's the old guy who gave us our  grimoires at the grimoire tower!
 Asta, Yuno, welcome back.
 I heard of all the wonderful  things you've been doing.
 I'm very proud of you.
 Because of your feats, the children have more  motivation when it comes to learning magic.
 That's why we built this school.
 It's thanks to us?
 Now, then...
 The Grimoire Tower is home to many  a grimoire, each waiting for its master.
 They are all unique.
 That includes size and thickness.
 But the ones who will increase the number
 and the power of the spells  within them are you children.
 With a little bit of hard work,  you can become whatever you'd like.
 Yes, just like Yuno and Asta here.
 Aw, shucks.
 I have a dream.
 I dream that some of you children will  someday become like Yuno and Asta.
 No, seriously!
 Okay!
 I see.
 So you'll be going back in the morning.
 All right, then. We're going to throw  the biggest tato party tonight!
 Look forward to it, Asta and Yuno.
 Yeah!
 Miss Noelle, Miss Nero,  I hope you'll both join us.
 Thank you...
 I'm pretty sure it's going to  make my mouth a desert again.
 Hey, is that Nash?
 Hey, Nash!
 Oh, it's just you, Asta.
 Don't give me that.
 By the way, why weren't you at school?
 Playing hooky?
 I had something I needed to do.
 Like what?
 That's none of your business.
 Hey, wait a second!
 Nash! You shouldn't be playing hooky!
 You know, Nash isn't actually skipping school.
 Yes. We're all trying to  act like we don't know...
 But you know how much he  looks up to Asta, right?
 So he said he wanted to be like Asta  and join the Magic Knights someday.
 I see.
 298... 299... 300!
 And now for this moguro leaf juice, which is supposed to be
 good for increasing magical powers!
 So gross...
 One more drink!
 All right! I can feel my mana overflowing!
 That even if you're poor... or an orphan...
 I'll prove that you can become more  amazing than anyone else in this world!
 Just like Asta!
 My prince, please continue  to watch over them.
 I'm sure this kingdom's future... will be bright.
 Here, give this to Asta and Yuno to eat.
 I brought so many tatoes!
 Yes, yes...
 Do you need any help?
 Leave peeling that tato to me!
 Thanks.
 Honestly...
 Where could Asta have gone?
 But really... What did he write about  me in the letters he sent here?
 You crying?
 Of course I'm not!
 I'm just really happy.
 Not only was I an orphan,  but unlike you, I had no magic.
 I was always made fun of when we lived here.
 But...
 Asta, Yuno, welcome back.
 ""I heard of all the wonderful  things you've been doing.
 I'm very proud of you.""
 So, yeah...
 Of course.
 Because we've accomplished that much.
 We've proven that you can  become whatever you want
 through hard work with our actions.
 But it's not over yet.
 We've only just begun.
 Yeah. In order to face the  threat of the Spade Kingdom...
 And the devils...
 We have to become even stronger.
 In order to protect everyone...
 ...let's continue moving forward.
 Let's get stronger, Yuno.
 Of course, I'm going to become  far stronger than you.
 Guess we're about even for now.
 You can't be serious.
 I'm going to become the Wizard King.
 No matter what hardships await us,  I will overcome them.
 I will become stronger.
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 132: ""The Lion Awakens.""
 Page 132  The Lion Awakens
 There are others trying to  become stronger, too.

132,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently  aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 After receiving some time off from Yami,
 Asta headed back to his home village of Hage.
 On the way, he unexpectedly reunited  with Yuno, who was also heading home.
 Once they reached Hage,
 they learned that the village  already knew that Asta
 was suspected of being a devil's servant.
 I saw you in the paper.
 Right. About that...
 That article is mistaken.
 Asta isn't a devil's servant.  He's actually trying to defeat them.
 Please believe that.
 But no one in Hage Village had  doubted Asta, not even for a second.
 On the contrary, they were very proud of him
 and Yuno for becoming Magic Knights  and saving the village.
 Asta and Yuno got to enjoy  a brief visit back home.
 But it's not over yet.
 We've only just begun.
 In order to protect everyone...
 ...let's continue moving forward.
 The Lion Awakens
 Just you watch, Yuno!
 I'm gonna get even stronger!
 Well, aren't you all riled up  first thing in the morning, Asta!
 There are other things to  think about, aren't there?
 Try some. You need your nutrients.
 Thanks!
 It's so good! I can feel the  energy flowing through me!
 We need to get even stronger
 so we can go up against the  devil with everything we've got!
 In that case, here. All of you have  some so you can work even harder.
 Thanks, Charmy.
 Magna's covered in cake!
 You bastard! I have no idea who  the hell you are, but keep it down!
 Don't you know this is the hideout  of the Magic Knights Squad
 led by Mister Yami, the Black Bu—
 I'm pretty sure this has happened before...
 I-I knew it! You're...
 Captain Mereoleona?!
 Mereoleona Vermillion
 I see your door is as weak as ever.
 So... what brings you here today?
 I don't see Yami, but whatever.
 All of you who are here  right now, come with me.
 No! I have nothing but  bad feelings about this!
 But we haven't finished eating our cakes, la!
 This seems fun!
 I seriously have no idea  what's going on right now!
 Where are we supposed to go?
 Shut up. You'll see when we get there.
 Strong Magic Region
 Yultim Volcano Trail
 We see it, all right...
 Hey! Where the hell are we?!
 Why did I wake up in a crazy place like this?!
 This is so exciting, isn't it?!
 I'm losing calories just by standing  here and getting hungry, la!
 Right... This is the first  visit here for most of you.
 This is a strong magic region,  the Yultim Volcano!
 Yul...tim?
 Lady Mereoleona, since you brought  us here, does that mean...
 You'll be training, of course!
 Of course...
 Leo! And Captain Fuegoleon?!
 It's been a while, my rival.
 I've heard of your adventures  fighting the elves and the devil.
 And I heard you were fighting on the  front lines with the Crimson Lion Kings!
 Hey, did you get a little taller?!
 Not only did I get taller,  I've grown as a Magic Knight, too!
 Hey! Well, I've gotten more muscles, too!
 Black Bulls...
 Do you have a moment?
 Vice Captain of the Crimson Lion Kings Randall Luftair
 I am the Vice Captain of the Crimson  Lion Kings, Randall Luftair.
 In the previous battle, the three of  us had our bodies taken over by elves.
 We ended up turning against all of you,  our allies. We're deeply sorry.
 What are you talking about?
 The only one to blame here is
 the devil who was manipulating the  whole situation from the shadows.
 I hear that the devil in the  Spade Kingdom is an even bigger threat.
 We will protect this kingdom as the  proud Magic Knights that we are,
 and in order to prove Asta's innocence,
 we'll all have to become stronger individually.
 Just like last time,
 we'll be training with the Crimson Lion  Kings and the others I have invited.
 Yes, ma'am!
 I wouldn't call this ""invited.""
 We were kidnapped, just like last time.
 All right! Let's haul ass to  the hot springs at the top!
 Hold it.
 Huh? Wha?!
 You won't be climbing the volcano this time.
 You'll be heading underneath the volcano...
 Yultim Volcano Underground Cave
 Into the Yultim Underground Cave!
 Yultim...
 ...Underground Cave?
 It's what makes this volcano  a strong magic region...
 An enormous mana heat  source deep underground.
 The rocks deep underground  that are soaked in this mana
 become lava due to the heat  and burst onto the surface.
 Which means the further you go underground,
 the stronger the influence of  the mana heat source becomes.
 If your Mana Skin falters,
 your bodies will be exposed  to the immense mana
 and burn up, reducing you to ashes.
 Have no fear. The goal, which is  the deepest part of the cave,
 has an even better hot spring!
 Well? Doesn't that make you excited?
 Hot... spring?
 I request that we switch over  to the sweets region where
 sweet honey flows instead of lava!
 You're not ready for that!
 It actually exists?!
 Wait. What the hell is Mana Skin?
 I dunno.
 You Magic Knights essentially  enhance your physical abilities
 with your mana to some  degree in order to fight.
 Mana Skin is the perfect  state of your basic magic.
 Flawlessly don your magic like so,
 and your body is constantly  protected by enormous mana.
 Wait, you can't expect us to  be able to do that right away!
 Then be reduced to ash.
 What?!
 For those who were brought  here unexpectedly,
 I will allow you to use this magic item.
 What's this?
 It's a magic item that'll help  you use your Mana Skins,
 but it's only a supplement.
 If you lose control of your magic,  the item's effectiveness will be lost.
 Huh?
 All right! Let the training begin!
 I will overcome this blazing mana with  my flame magic and reach the goal first!
 And I'm going to just keep  moving forward to get stronger!
 You say that, but what are you even  going to do when you can't use Mana Skin?
 That one power of yours takes a lot out  of you and doesn't last for long, right?
 If it stops working,  you'll be burnt to a crisp.
 Yeah...
 Back then, I went into my  black state by using the power
 flowing through my sword and into my body,
 but I couldn't control it at all.
 But now, I have some control over it.
 I'm going to concentrate  and control my powers
 so that I don't immediately get  sucked in by the powerful magic.
 Oh?
 He surrounded his body with anti-magic.
 All right, this will work!
 Well done, my rival!  I'm feeling even more fired up!
 Not bad, Asta!
 I've got no time to be scared!
 I'll figure out this Mana Skin  business in no time!
 Ha, so you were scared!
 Sh-Shut up! Don't make me kill you!
 Nyah, nyah, Scaredy-Cat Magna!
 Shut your stupid mouth!
 Mana Skin... I should be able to handle  that now by donning my Valkyrie Armor.
 It appears you're all prepared.
 You are the proud Magic Knights  of the Clover Kingdom.
 Get through this trial with burning  desire that surpasses even
 the heat of this strong magic region!
 Yeah!
 I'm gonna get to the goal first!
 No, it'll be me!
 No, me!
 Me!
 It'll be me!
 It'll be me!
 Hot spring...
 I won't lose, either!
 I'm gonna leave you behind if  you dawdle too long, Magna!
 Wait up, damn it!
 Let us go, too!
 Yes!
 Sneaky-sneak...
 Charmy, where are you going?
 Shh! I'm starving, so I have no interest  in going anywhere that has no food.
 I'm going to run away, la.
 Uh, but...
 I won't stop you.
 You will endure not only  scorching mana in the cave,
 but also unknown creatures that  have adapted to such conditions.
 If you have no desire to grow, then flee.
 I want to become stronger so I can  fight alongside the other Black Bulls.
 So these creatures... Are they delicious?
 I assure you that they are.
 Hell yeah!
 Just you wait, unknown ingredients that  were seasoned by the underground mana!
 Wait!
 Well... I wonder how many  of them will reach the goal.
 It's no fun for them to just  try to get to the hot spring.
 There's another reason why  I chose this underground cave
 as their training ground.
 I'm going to get to the goal first!
 There's no room! Let me pass by, Asta!
 Hot, hot, hot!
 I'm not going to lose!
 Hot, hot, hot!
 The deeper we go, the more the  mana underground increases,
 which is exhausting us  at an unbelievable rate.
 I'm starting to get dizzy from all the heat!
 At times like this...
 ...we just have to shout!
 I'm not done yet!
 I'm not going to lose, my rival!
 Actually, Nero, what the  heck did you come for?
 So that I can go into the hot spring.
 Jeez, could you be any less motivated?!
 Ugh, they're so loud!
 They're distracting me and making  me lose control of my magic.
 Calm down, calm down...
 If I get irritated, I'll lose even more control.
 Stay calm, stay calm...
 Is that all you've got?  Leo and Asta are far ahead of us!
 Let's show them what the  Crimson Lion Kings are truly made of!
 Right!
 That's the spirit!
 The heat from the mana  down here is so intense...
 Even with this magic item helping me out,
 if I let my guard down for  one second, I'm in trouble.
 My bad, Magna.
 You little shit... You did  that on purpose, didn't you?!
 I'll kill—
 I'll kill—
 I'm gonna kill you, no matter what!
 And anyway, is this really a shortcut?!
 Isn't the goal deeper underground?!
 Don't worry. The strong guy lurking  in this cave should be right up here.
 Wait... this isn't a shortcut to the goal?!
 We don't have time to fight  anything like that, you dumbass!
 How am I supposed to not fight  it when it's emitting
 such a powerful aura?
 Hi-yah!
 Nummies...
 It's so hot... My mana is being used  up much faster than I expected.
 Charmy, it's dangerous  to stay here much longer!
 La! We need to taste the unknown creatures  and replenish our mana right away!
 But you haven't been able  to catch a single thing.
 Maybe they're not here.
 Something's wrong... I sense the  unknown creatures down there.
 La! I can feel it! The ingredients  are hiding in fear of something!
 Of you, probably.
 Look out!
 It's so powerful...
 Charmy, h-hurry and let go of the net!
 I'm not letting this big one get away!
 N-Now's not the time for that...
 I can't... hold on any longer!
 La?
 La!
 You okay?
 That was a close one!
 Luck, Magna, thank you.
 H-H-H-H...
 How dare you?! I just missed out  on eating the nummies in there!
 Looks like that spider wanted  to eat you, too, Charmy.
 La?
 I think it's pretty strong. We came  here because we wanted to fight it, too.
 Speak for yourself, dumbass!
 Aw, it got away. Too bad.
 That's my line!
 So that's what the creatures here were scared of.
 Just you wait!
 Not yet...
 You sound out of breath, my rival.
 And you're barely staying on your feet.
 I'm nearing my limit...  But my rival is also suffering.
 I'm getting to the goal first!
 No, it'll be me!
 Reinforcement Magic: Leg Strength Boost!
 Pardon me!
 Wha—
 She's so fast!
 With the mana in here being this powerful,
 it's the worst possible compatibility  with my water magic.
 I'm having a harder time getting  through than I thought.
 How are our magic levels so different  when we're both royalty?
 But I will not lose!
 Not yet! Hold up, Noelle!
 I can't let this get to me if  I want to be the Wizard King!
 Asta!
 The moment I first met you...
 Listen up, you bastards!
 I'm going to pile up merit,
 become the Wizard King,
 and shut you all up!
 Despite that you were  a peasant with no magic,
 I felt something in my heart  when you told of us your dreams.
 Ever since then, we've fought together,  trained together,
 and competed against each  other to reach new heights.
 But then, when I tried to become  a member of the Royal Knights
 to take down the Eye of the Midnight Sun, who killed my brother,
 I was not chosen.
 I will train even harder,  catch up to all of you,
 and surpass you!
 Leopold...
 I will get revenge for Captain Fuegoleon,  no matter what!
 With that frustration still in my heart,
 I've continued training hard to this day.
 I'm going to catch up to you!
 We're still not at the goal?
 I can't keep this up much longer.
 Hold up, Noelle!
 I-I'm royalty! I may make others wait,  but I don't wait for anyone!
 Wait up!
 Swim trunks?!
 N-No, it couldn't be! I must be seeing things.
 Noelle!
 What?!
 Stay calm... Calm down and take another look...
 Wait up, Noelle!
 Let's go swim together!
 I'm seeing nothing but the ocean!
 G-Get a grip, me!
 We're in a cave! A cave! We're not at the beach!
 What's wrong?!
 No!
 What?!
 Whoa!
 What the heck was that for?!
 Hey, Noelle! Where'd you go?!
 Honestly... Th-That was his fault  for talking to me out of nowhere.
 The mana seems calmer in here.
 I wonder why...
 Asta?
 Was it my imagination?
 Asta?!
 You okay? What the heck is that monster?!
 Crap—
 Asta!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 I missed?!
 Take this!
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 Leopold!
 You okay?!
 You can stand, can't you, Leo?
 Yes.
 You never look this happy after  our daily training sessions.
 Really?
 That bug is a mutant that  recently showed up and has been
 eating up all the creatures around here.
 I wanted to teach it a lesson,
 but I'm sure it's able to sense  those that are stronger than it is.
 It never shows itself before me.
 So I decided to try to throw you lot in here.
 It attacked you, thinking you  were food, just as I planned.
 How could you do something like that?!
 If you knew that thing was down here,  you should've told us—
 Don't be naïve!
 The unexpected always happens in battle!
 Not to mention, we're going to be  facing a devil from another world!
 How do you expect to survive  if you can't even handle this?
 True... I didn't picture  this as an actual battle.
 I can't argue with that.
 Or so I'd like to say...
 But it appears that bug isn't a mere mutant.
 That thing has man-made mana within it.  Mana it wasn't born with.
 And...
 That must be how it kept hiding from you.
 Elaborate camouflage that  even I couldn't see through...
 Must be an ancient curse.
 Don't tell me that's...
 A dungeon, eh? Things are getting exciting.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 I'll Surpass You
 I'll Surpass You.
 Asta! I've made up my mind to catch  up to you and surpass you immediately!
 Scenario 1
 Scenario 1!
 Captain Yami! I can't hold it any longer! Please come out!
 See ya!
 What?!
 You didn't surpass me! You cut in line!
 Scenario 2
 Scenario 2!
 Let's dig in!
 Hey, where's your food?
 Ha! I surpassed you in eating!
 You just didn't eat!
 Scenario 3
 And scenario 3!
 Actually, I'm just gonna surpass  that and go to scenario 100!
 No, 10,000!
 You went too far!
 A dungeon?!
 Just watch, Asta, my rival.
 I will conquer it first!
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 133:  ""The Lion Awakens, Continued.""

133,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 Mereoleona showed up at the  Black Bulls' hideout without warning,
 stealing away Asta and the others.
 Their destination was the strong  magic region, the Yultim Volcano.
 This was where Asta and Noelle
 had trained with the  Crimson Lion Kings before.
 Mereoleona and Fuegoleon announced that  they would be training here yet again,
 in order to prepare to fight the devil.
 Let's haul ass to the hot springs at the top!
 Hold it.
 Wha?!
 You won't be climbing the volcano this time.
 You'll be heading underneath the volcano...
 Into the Yultim Underground Cave!
 They ended up facing an intensely fiery  mana unlike any they faced before
 as they headed toward their goal,  the hot springs.
 But...
 Take this!
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 Leopold's powerful attack was enough  to make the spider monster back down,
 but then they discovered  the cave's surprising secret.
 Don't tell me that's...
 A dungeon, eh? Things are getting exciting.
 The Lion Awakens, Continued
 Lady Mereoleona, what is that?
 You're late!
 Did you enjoy your nice little stroll with  the Black Bulls, you pathetic fools?!
 And you call yourselves Crimson Lion Kings?!
 We're terribly sorry.
 If it were just just Vice Captain Randall  and me, we could've gotten here faster.
 We are unworthy.
 And... who gave you permission to eat?
 Munchy, munchy, munchy...
 Watch it, Miz Charmy!  You gotta read the room!
 We've already reported to the royal  capital that we found a dungeon.
 Stand by for further instructions.
 Yes, sir!
 Huh?
 You guys were attacked by  that giant spider, too?
 Yup.
 Who would've thought it'd  run away into a dungeon?
 Isn't it exciting?
 How?!
 I was a fool to let that spider escape.
 I cannot let it end like this!
 Sister!
 Let us explore the dungeon!
 Don't get cocky!
 You're the foolish, inexperienced  weakling who let that bug escape!
 You have some nerve saying that to me!
 I promise that I will succeed next time!
 There is no next time in battle!
 Go whip yourself back into  shape in that dungeon!
 Yes, ma'am!
 I see she's still as fired up as ever!
 So she's letting him go into the dungeon after all.
 Eyes up here!
 Captain Fuegoleon filled me in on the situation.
 It appears that a rather powerful magic  item lies deep within that dungeon.
 According to a book that Master  Julius found in the library,
 that magic item was sealed away deep in
 the Yultim Volcano by those who  feared it would be used for evil.
 Otherwise, it's shrouded in mystery.  Little is known about it.
 Yes, that's right!
 Honestly!
 Could you please be quiet?!
 Oh, sorry about that. But won't it be exciting  to find out what the magic item is?
 Shh!
 Let me head over there, too.
 Absolutely not!
 What? But I'll wear a disguise!
 That's not the issue here.
 Who's he talking to?
 No idea...
 It's the Wizard King!
 It sure is.
 A-Anyway, the magic item and any other  treasure you happen to find in the dungeon
 will be essential to getting  this kingdom back on its feet.
 I'm counting on all of you to investigate it.
 Understood.
 Now, then—
 Listen up, you fools!
 You will carry out this investigation  with your pride as the Magic Knights
 who protect this kingdom on the line!
 Yes, ma'am!
 Sister, as the current Captain of the  Crimson Lion Kings, I'll tell them the rest.
 Right. Hurry up and tell them the plan.
 The first group to go in will be
 Asta, Noelle,
 Leo, Randall,
 Luck, and Magna. You will search for  the location where the magic item sleeps.
 The rest of you will rendezvous with the  first group as soon as your mana has recovered.
 And I'm going to sneak a peek...
 You absolutely will not.
 All right, let's go!
 Yeah!
 So hot...
 It's so damn hot! It's nothing  like the heat from earlier.
 I still don't sense that spider's mana.
 But...
 Well done, my rival!
 I see you've already taken out the first one!
 That wasn't my intention at all!
 We'll be in trouble if we get  stalled here for too long.
 He held back just enough so that  the trap spells wouldn't activate.
 I can't believe he pulled off such  a high-level spell so easily.
 He's definitely the Vice Captain  of the Crimson Lion Kings!
 Now we can clearly see where all the traps are!
 Catch you guys later!
 Lightning Creation Magic: Holy Lightning Boots!
 Now, hold on a second!
 Flame Reinforcement Magic: Risky Stolen Base!
 Hey! Stop stepping on those on purpose!
 Only two more paths remain!
 My rival, let us compete to see which  one of us finds the magic item first!
 Heck yeah!
 How can he move so well in this  space that's filled with so much mana?
 Vice Captain Randall, let us hurry!
 Sure.
 But I must say,
 I guess it's obvious that you've trained  harder than any other member of our squad.
 This is still not enough to catch  up to and someday exceed my rival!
 In the last battle, Asta not only  fought with a devil, but defeated it!
 I heard that the other Black Bulls also  fought valiantly in the last battle.
 This is not enough.
 I see now.
 So that's why Captain Fuegoleon  and Lady Mereoleona
 invited the Black Bulls to this training.
 Leo! I think you came close to a  realization in that last battle yourself.
 When you fought against me after  my body was taken over by an elf.
 What in the world is this  incredibly violent mana?
 Let's go see.
 Noelle! This is only going to get worse!
 Let's just break through!
 We're in a dungeon! That might  be easy for a meathead like you,
 but you're asking me for the impossible!
 Then let me carry you!
 Huh?!
 I'll carry you on my back to get us  outta here, so just back me up!
 C-C-C-Carry me on your back?!  Wh-What are you saying?!
 I'm royalty!
 Noelle!
 A-Asta?
 Wait, why are we turning around?
 We're pulling back for now!
 This is...
 Look.
 Those must be the golems that  were guarding this place.
 Be careful.
 That shock wave almost made it seem  as if it was telling us where it is.
 It might actually be trying to lure us in.
 There you are! I won't let you escape again!
 That conniving little...
 Well, this is interesting.
 I will burn them all to ashes  with my raging inferno!
 We've neutralized all of the  trap spells by the entrance.
 All right. Recover your mana,  and then widen the search.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Go on, eat up!
 Did you find anything?
 Not a thing.
 Because of Asta, we ended up having  to run away from lava. It was awful.
 That's my fault?!
 We came up empty-handed, too. Though we  did find a bunch of weird-ass treasure chests.
 Here you go!
 What in the world?
 Why the hell did you bring that  back?! Don't you dare open it!
 Close that thing already!
 Is that yummy?
 Y-You probably shouldn't find out.
 What was that?
 The only ones from the first group who  haven't returned are Randall and Leo.
 Sounds like they hit the jackpot.
 Let's do this, Leo!
 Right!
 Go up in flames!
 There are just too many.
 We are the proud Crimson Lion Kings!  Running from our enemies is not an option!
 Wait!
 Leo!
 Randall!
 Leo, fall back.
 You have to survive this.
 Leo, you're going to lead this squad one day.
 We'll buy you some time.
 Take everyone who can't  fight right now and survive!
 It's just like last time.
 Why did I bother to train so hard?
 This is...
 Leo! I think you came close to a  realization in that last battle yourself.
 That's right... I was fighting  within the powerful mana
 that Randall created during that fight.
 None of my attacks seemed to work,
 but I learned to read his mana and  calmly control my flames!
 Leo!
 Are you okay?
 Asta!
 All right, let's get a little wild!
 Hope you guys are ready, because  I'm killing you even if you're not!
 One never forgets their grudge  when it comes to food!
 You will pay for eating all those  never-before-seen ingredients!
 How dare you do that to my friend?
 All right, let's begin our counterattack!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 My spell seems more powerful...  Could it be from all my training?
 Eat this! Flame Magic:  Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!
 Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!
 Poison Curse Magic:  Dwelling of the Poison Cloud!
 Cotton Creation Magic:  Strike of the Sleeping Sheep!
 Secure Leopold and Randall!
 Roger!
 There are even more of them?
 We've gotta do something about that  spider controlling them with its web!
 Let's do this one more time!
 No.
 I'll go.
 I'm going to use what I realized  then, right here and now.
 By heightening his senses to their limits  and calmly reading the flow of mana,
 Leopold can momentarily use  the mana around him in his favor,
 which allows him to explosively increase his mana!
 Th-That was amazing!
 Leo!
 So this is the spider's original form.
 It appears that the magic item here  makes the user's life force go berserk,
 and turns them into a monster.
 Excellent work finding the treasure room.
 All of the hardships you dealt with here
 will surely aid you in the  fight against the devil!
 Yes, sir!
 I think I'm starting to get the  hang of this Mana Skin thing!
 And I could actually see that  my spells were more powerful.
 Speaking of spells, that last spell  Leo used was frickin' insane!
 I was preoccupied with  what was going on.
 What was that spell?
 If I can learn to use that spell at will...
 Praise me even more, my rival!
 I will learn how to fully use that  spell and become stronger than you!
 In that case, I'll become  even stronger than that!
 That only means I'll become  even stronger yet again!
 And then, I'll get even more  and more and more stronger!
 Then I'll become even more and  more and more and more stronger!
 More, more, more, more, more...
 Quit your shouting!
 Yes, ma'am!
 This discussion isn't over yet.
 Show me the magic item that you acquired.
 Oh, here you go.
 What is that garbage?
 Huh? It's the magic item we were after.
 You absolute fools!
 Retrieving the magic item was the  number one goal of this mission!
 How dare you reduce it to cinders?!
 Right...
 We're terribly sorry.
 You two are going to go search every  corner of that dungeon on your own.
 I will not allow you to return empty-handed!
 Yes, ma'am!
 Uh, wait. You're joking, right?
 She's serious.
 She's completely serious.
 Pretty sure she's dead serious.
 The rest of you fools head to the hot springs!
 Yes, ma'am!
 Have a drink.
 Go on, down the hatch.
 A special drink that'll quench any thirst,
 made from the extracts of every single  ingredient I found in that dungeon.
 I guess I get to enjoy this nice bath again.
 Looks like you've gotten closer.
 Huh?
 To your mother, that is.
 Your form in our last battle...
 It reminded me of Lady Acier, who was  called the Steel Warrior Princess.
 But you've still got a ways to go.
 Your magic is not up to par yet.
 Er, right.
 Your mother, Acier Silva, lost her  life due to a devil's curse.
 Because those who speak of  it will share the same fate.
 That's the nature of the curse  that befell your mother.
 But I want to become even stronger.
 I must become stronger!
 I see.
 U-Um... Would you tell me more about my mother?
 That might take a while.
 That's fine!
 Doesn't this feel great?
 You know, the Captain of the Crimson  Lion Kings is the total opposite
 of Captain Yami. Way too uptight.
 Listen well! Hot springs are far  more profound than you realize!
 Yes, sir!
 Stay calm, even if you become overheated.
 Learn to determine when  you have warmed up enough,
 discipline your body and soul with cold water,  and then return to the bath.
 Consider this an opportunity  to train in facing yourself!
 Yes, sir!
 You must never forget to cleanse  your body before soaking.
 Never let your towel touch the water.
 When you're done using  the shower and bathing area,
 I-I'm at my limit...
 make sure to rinse them off with hot water.
 How much longer is he going to keep talking?
 Make sure you leave things as you found them.
 I wonder if Asta and Leopold are back yet.
 Nothing beats washing each other's backs  to deepen your friendship at a hot spring.
 So we kept looking until morning  and still didn't find anything.
 Was the bath that nice?
 I managed to sweat all my exhaustion away.
 All the collagen from the ingredients  I found made my skin silky smooth!
 True. If the place wasn't in a strong  magic region, I'd like to visit every day.
 Your skin's all silky smooth, too, Noelle.
 Y-You're way too close!
 That was a lot of fun, wasn't it? I wonder  when our next training session will be!
 The hell are you talking about?
 She just dragged us away  outta nowhere. It totally sucked.
 I hope I don't even see her face for a while.
 Wouldn't it be funny if she was waiting inside?
 Like that'd ever happ—
 You're late!
 She's actually here!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Reinvestigation
 Reinvestigation!
 Where the heck is the treasure?!
 There's nothing but super-weird treasure chests!
 Behold, my rival! I have  found an amazing treasure!
 Look at how long its legs are!
 Whoa, holy crap! In that case...
 I found one that's all buff and hairy!
 What?!
 And it'll even do squats with me!
 Impressive, my rival. Let us compete to see  who can find the ultimate treasure chest!
 Bring it on!
 Where is it?! Where is it?!  Where is it?! Where is it?!
 Forgetting the reason they went in,
 Asta and Leopold ran around  the dungeon until morning.
 Today is such an important day  for the House of Vermillion that
 it may mean life or death!
 Yes! We will be welcoming her!
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 134:  ""Those Who Have Been Gathered.""

134,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 Asta and some of the other Black Bulls  were gathered up by Mereoleona,
 and taken away to train along  with the Crimson Lion Kings.
 I'm gonna get to the goal first!
 No, it'll be me!
 No, me!
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 During their training, a new  dungeon appeared before them.
 Things are getting exciting.
 That was amazing!
 Leopold, who sees himself as Asta's rival,
 showed great growth as they  conquered the dungeon.
 I will learn how to fully use that  spell and become stronger than you!
 In that case, I'll become  even stronger than that!
 And thus, their training ended.
 Or so they thought...
 You're late!
 She's actually here!
 What the heck's going on?!
 Take care, Asta.
 You've been chosen to deal with an  urgent matter of grave importance.
 You should be honored.
 Those Who Have Been Gathered
 Vermillion Residence
 You two, hurry up and take a seat.
 Wait, where are we?
 The Vermillion residence.  In other words, my home.
 Hey, it's Mimosa, Mimosa's bro,  and Captain Fuegoleon.
 I see that you've been summoned as well, Asta.
 Uh, more like we were dragged here, but...
 Ah, Asta. You're as unsightly as ever,  and now, a wanted fugitive.
 But I guess I must admit that your recent deeds  may have been at least a little beautiful.
 Th-Thanks?
 I believe that was my brother's  attempt to compliment you.
 So... why are we all here?
 I'm not sure, but...
 Captain Fuegoleon...
 I may be guessing, but this seems quite serious.
 Yeah...
 Maybe we're receiving special orders  regarding the Spade Kingdom.
 Oh, yeah!
 Silence!
 We are about to hold a very important meeting.
 I need you to understand
 that the results of this meeting will  affect the very future of our kingdom.
 You must make sure you tell no one of this.
 This must be a top-secret mission!
 Now, let us begin!
 Theresa Rapual
 The old sister lady?
 Um... May I ask who she is?
 She's one of the sisters  from the church in Nean...
 But why is she here?
 This meeting is to celebrate Ms. Theresa's  fifteen years in the sisterhood.
 What?!
 But wait, you guys just said this will  affect the very future of our kingdom!
 Ms. Theresa is currently raising  children, who have a future.
 So, as I said, this affects the  very future of our kingdom.
 Well, I guess that's true, but...
 Why must we not mention this to anyone else?
 We're not saying to keep this a complete secret.
 We just mean that there's really  no reason to tell others.
 Ms. Theresa dislikes flashiness and  things that bring attention to her.
 It isn't a secret mission at all!
 This is already too flashy and grandiose.
 I just want some peace.
 So basically, we're just  having a party to celebrate?
 Why did you decide to host this, Fuegoleon?
 When I was young, Ms. Theresa was in  charge of my sister's and my education
 while doing her duties as a Magic Knight.
 Oh, I guess you did mention  that before, Granny.
 Good grief. If nothing else,  your heads sure have gotten bigger,
 Mereo and Fueggy.
 Mereo?!
 Fueggy?!
 After retiring from being our  tutor and a Magic Knight,
 today marks fifteen years  since you became a sister.
 I also heard that you acted
 valiantly during the kidnapping  incident that occurred in Nean.
 Granny was super amazing back then!
 We will celebrate her greatness and  honor her lifelong achievements today.
 We called you lot here to help celebrate.
 I finally figured it all out!
 In that case, we need to make  this a huge celebration!
 Y-Yeah.
 Yes.
 How beautiful...
 I'm not talking about your looks,
 but there is beauty residing  in your proud spirit!
 I'm finally beginning to  understand that kind of beauty.
 But of course, I'm still the most beautiful!
 It may be too late, but would you  consider educating my brother, too?
 By the way, why isn't Leo here?
 This is a party to celebrate someone  really important to his siblings.
 Under ordinary circumstances,  we would have summoned him here,
 but he requested that he be allowed  further training, which I granted.
 Oh, I see.
 That boy's got a good head on his shoulders.
 You two don't have time to waste  on nonsense like this either, do you?
 This celebration is just  for today. Please enjoy it.
 Whoa! This all looks super good!
 Ms. Theresa, please enjoy.
 It could be because I've been away  from the royal capital for so long,
 but I really don't care for fancy meals like this.
 This is exactly why I thought about declining.
 But...
 It's a feast!
 Wow!
 It looks so yummy!
 You offered to feed my  little ones, so I couldn't say no.
 Marie! And the other kids!
 Asta! Thank you for helping us before!
 Let's eat together!
 Sure!
 Wait...
 This ki...
 Asta! Come on, hurry up!
 Huh? Oh, sure.
 Come on, line up!
 Okay!
 Here you go. This is yours, Marie.
 Thank you, Asta!
 Tch!
 What do you think you're doing?
 You may have fooled the others,
 but did you really think  you could fool me, Gauche?
 Shut it, you old hag.
 I'm guessing you had some transformation  wizard help you transform into a kid.
 I'm pretty sure I remember your  squad having someone like that.
 I went to the church because  I wanted to see Marie,
 but then I heard there was  a party being held here.
 That's why I'm here. You got a  problem with that, you shitty old hag?
 I see you're as foul-mouthed as ever.
 You're fully aware that you're only  allowed to see Marie once a month.
 How desperate are you to see her,  you sister-obsessed punk?
 This doesn't count as my one time a month if  I'm just sneaking a peek, you wicked old hag.
 Sorry to interrupt the fun, but...
 What?! The party's already over?
 No, that's not it.
 Uh, then what is it?
 I need you all to do a party trick  that will delight Ms. Theresa!
 Wha?
 Now, show us your party tricks!
 He wants us to do... party tricks?
 He wants me to do a party trick?!
 What do tricks have to do with parties?!
 Fueggy's always been  a bit on the awkward side,
 so he doesn't know how else to phrase things.
 Though I'd like to ask all of you  to entertain the children, too.
 So we just gotta entertain everyone?
 Let's do this.
 Leave this to me. My beauty always  quenches the masses' thirst for entertainment.
 In your case, my dear brother, your whole  existence is like a party trick,
 so you don't have to change a thing.
 You flatter me, my dear sister.
 Really? A party trick out of nowhere?
 I absolutely did not.
 At times like this, you mother, Lady Acier,  would've been the first to act.
 At any banquet, she would entertain  us all with a brilliant party trick.
 I'll do it!
 I'm very excited to see  your party trick, Noelle!
 You've got this, Noelle!
 I'll show you how royalty does a party trick!
 There!
 S-Something like this?
 I guess that should do the trick.
 Wow!
 Do more!
 I shall go next.
 They're so lame. I could  entertain Marie so much better.
 You shut your mouth.
 Though, if you ask me, the fact that  you've disguised yourself as a child
 is probably the most hilarious thing here.
 You never shut up, do you, old hag?
 Oh, so that's what a party trick is!
 All right, I've got this!
 Noelle! Throw me two plates!
 Huh? Sure...
 Hup!
 I'm not done yet!
 Wow!
 Brilliant, Asta!
 He's getting the biggest reaction.  Not bad, I guess.
 What a bizarre party trick. I almost  feel beauty in how unsightly it is.
 Okay, guys! Here comes the next one! Up they go!
 That's so cool!
 Well done, all of you. I thank you.
 You're the best!
 So, what party trick are you  going to do for me, Fueggy?
 It appears that I cannot get  away with doing nothing.
 All right, I'll have to use the ace up my sleeve.
 Behold!
 See these eggs?
 What the heck is Captain Fuegoleon doing?
 Does he actually think he's boiling them?
 There.
 Behold!
 A hard-boiled egg, a soft-boiled egg,  and a jammy soft-boiled egg!
 By carefully controlling my mana,
 I can prepare eggs in three  different ways at once!
 The jammy soft-boiled egg is  the most difficult to execute.
 To give the yolk a soft firmness while  keeping the white in a gelatinous state,
 one must control the heat in the exact—
 Boring.
 What?
 You're far too serious.
 You have no talent for this sort of thing at all.
 Sister...
 Just watch. I'll show you how it's done.
 One must have the right enthusiasm  when pulling off a party trick.
 This is how it's done!
 Well? Are you not entertained?
 Sister!
 That lady's mean!
 Why in the world are you crying?
 I see you two are as clueless as ever.
 I apologize for this shameful display.
 But I can see that you haven't changed.
 Nothing has changed at all  since I looked after you two.
 What were they like back then?
 Come on, Asta...
 Well, they were very capable, but still  a handful. That's how I'd describe them.
 I'm going to be your tutor starting today.  I look forward to it.
 Ms. Theresa! I must become stronger!
 So please, train me harder!
 Don't be ridiculous, Fueggy.
 No one can become strong overnight.
 Fueggy seemed unsatisfied with my training
 and would always sneak around,
 training more on his own.
 Training too much when you're too young  affects your mana and your growth,
 so I struggled to get him to hold back.
 As for Mereo, she was always a wild child.
 She never listened to me  anyway, so I let her be,
 and she became overpowered on her own.
 I was their tutor for about ten years,
 until Fueggy was fifteen  and Mereo was seventeen.
 I do apologize for being such an unruly student, Ms. Theresa.
 Because you let me have my freedom back then,
 I was able to become strong without  being stuck in constraints.
 I'm very grateful to you, Ms. Theresa.
 I just did my job as your tutor.
 You're amazing, Granny,
 but I guess they've been amazing  ever since they were kids, too!
 That's not true.
 Fueggy couldn't control his mana,
 so he'd always set things on fire.
 What?!
 I remember that. And every time you  started a fire, you'd cry like a baby.
 And when you were about eight, Mereo,
 you got too worked up and set  your own clothes on fire.
 I do believe I recall that happening.
 I do remember that, Sister.
 When you're born with overwhelming mana,
 that's bound to happen when  you're still children.
 But as you grow, eventually,  you naturally become able to control it.
 I see! So compared to others,  I was just a late bloomer.
 I see! So it's like getting  over wetting the bed!
 Once you're older than ten, it mostly  calms down, but there are those kids
 who still wet the bed at,  like, thirteen or fourteen.
 Yes, exactly. It's similar to that.
 Yeah! So just like wetting the bed!
 How dare you, Stupidsta?!
 Ow!
 Why the heck did I just get slapped?!
 Well, all kids have a couple of  embarrassing memories like that.
 Speaking of embarrassing memories,  I happen to remember Fuegoleon
 breaking a vase that was a  precious family heirloom.
 I actually took the blame for it  so he wouldn't get in trouble.
 I beg your pardon, dear sister,
 but it was you who actually broke  the vase and blamed it on me.
 I know it happened a long time ago,  but I cannot allow you to forget it.
 Oho, so that's how you think you remember it.
 It's not how I remember it.  It is the simple truth.
 When you took Father's precious magic  item without permission and lost it,
 you also blamed that on me, didn't you, Sister?
 Enough of your rubbish. Have you  forgotten that I'd let you off the hook
 every single time you took a  portion from my dinner plate?
 That is also wrong.
 You were actually constantly  taking a portion from
 my dinner plate without permission.
 You may be my sister, but I will not  allow for any more of these falsities.
 Falsities? Watch your mouth, Fuegoleon.
 I would also like you to take back what you said.
 It looks like I'm going to have to  physically teach you a lesson again.
 I would like to see you try.
 This is really bad!
 What's new about siblings fighting?  Just let them have at it.
 Though... You there, missy.
 Huh? Me?
 I don't want these kids to get hurt, so could you protect them with your magic?
 A-All right.
 Take a good, long look, kids.  Don't end up like them.
 Okay!
 It's not uncommon for kids to  remember things differently.
 I, too, protected Mimosa quite  often when we were children,
 but it appears as though my  dear sister has forgotten!
 What? When did you ever protect me?
 For example, the time I beautified  a room after Mimosa sullied it.
 Oh, really?
 I must ask you to stop!
 Especially in front of Asta!
 Not to mention, every time you  claimed to be practicing magic
 while littering flower petals all over the  house, it was I who cleaned them all up!
 I do believe that's just a matter of opinion.
 Could you please stop playing dumb?!
 I am beautiful, and therefore,  I do not like conflict.
 However, I shall not allow  you to slander my good name.
 I am tired of your excuses, Brother,
 so I shall gladly shut your mouth for you.
 I'm not sure I've ever seen Mimosa like this.  I guess strange things do happen.
 I'm done holding back.
 Oh? Looks like you'll at least  be able to entertain me.
 Hey, you jackasses!  You're putting Marie in danger!
 Whoa! Gauche?!
 What are you doing here?
 I won't let any of you get  a chance to hurt Marie!
 Mind your own business! I'm in the middle  of disciplining my idiot of a brother!
 This is getting way out of hand, you two!
 That's enough!
 Whoa...
 She completely stopped all  the fights in an instant!
 Sit!
 Honestly, all siblings fight,  but there are limits!
 I'm terribly sorry that I lost my  composure with you, Brother.
 Nay, I just failed to be beautiful.
 As for you two, it seems like  you need a stern talking-to.
 You're both over thirty!
 Stop fighting hard enough to  bring your own house down!
 We're terribly sorry.
 Hey, hang on a damn second, you old hag.
 Why the hell do you look so smug?
 Oh, I was wondering where you went.
 You only got in trouble
 because you came here when you're  not supposed to, Big Brother!
 Marie!
 I'm glad your sister is so much  more intelligent than you.
 Good work, you two.
 Thank you for looking out for the children.
 N-No problem, ma'am.
 Well, it's about time we headed home.
 Ms. Theresa! Are you heading home already?
 I've had enough of you two for today.
 I apologize again for our rudeness.
 So please, allow us to do  something nice for you again.
 This only happened because you tried to  do something you're not accustomed to.
 It's true that we're inexperienced, but...
 But I'll gladly accept your feelings, you two.
 How about...
 you celebrate my hundred years  of continued service in about 85 years?
 The Crimson She-Leopard is so damn cool!
 I'm pretty sure she could  take down a devil on her own.
 That was so much fun!
 I haven't lived all these years as an  old hag with nothing to show for it.
 Another mixer?

 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 To defeat the devil Megicula,  who inhabits the Spade Kingdom,
 Asta and the others have been training hard.
 Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Spiral Flames!
 The Queen of the Heart Kingdom, Loropechika,  who had been cursed by Megicula,
 gave them six months.
 In that span of time, Asta and the  others must surpass their limits.
 I'm so beat!
 And hungry...
 Well done on your training, Asta.
 Finral?
 I-Is something wrong?
 Well, you see...
 I'm actually cursed, too!
 What?!
 You're not actually cursed.
 You just have an incurable  case of girl-craziness.
 Noelle! You're as beautiful as ever tod— er...
 That's exactly the part you need to fix, Finral!
 See?
 That! That! That! That!
 You're right.
 Y-Y-You've got it all wrong!
 Langris told me...
 You're cursed!
 What?!
 You're a hopeless playboy who hits  on any woman in your path!
 Playboy
 P-Playboy?
 All that running away and trying
 to act cool made you a bigger  failure than you already were!
 Failure
 Failure?
 And once you pick up bad habits,  they won't be easy to break!
 Bad Habits
 Bad habits?
 How could someone like you with so  many faults make Miss Finnes happy?!
 See?
 I already have my heart set on someone.
 I can't let this curse plague me forever.
 Otherwise, I won't be able to make  Miss Finnes happy, just like Langris said.
 Isn't that the person Captain Yami mentioned?
 I never thought Finral could  be so serious about someone.
 Asta, please.
 I need to defeat this curse,
 so join me in training to  make my heart stronger!
 Finral...
 Ow!
 Heck yeah, I will!
 Let's beat this curse out of you  so you can be the man she deserves!
 Asta...
 Training to make his heart stronger?
 The Dreavy Hinker
 Cheers!
 Of course it's a damn mixer!
 The One Who Has My Heart,  My Mind, and Soul
 I had no idea! Apparently mixers  make your heart stronger!
 I really hope I get to fight this time!
 Rebecca Scarlet
 To think that Asta would invite me to  a mixer... I wonder what brought this on.
 I'm not going to complain  about the chance, though!
 Karen Lapis
 When the heck did Rebecca get so  friendly with the Magic Knights?
 I just want to get married already. I don't even care who it's with.
 Eliza Zakkeroni
 I have no interest in real men.
 I only showed up because I was invited.
 I just want to go back home  and read the rest of my novel.
 It'd be rude if I didn't try  to sweet-talk these women
 on this battlefield known as a ""mixer.""
 Therefore, it's the perfect training for me.
 I will do my absolute best  to overcome this curse.
 Training? Please. I almost  changed my mind about him.
 It's a good thing I came  along because I was worried.
 But wait, what am I even worried about?!
 Asta, you've got something on your face.
 Wh-What's going on over there?!
 Wait, stop! You're going to bring our  shop down in more ways than one!
 Silence, you puny insect.
 Why did I bother hiring you again?
 A-Anyway, break anything else  in here, and you're fired!
 Nero! Why are you here?
 Just because.
 Just because?
 I can't have you underestimating  the work of a waitress—
 Sh-She's actually really cute!
 If Asta sees Nero looking this cute,  he might end up f-f-f-f-f-f-fa...
 Noelle?
 I-I'm going to go check out Asta's table.  You take care of the other ones.
 Wh-Why am I trying to keep Nero and Asta apart?
 It doesn't matter to me one bit  who Asta falls in love with!
 Hey there, missy!
 Get me another beer, will ya?
 Fetch it yourself, you insect.
 Hey, you're the girl from before!
 Here you are, sir.
 A-An angel...
 Hey, what are you doing? It's your  turn to introduce yourself, Finral!
 Oh, I just came here to eat today.
 What?!
 Honestly... I just wanted  to enjoy some quiet time,
 but you two had to drag me out here.
 Say what?!
 Yikes... There's always  at least one clueless guy
 who thinks this is the cool thing to do.
 I'm pretty sure he was the  gaudiest one at our last mixer.
 B-But since we're all enjoying a meal together,
 I'd love to hear about you  being a Magic Knight, Finral—
 Yeah... that's not my thing.
 What's not your thing?!
 This hurts so bad!
 A girl is actually interested,  and having to ignore her is just torture!
 But this is all part of my training,  training, training!
 Hurgh!
 M-My right hand is desperately trying to give  her some flowers like I usually would.
 Calm yourself, right hand!
 Curses! It's just in my very  nature to try to hit on girls!
 What is this guy trying to do?
 I-I see! Finral's doing his absolute  best to battle his curse right now!
 I wonder when we're gonna start fighting.
 Looks like things might be okay after all.
 My bad! Sorry I'm late, bah-ha!
 I've been super busy lately. I mean,  this kingdom was in peril just the other day!
 I can't really talk about it since  it's top secret, bah-hanestly.
 But I'm the one who saved everyone.
 < Lies >
 I mean, I'm the one who fixed all  the Magic Knights that went crazy.
 < Lies >
 It's only a matter of time until  they make me a captain, bah-ha!
 Bah-ha! It's such a pain, but it's my job.
 It appears the king has  taken quite a liking to me.
 < This is true >
 Whoops. I just said it was top secret,  but I think I might've said too much.
 And you were reading a dirty  magazine again during all that,
 though I can't say much more. Bah-ha!
 You clearly just told her.
 A mysterious guy is always more charming.
 I see they're putting on their  hellish display of a mixer again.
 Oh, of course! Sorry, it just slipped!
 Um... What was his name again?
 According to the guys who  went to the Heart Kingdom,
 apparently there's some secret  behind my bronze magic.
 Good grief! It looks like I'm the  only guy who can save the world.
 I'm starting to scare even myself, bah-ha-ha!
 Oh, right. His name's Bah-ha-ha.
 You there! Bring us some  more drinks, bah-hay-bee!
 But I was really shocked when I  read that article about you, Asta.
 I figured it was some kind of mistake, but...
 Well, it wasn't totally a mistake.  They are planning to execute me.
 E-Execute you?!
 Oh, it's not a huge deal, though.
 So don't worry about it, Rebecca.
 Hey, so you came to this mixer  to get stronger, too, right?
 Wanna fight me?
 Huh? Wh-What's he talking about?  Is ""fight"" some kind of code word?
 I-I think we should get to  know each other better first.
 Huh?
 I wanna have some fun  conversations with girls, too!
 No, no, no, what are you saying, Finral?!
 The fact that I haven't tried  to pick up a girl once yet
 makes this training a huge success!
 Then again, I do feel bad for  the girls who actually showed up.
 I'll need to explain everything  and apologize later.
 It's you...
 Huh?
 My ideal partner actually exists in real life!
 Wh-What?!
 Take these to table 3—  W-Wait, you gonna be okay?
 That other one never works,  but this girl has what it takes!
 Here you are.
 Isn't he from the Golden Dawn?
 Thank you very much.
 What is he doing here?
 U-Um...
 Girls from the Blue Rose Knights?
 Thank you for wait—
 The Captain of the Blue Rose Knights...  And the Captain of the Black Bulls?
 Does this have to do with the  investigation of the devils?
 I appreciate my knights holding  this dinner party for me, but...
 This is great. It's even better knowing  the Blue Rose Knights are paying for it.
 You can say that again!  Anyway, I wonder where Asta went!
 I was totally gonna invite him.
 Did they really just come here to eat?
 I heard that this was supposed  to be a dinner party,
 but seeing how we're lined up, and seeing  Captain Charlotte all dressed up...
 This is totally a mixer, isn't it?
 Let's have a blast today.
 P-Please take it easy on me.
 I want Sis to be happy, but I don't  want a guy stealing Sis away from me!
 What the heck am I supposed to do?!
 You're gonna get a stomachache  if you eat that fast.
 Mind your own business, Funglasquent!
 Again, stop trying to abbreviate  ""Funny Glasses Delinquent,"" you giant woman!
 I'm actually worried about you here.
 You have no idea how I feel!
 Uh, what?
 This calls for an eating contest, Glasquent!
 B-Bring it on, Giant Woman!
 Doesn't this dress show too much skin?
 No, I need to believe in Puli's advice.
 Member of the Blue Rose Knights and a  4th Class Junior Magic Knight, Puli Angel.
 She actually has another side  to her personality.
 Countless Magic Knights have gone  to her for relationship advice.
 Puli was acting as a Cupid, or rather,
 an angel of love, just as her name suggests,
 and saving poor lambs lost in their quest to find love.
 You're more beautiful today  than ever, Captain Charlotte.
 Captain Yami doesn't stand a chance  against how sexy you look right now.
 My knights are working so hard to support me.
 I need to do everything I can.
 Hey, Prickly Queen.
 You look like you must be  really cold in that dress.
 I don't want to hear that from a man who  wears nothing but underwear and a robe!
 This isn't underwear!  These are my dress clothes!
 I know Yami is like this, so I'm embarrassed  that I ever expected anything more!
 I had heard how dense he was,  but this is really bad.
 We need to hold an emergency meeting.
 I'm sorry that I'm such a  spineless captain, Puli.
 No, no! We've only just begun!
 Captain Charlotte!
 You've got this!
 When did you...
 Looks like the Black Bulls' captain  prefers the prim and proper type.
 We'll fix you up in no time.
 N-No! What I'm wearing now is fine.
 It's not! You need to be more aggressive  in making yourself appealing!
 A-Appealing?
 First, you're going to show him you can be  considerate by getting some food for him!
 When a huge plate of food arrives,
 immediately get some for him and serve him.
 That's the kind of kindness  that'll grab his heart!
 What's important here is your desire  to do something for the one you love.
 I-I see...
 Next, a good listener is always attractive.
 Isn't it great to have someone  listen to you talk about yourself?
 That's why you let them keep  talking until they're satisfied.
 Your responses can be whatever, really.
 ""Oh, really? I had no idea! Wow!""
 Is that how this works? I had no idea.
 And this is the most important thing!  The most important technique!
 T-Tell me!
 It's to nonchalantly touch him.
 T...Touch... him?
 Nope, nope, nope, nope! Absolutely not!
 Listen to me, Captain.
 Serving his food and listening to him  is just 10% of how to get a man.
 The other 90% relies on touching them.
 That's a lot relying on touch!
 It's no use... There's no way I could...
 You can do this, Captain!
 Are you going to let your rival beat you?!
 I...
 The Blue Rose Knights are with you, Captain.
 Thank you so much, everyone.
 I hear you loud and clear.
 I'm going to touch Yami!
 Master Finral, you're so cool and apathetic.
 You're just like the Magic Knight Fiorel from the novel I'm reading.
 He's the ultimate Magic  Knight who can use light,
 dark, flame, wind, water,  and earth magic, and...
 That's way too many attributes!
 What kind of novel is that?!
 So, um... Are you a strong fighter, Luck?
 I can show you personally.
 O-Oh, my. Isn't he being a bit forward?
 Wow, the Heart Kingdom  sounds really beautiful.
 I'd love to go see it.
 Sure! I'll take you there once  everything's taken care of.
 We'll even take your siblings!
 I seriously can't let my  guard down around that girl!
 I really need to just fire her now.
 Noelle?
 I-I really only have friends  in the Black Bulls,
 so it'd make me really happy if we could  get to know each other, Miss Puli.
 Oh, I really love to make dolls,
 so I hope you don't mind if  I make one of you, too.
 Wow, I'd be honored! I guess I should  give you my measurements, then!
 U-Um, I—
 I've got Coach Charmy on my side!  Like hell I'm going to lose!
 Suddenly touching Yami  is far too difficult for me.
 F-First, I should try to get him some food.
 Here. Eat up.
 Oh, thank you.
 I was supposed to get him some food,  but he beat me to the punch!
 You sure did take your sweet  time powdering your nose.
 Bet you're starving now  that you've let it all out.
 That's not what happened! I was talking  with my squad members, and it took a while!
 Ah... Yeah, I've been seeing your  squad members everywhere around here.
 You knew? Wait, of course you knew.
 I'm sure they tagged along  because they were worried...
 Because you sure can't hold your liquor.
 That's not— er, I guess  you're not totally wrong...
 Even when they're not on missions,  my squad members try to support me.
 They're also the ones who planned  this dinner party tonight.
 I only ever think about fighting  and forget about everything else...
 So I end up relying on them.
 Wait, I'm supposed to listen,  not keep blabbering on!
 That's fine. As long as you're  figuring out how to rely on others.
 Well, look at me. Whenever I shi—
 I mean, powder my nose, I get my  minion to use his spatial magic.
 Y-You should do that on your own!
 You know, that meat there... It's great  with a bit of pepper sprinkled on it.
 Oh?
 Our hands just nonchalantly touched...
 Yami's hand j-just...
 Captain?!
 Sis?!
 Did you really have to act like you  got touched by the biggest germ ever?
 That hurts, man.
 I don't think that's what just happened here.
 I want you to know how amazing  Fiorel is, Master Finral!
 Why don't we have a reading party?  In my room, you know, alone together.
 No, that's okay. I'm not  interested in that kind of thing.
 Why, of all times, did a girl who might  actually like me show up at this mixer?!
 Don't you dare touch her, Finral!
 Once you touch her, you're finished!  You're going to end up sweet-talking her!
 Resist, Finral! Resist! Resist!
 Aw, I'm jealous. Looks like Finral's  already fighting something.
 We should fight, too!  Like, right here and now!
 Right here and now?!
 D-Do I look like such a floozy to you?
 Resist, resist, resist, resist, resist, resist,
 resist, resist, resist, resist, resist, resist,
 resist, Finral!
 Finral seems to be in a lot of pain.
 Captain Charlotte?!
 A beautiful lady's in trouble!
 Ah, Captain Charlotte.  You're more beautiful than ev—
 I know I just saved you,
 but I didn't have a single  ulterior motive in mind!
 Because my heart already  belongs to someone else!
 Finral!
 What?!
 Looks like everybody's having fun down here.
 How long do you plan on holding me?
 I knew it. My ideal gentleman  just doesn't exist in real life.
 After dealing with how aggressive  you are, I realized something.
 I was ready to marry anyone,  but I was clearly rushing into things.
 Goodbye.
 Sheesh... I came to check on  him since he said he'd figured out
 how to train to get over his curse,
 but it was apparently all a farce.  I'm sorry for wasting your time, Miss Finnes.
 No, thank you for bringing me here, Langris.
 It appears Finral does fancy the ladies,
 but I believe that's just  another part of his kindness.
 That's not true. He's just a  good-for-nothing, girl-crazy loser.
 Let's head home.
 So you two were here, too, huh?
 Wh-What a coincidence...
 A coincidence.
 Yeah, of course it's a coincidence.
 You should be a little more honest with him.
 Asta is insanely dense.
 H-Huh? Wha?! Th-There's nothing  that I want to say to Stupidsta!
 I'm sorry, Asta. After I dragged  you here to help me with my training,
 I just keep striking out.
 I'll never be able to face Miss Finnes like this.
 That's not true, Finral!
 Your training's just begun!
 Asta...
 Man, that sure was a piece of work.
 So what do you think about guys  like Finral, Prickly Queen?
 No man could possibly move my heart.
 Because someone has already claimed it.
 Yeah, I know.
 Huh?!
 You always did say that  your work was your partner.
 Hngh...
 You okay there?
 It looks like you still need the angel's help.
 H-He's so close!
 Well, let's both do our  best these next six months.
 Yes.
 Asta just keeps getting braver,  and I seem to have more rivals,
 but I'm not going to give up just yet!
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 136: ""A Black Deep-Sea Story.""
 Page 136  A Black Deep-Sea Story
 Kahono? Wait, another rival?!

136,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 In order to defeat Megicula, the devil  who inhabits the Spade Kingdom,
 the Magic Knights have been training hard.
 Meanwhile, deep within the sea,
 another problem was arising.
 Kiato! Kahono! You two make a run for it.
 But...
 Go ask the Magic Knights for help.
 What? But we've gotten this far!
 Father!
 Dad!
 Let's fall back for now, Kahono!
 Okay.
 A Black Deep-Sea Story
 Raquey is hot all year round due to  the strong mana that surrounds it,
 making it a popular resort location.
 It's also an excellent training ground  for those who use water magic.
 If I can only maintain this force...
 It's not enough to just be able to split them.
 I need to make sure there's  more mana in both of them.
 A song? Or is that crying?
 I'm not sure why, but it  feels sort of... nostalgic.
 Wait, why did I just see my mother?
 Black Bulls, fight!
 Push harder!
 Harder! Even harder!
 Fight... Fight...
 I'll get you this time!
 You out of steam already?
 Well, I mean... It's not like  I usually run this much.
 And what's the point of  training like this, anyway?
 You know how much Mr. Yami and Asta  did in that battle with the elves.
 The stronger your body is,  the stronger your magic will be.
 That's right, Finral! If you get as buff as  Captain Yami, you'll be unstoppable!
 Isn't that hurdle a bit high?
 We should all get super buff, and then  you should all try to fight me!
 All right! We need to be  even louder this time!
 Whoa, there!
 Ow...
 Tch. Damn, I missed one.
 Zora, you bastard! What the hell was that for?!
 Well, I specialize in traps, so I'm  training with traps, you moron.
 Train together, my ass.
 I didn't join the squad so I could  be all buddy-buddy with you guys.
 What'd you say?!
 Luck, you bastard!  Are you trying to bury us?!
 Sure am!
 Here you go!
 Ugh. They're all so noisy.
 I-I can't hide my face while doing this pose!
 I-I'm so embarrassed!
 I've been eating so much of Charmy's  cooking that my weight's not going back down.
 Gonna lose weight, gonna lose weight,
 gonna lose weight, gonna lose weight...
 In order to bulk up, you need  to stress your muscles.
 It's said that it's effective when  weight training to do three sets,
 and it's important to monitor your  protein amounts and timing—
 Who knew that the deltoids and trapezius  were connected this way?
 I'm going to learn even more
 about human anatomy, and create  an even more accurate Marie doll.
 By the way, Gordon,
 I thought you mentioned that you  don't handle sunlight very well.
 Were you able to get over that?
 Yeah, I'm fine now.
 It's all thanks to this sunblock.
 You can try some if you'd like.
 Ah, thank you.
 You need to be meticulous  when dealing with UV rays.
 Here you go.
 That's cold! What the hell  do you think you're doing?!
 Huh?! Uh... What?!
 Hey... Here... you... go.
 Drinking first thing in  the morning's not so bad.
 Here you go.
 So aren't you gonna train  like the rest of them?
 You're just gonna ignore me?
 Guys! Food's ready!
 Thanks for the meal!
 Man, that was great!
 It's that sound again.
 Noelle?
 I think I heard it for the first  time somewhere around here.
 Hey!
 Asta...
 Is something wrong?
 Do you hear that strange sound?
 Sound?
 Huh?
 Kahono!
 Kiato!
 What are you doing here?
 Kahono
 I could ask you the same thing,  but this is great.
 We were just about to go find you.
 Kiato
 The sea goddess is as beautiful as ever.
 Did something happen at the Underwater Temple?
 Oh, right. We wanted to ask you guys for help.
 Please come with us.
 Underwater Temple
 They were attacked by a monster?!
 It was probably a guardian of the sea.
 They've been around since time immemorial,  and are said to be the sea god's servants.
 But why would a creature like that attack  people from the Underwater Temple?
 Gifso
 Something has disturbed the  underwater mana these past few days.
 Some of the creatures around  here have become violent.
 I decided to dig into this a  little further, then I saw it...
 I couldn't see it clearly because  of the disturbance in the mana,
 but south of the Underwater Temple,  there is a place called the Void of No Return.
 That's where I saw the guardian  of the sea letting its rage
 overtake it, going berserk.
 I'm sure the disturbance in the mana  here is due to the guardian's rage.
 The shrine mages tried to  quell the guardian's rage
 with their song and dance, but...
 They all got hurt trying to defend us.
 Kahono...
 What I'd like to ask from you  is to protect Kiato and Kahono.
 Please get them to the Void of No Return safely.
 Why the hell are you asking us, though?
 We're pretty busy with our training, you know.
 You were just drinking booze, Yami!
 I beg of you!
 I ask this knowing how  powerful the Black Bulls are!
 You're among the few  Magic Knights who can reach this
 Underwater Temple safely  despite being land dwellers.
 Because of the sea goddess's protection.
 This may sound harsh,  but you got any proof that
 this song and dance can calm  down that guardian of yours?
 Well...
 We're not protecting this  kingdom as volunteers.
 I can't just loan out some of my squad  members when your resolve's that weak.
 So basically, you just need to  know there's a chance, right?
 Huh?
 Noelle?
 The disturbance in the mana that's  affecting this whole underwater area...
 Maybe a devil's behind this, too.
 It's the Magic Knights' job to protect people.
 I'll get those two there safely, no matter what.
 Noelle...
 Sea Goddess...
 We...
 We'll definitely quell the guardian's rage!
 We've sung and danced solely for the sea god!
 We'll make sure the guardian  hears our prayers, too!
 I guess I'll acknowledge your resolve.
 So, what's this chance you mentioned?
 I... have an idea.
 It's right over there, Noelle.
 The Void of No Return.
 Just as the name suggests,
 it's said that any creature that  wanders in there can never return.
 I thought the stories about  the guardian of the sea
 and the Void of No Return were  just fairy tales when I was a kid.
 H-How deep does that thing go?
 So, what's your plan?
 I'm going to make the Sea Dragon's Cradle  smaller and more powerful.
 That's going to limit who  I can take with me, though.
 Which means other than you, Kahono, and Kiato,
 we need one more—
 Me, me! Me, me, me, me, me!
 Me! I'll go!
 Let's hurry up and kill that guardian!
 I wonder how strong it is.  I can't wait to find out!
 Let's just finish off the stupid thing so  I can work ou... I mean, so I can go see Marie.
 How can you say something  like that right now?!
 Don't worry! Life is an endless cycle!
 To taste noms that have been  aged since time immemorial...
 Yeah, you guys aren't going.
 What?!
 Tch!
 And you're not going, either.
 What?!
 But why?! Is it because I can't swim?!
 Oh, right. No way in hell you're going, then.
 Crap!
 How stupid can you be?
 Finral.
 You go.
 Huh?
 If things get dangerous, get everyone back  here safe, even if it costs your life.
 Got it?
 Yes, sir!
 Oh, and Noelle.
 You decided to do this, so make sure  you see it all the way through.
 Yes, sir!
 Such violent mana!
 If I let my guard down for  even a second, we're finished.
 Look!
 What the heck are those guys?!
 I don't know. We've never  seen them before, either.
 Kahono!
 Leave it to me!
 Song Magic: Mother Lullaby!
 It could be that the  powerful mana in the area
 caused the fish here to turn into monsters.
 Is that even...
 There are so many of them!
 There's no end to them.
 We'll just have to keep going.
 Noelle!
 Leave this to us.
 Song Magic: Destructive Beat!
 Wait! Kahono! Kiato!
 Big Brother!
 Got it!
 Combo Spell: Sea God's Descent!
 There are too many of them!
 Noelle...
 What am I even doing? I'm supposed  to protect Kahono and Kiato,
 and yet I'm just watching  while they do all the fighting.
 Noelle, run!
 Wh-What are you talking about?
 If I leave, you're going to  be thrown into the ocean!
 Don't worry. I promise to take those  two and meet back with you safely.
 But how...
 Well, our captain did say to bring everyone  back even if it costs my life.
 And I'm not so much of a failure  that I'd leave a girl behind
 in such a dangerous place.
 So go on! Quickly!
 Finral...
 Noelle!
 Kahono!
 Everyone...
 I can't just...
 That's right. If I let this stop me,
 I'll never be able to defeat  the devil and avenge my mother!
 The Spirit Guardians borrow some power  from natural mana to use powerful magic,
 but they still cannot defeat devils.
 Natural mana...
 If I can somehow get all this chaotic  underwater mana on my side...
 Please... lend me your strength!
 What?
 This is...
 Huh?
 It's so powerful!
 It requires so much magic control  just to protect all of us, let alone this...
 This is amazing! I always knew  you were amazing, Noelle!
 Sorry for putting you in danger like that.
 Now, we're heading right to  the guardian of the sea!
 Wh-What's that?
 That's a kraken!
 The kraken is the protector of the sea.  It protects all the creatures within the sea.
 So right now, it's protecting the guardian?
 Ooh, a squid leg!
 Not bad, Finral!
 Here it comes!
 This ink isn't just to obstruct our vision.
 It's disturbing the mana  around us. At this rate...
 Water Creation Magic:
 Valkyrie Armor!
 Noelle!
 Sorry, but I need you to take a little nap.
 Now's our chance!
 Right!
 Ruins?
 I had no idea there was a place like  this at the bottom of that hole.
 I wonder if people used to live down here, too.
 Is that... the guardian?
 Such powerful mana...
 It's as though it's just unleashing pure rage.
 Are we being threatened?
 I see. The guardian was  uneasy because of its baby.
 And the creatures of the sea were
 just trying to protect the  guardian and its baby.
 This is...
 So that sound I've been  hearing was your lullaby.
 Wait! Was that...
 Thank you, Sea Godde—
 A-Are you hurt?
 Huh?
 No, I'm fine. It's nothing.
 Maybe my mother came here once, too.
 Though I'm sure I took much  longer and was far clumsier.
 Even so, I made it here.
 I'm growing, too.
 Thank you all so much!
 But are you sure this is  all the thanks you need?
 Gramps was super excited about holding a feast.
 This is the best, la!
 F-Feast?
 Kahono, Kiato! Tell Gramps hi for me.
 Sure!
 Come visit again once  things have calmed down.
 Then I'll give the sea goddess  the best welcome ev—
 Let's go on another double  date, Asta and Noelle!
 Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha...
 Sure thing!
 H-H-H-How could you agree to that?!
 Kahono's so forward. I love it!
 Damn it, no! I have Miss Finnes!
 Good work.
 Yami...
 Come to think of it, it was also here  that a good-for-nothing like you
 decided to willingly join a  battle for the first time.
 Yeah, I guess that also happened.
 Do you remember what I told you when  you were still a good-for-nothing?
 You've probably got your own  way of fighting, right?
 Yes. And I've already found it.
 Now, I'm working hard toward my  next goal... or at least, I'm trying.
 I see.
 That's great and all, but...
 Yes?
 You totally brought a squid leg over here  with your spatial magic, didn't you?!
 I-It was a spur-of-the-moment thing! I'm sorry!
 I don't want to hear your lame excuses.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
 Welcome... back... everyone!
 Thanks, Henry!
 Right. Guess it's chow time.
 I'm starving!
 What are you making for us?
 We'll start simple with a seafood barbecue
 and enjoy its natural yumminess!
 Plenty of protein!
 A gift for Marie!
 I want to eat squid.
 A squid almost finished... I mean,  I'm done with squid for now.
 Just watch, Mother.
 I'm going to become even stronger.
 Noelle! Asta! Let's continue to do our best!
 I'm going to become an idol! Just you watch!
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 137:

137,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 The Black Bulls visited  Raquey to do some training.
 Asta and Noelle reunited with  Kahono and Kiato there,
 but under the sea, trouble was brewing.
 An underwater creature they called  the guardian was wreaking havoc,
 causing trouble even for the Underwater Temple.
 In order to quell the guardian, Noelle and  a few others headed into the water.
 Just watch, Mother.
 I'm going to become even stronger.
 But it wasn't only Noelle who  vowed to become stronger.
 So this is...
 The food that's going to explosively  enhance our mana just by eating it.
 You can do that just by eating food?
 I guess I'll dig in.
 You don't have any magic, so it's not like  anything's going to change for you.
 Who knows?! I might get more anti-magic!
 Let's eat!
 Holy crap! I can feel it instantly!
 It feels like my mana's  overflowing from within me.
 The hell is this?!
 My body's just...
 This is so much fun!
 You guys!
 What's going—huh?!
 She's in trouble, too?!
 M-Miz Charmy! You need to  do something about this!
 No... This food isn't good enough.
 No, wait! Stop!
 I know! I'll have to go see him!
 Charmy's Century of Hunger,  Gordon's Millennium of Loneliness
 Magic Knights Headquarters
 Jamo
 You want to be my student?
 Her fiery, glistening eyes...
 Her fiery, glistening drool...
 And...
 Her fiery, glistening forehead!
 As always...
 She's really something else!
 All right, you got it! You're my  student starting today, shrimp!
 Thanks!
 Food that'll enhance mana, eh?
 I can make food that will  recover mana with my magic.
 But what I need right now is food that  will explosively enhance my friends' mana!
 I see. That's not gonna be a simple task.
 Are you ready for this, shrimp?
 Sure am!
 La!
 La!
 La!
 La!
 986, 987, 988, 989, 990...
 The sheep cooks are your magic.
 But just leveling up your  magic won't be enough.
 991, 992...
 993, 994, 995...
 You need to seal away your magic and  train yourself past your physical limits,
 so that not only the Sheep Cooks  but also you, shrimp,
 996, 997, 998...
 can acquire the food that will enhance mana.
 999... 1,000!
 We've got your stamina up now.
 According to this book, the next  thing you need to do is acquire three
 unknown ingredients that  even I've never seen before.
 Three unknown ingredients?
 The first is the bulb of a  mentanpin mandoradora!
 Got it!
 The second is the noonesheardofthis coelacanth!
 The third is the butt hide  of a surprisesquatch!
 La!
 Say what?!
 The shrimp did what?!
 La... La... La...
 You didn't have to push yourself that hard!
 Just as you said, Master.
 Now... I...
 Tonight I, Charmy Pappitson, will serve
 the best mana enhancement dishes ever.
 So these are true mana enhancement dishes?
 Uh, why did I get called in all of a sudden?
 You're insurance if things go south, duh.
 Wait, when what goes south?!
 Miz Charmy... You pushed yourself so hard.
 Eat up!
 I-I'm gonna pass.
 I think I will, too.
 We should get going.
 Please eat it!
 Please show Miz Charmy  her efforts weren't in vain!
 I beg of you!
 These dishes were created by the shri...
 by Charmy for her friends, and she  risked her life for these ingredients!
 Who the heck are you?
 Master... Asta...
 Oh, fine.
 C-Could it be...
 Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going on?!
 This isn't good. Everyone!
 Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!
 Ow...
 The hell are you guys doing?
 Captain Yami?
 You thinking about using  my wheels to go somewhere?
 Now's not the time for that, Yami!
 The hell is that?
 That's... demon food!
 Demon food?!
 You just now thought that up, didn't you?
 Quit making random shit up, you jerk!
 Who the hell is that?
 This is the first time I'm  seeing it with my own eyes,
 but the combination of pure devotion and mana
 sometimes gives life to food.
 Uh, that doesn't happen!
 Then how would you explain  what we're seeing right now?!
 All the feelings that Charmy put toward  enhancing mana were the real deal!
 And that's exactly how the food ended  up with an explosive amount of mana!
 The food has life now?
 Huh?
 Miz Charmy, what's wrong?!
 The hell?!
 Magna?
 I dunno why, but I don't have any strength.
 Luck?!
 It's stealing away our mana!
 What's going on?
 The demon food is absorbing all of our mana
 so it can become even more powerful!
 No, really. Who are you?
 The noms I made...
 Hey, kid. What the hell are you zoning out for?
 Don't you think your sword  can do something about that
 stupidly big food monster?
 Well...
 Tch. Okay, fine.
 I'll go out on a limb and—
 You can't!
 What do you mean?
 That food is filled with  Miz Charmy's feelings...
 Yes! It's food!
 The hell are you talking about?
 Asta...
 Please put a stop to it!
 Okay!
 Wait, are you seriously...
 I'll gobble up all of Miz Charmy's food!
 Don't blame me if you get a stomachache.
 Our mana's gradually coming back.
 Mana's flowing out of the  part the kid's eating?
 I'm not gonna let Asta have all the noms!
 We can't just leave this to those two!
 I guess not.
 Well, now that that's settled,  this shouldn't take too long.
 Eat every last bit of that  stupidly big food monster.
 Wait! Me, too?
 Absolutely not!
 Again...
 Who are you?
 Good job, you guys.
 This looks like a scene right out of hell.
 Miz Charmy...
 La?
 I feel like that food was  different from your usual food.
 Huh?
 I can't really put it into words,
 but it seems like it was  solely made to enhance mana.
 Your food is usually filled with your desire  to make the people eating it happy,
 but that seemed to be missing...
 Wait! I'm sorry for being out of line!
 Master!
 We might've forgotten the most  important thing as chefs.
 Charmy... no, shrimp! Back to square one!
 Yes, Master!
 One more time!
 One more time!
 My days now are spent  surrounded by many friends.
 I might be happier now than I've ever been.
 We have to win in this fight against the devil.
 If we don't, our happy days will come to an end.
 I think that last one was pretty good.
 Asta...
 Do you think I could join in on your training?
 Of course!
 Noelle, go ahead and take a break!
 Uh, sure.
 Come at me with everything you've got!
 O-Okay...
 With everything I've got...
 That wasn't my intention,  but I'm sure Asta will be okay.
 Okay, here I go.
 Poison Curse Magic:  Dwelling of the Poison Cloud.
 Gordon! Are you okay?!
 As expected.
 I'm no match for you.
 I was fighting with everything I had.
 Maybe I've gotten weaker.
 When I first came to the  Black Bulls, I was truly alone.
 But I was sharp as a knife and had the  strength to not let anyone near me.
 And yet, now I'm...
 Please don't try to find me.
 I can't just stay complacent,  surrounded by my friends.
 In order to defeat the devil, and to  regain my strength from before...
 I must be alone once more.
 The Forest of Poisonous Magical Beasts
 In the past, Lady Mereoleona walked  through a strong magic region alone
 and became as powerful as she is now.
 That's why I'm going to go through the  Forest of Poisonous Magical Beasts
 that lies right before the Witches' Forest.
 Noble Realm
 Common Realm
 I'd go to the strong magic region... but that's a bit scary,
 Forsaken Realm
 Strong Magic Region
 so I'll do my best in this forest.
 Common Realm
 Forsaken Realm
 Things seem to be going well.
 Probably because I'm all alone again.
 Okay, I'll take a break now.
 I am pretty hungry.
 Huh?
 My week's worth of food!
 Wait!
 3 Days Later
 I can't find my backpack.  Maybe I'll head back...
 I think I've gotten a good  taste of being alone again.
 Huh?
 I don't know how to get home.
 Eating all alone never tastes good.
 Eating with everyone was pretty rowdy, but fun.
 If my friends were here at a time like this...
 Gordon! I'll go get you some yummy food, stat!
 Get a grip, Gordon. As your partner  in the G-G duo, I'll be by your side.
 Gordon, are you tired? Eek!
 I know you've got more to you than that!
 I'm done trying to kill Magna,  so you're next, Gordon!
 What the hell am I doing?
 Now's my chance to test out the strength
 I've regained by being alone.
 Poison Curse Magic:  Dwelling of the Poison Cloud.
 One more time!
 But why?
 My poison curse magic didn't work.
 I really must be weaker.
 Thank goodness... This is the  first water I've had in three days.
 I'll live here on my own for a while.
 I'll find food on my own and sleep alone.
 And wash my face alone, like this...
 Back at the Black Bulls' hideout, Asta and  I would always wash each other's backs.
 There were nights I'd drink with  Vanessa as we talked about our dreams.
 There were times I helped Gauche  take care of his Marie doll.
 There were even times Luck and I  risked our lives fighting each other.
 I must get stronger.
 But to think that being alone is so painful...
 Even though this was normal for  me before joining the Black Bulls...
 I wonder what everyone's up to right now.
 This is...
 We've got to hurry!
 All right, let's get moving!
 Right!
 They're going to come find me, right?
 You guys are here already?
 The... mother of that  magical beast from earlier?
 This is...
 We've got to hurry!
 All right, let's get moving!
 Right!
 Poison Curse Magic: Aufwachen Dachs!
 It's no use... My magic is having no effect at all.
 I'm finished... I'm going to die here all alone.
 I see...
 So they didn't abandon me.
 I finally see that it wasn't  loneliness that I needed.
 I became stronger because I had friends!
 This loneliness is poison itself.
 And the antidote for this poison...
 is my friendship with my teammates!
 I'm sorry...
 I panicked, and I ended up hurting you.
 That's unforgivable for a Magic Knight who's  tasked with protecting this kingdom...
 You're my fellow comrades living in the Clover Kingdom.
 No... You're my friends.
 Thanks for leading the way.
 I see. You both have immunity to poison magic.
 So that's why my magic didn't work.
 I'm home.
 Ah...
 Everyone must've gone looking for me.
 They might all be in danger somewhere.
 Now it's my turn to go find them.
 I'll never leave my friends again.
 This is great!
 Listen up! Surpass your limits!  Eat and drink all you can!
 I've definitely surpassed them!
 Mister Yami, the workers  here sure are staring at us.
 Hell if I care!
 They're doing an inventory count and  selling off all their ingredients,
 and this says...
 we get 90% off our bill for  an unlimited time period!
 I'm not going to lose!
 No matter how much food there is,
 I'm going to eat all of it!
 In the name of my tummy!

 Tolsa Village
 Those flowers are for me?
 Yes. You like them, don't you?
 Aren't you supposed to be selling them, though?
 It's fine. You're my hero, Zara.
 Dad.
 Zora! Come here a sec!
 Well, I'll be going now.
 What was that about?
 Don't these smell great, Zora?  I love this scent.
 Yeah, I know.
 In Zara's Footsteps
 What a pain. Like I have time for that.
 Train together, my ass.
 I didn't join the squad so I could  be all buddy-buddy with you guys.
 I left on a journey to train  since I didn't have time
 to bother with the rest of the Black Bulls,
 but how long am I going to keep doing this?
 Right, Dad?
 Could it have been someone from  the village? Yeah, no way.
 It's true that Dad was called the pride of
 Tolsa Village because he was  the first peasant Magic Knight.
 But that's all in the past.
 Damn it!
 He's not even using a grimoire?
 Guess he has potential.  Well, do your best, I gues—
 Who's there?!
 Whoops, my bad.
 Wow! You hit the target all the way from here!
 Your flame magic is amazing, Kaito!
 I can't wait for you to take  the Magic Knights Entrance Exam!
 Oh, stop. This isn't the time for that.
 I'm guessing that brat's some rich kid who came to a summer resort for some R&R.
 What's that look for?
 Apologize!
 Did you just tell Kaito to apologize?!
 Watch your tongue!
 Oh, stop. He's just a child who doesn't even  have a grimoire yet, and a peasant at that.
 Here you go.
 That should settle things, right?
 Let's go.
 I'm sorry I'm a peasant.
 What?
 But when I turn fifteen and get my grimoire...
 I hope you're not about to say you're  going to join the Magic Knights.
 I am! I'm joining the Magic Knights!
 Don't bother. It's impossible for peasants.
 But there are peasants in the Magic Knights!
 Are there?
 They've made quite the buzz lately.
 I'm sure they only got in because they had  dirt on a current Magic Knight or something.
 I know for a fact that Zara  Ideale didn't join that way!
 Zara Ideale?
 I've never heard of him.
 What squad?
 The Purple Orcas!
 The Purple Orcas?
 The squad at the center of  all the unsavory rumors after
 their captain got replaced  because of a scandal?
 Zara's an amazing Magic Knight!
 Yeah?
 How? If he's that amazing,  he must be renowned for something.
 Well? Isn't he?
 H-He died during a mission.
 See? This is exactly my point.
 Peasants should know their place and  just stay in their villages until they die.
 Shut up!
 What's that magic?
 Teach him a lesson.
 Okay.
 You stupid peasant!
 Apologize to Kaito!
 No!
 Apologize!
 I didn't do anything wrong!
 I see...
 That's enough.
 Wh-Who are you?
 That reeks!
 Hold it!
 That power...
 Y-You'll regret this, you peasant!
 Are you stupid?
 Don't pick fights when you're  up against three guys like that.
 You don't even have a grimoire.  There's no way you would've won.
 Try using that tiny little brain of yours.
 Though... what you said about Zara Ideale  being an amazing Magic Knight
 isn't exactly wrong.
 Ina? Is that you?
 Dad!
 Ina, what happened to you? Don't tell me...
 This masked guy... saved me.
 What? I-I'm sorry for any  trouble my son caused you.
 Ina, what happened? Tell me.
 Did you do something you can't tell me about?
 Peasants should know their place and  just stay in their villages until they die.
 Why was I born to peasants?
 If I wasn't born into a peasant family,  I would've had greater magic powers.
 If only you weren't my father!
 Hey!
 Wait!
 He's exactly right.
 What?
 If I weren't in this state, he wouldn't  have to help me with my work.
 I could've given him more  time to train with magic.
 I'm a failure as a father.
 L-Let go of me!
 Wh-Where are you going?
 Wait, have I seen that  young man somewhere before?
 What the hell are you doing?!
 Cool Mask Guy.
 Huh?
 That's what you'll call me.
 What the hell are you talking about?
 Listen up, you shitty little shrimp...
 No, you snot-nosed shrimp.
 Who're you calling a snot-nosed shrimp?!
 You probably know this,  but I'll remind you anyway.
 The amazing Magic Knight you were  just praising was also a peasant.
 So what if he was?
 Are you trying to say he's  way different than me?
 It's true that Zara Ideale never  lamented his upbringing,
 and never said anything bad about anyone.
 You knew Zara, Mask Guy?!
 That's Cool Mask Guy to you.
 But as you said, he's way different than you.
 I know... that I'm aiming too high.
 I'm aiming too high?
 Yeah. You're a peasant, yet you  want to join the Magic Knights.
 I don't remember how many times I've failed  the Magic Knights Entrance Exam, Zora.
 But I don't believe I'm aiming too high, either.
 I'm always telling you that I'm gonna  join the Magic Knights, aren't I?
 That's because I really believe I can!
 You said you were gonna join  the Magic Knights, didn't you?
 So you heard me. You got a problem with that?
 I never said I did.
 But if you're able to say that, doesn't that  mean you really believe you can do it?
 That's not what you'd call aiming too high.
 Zara Ideale said the same thing.
 I really believe I can do it?
 Let me give you some advice, snot-nosed shrimp.
 Stop calling me a snot-nosed shrimp!
 Wait, what's that?
 Isn't that doll... you?
 This is the envoy of justice,  the Super Magic Knight Zora.
 I'm twelve years old, you know...
 He has a mouth on him,  but he's as good as his word.
 He's a warrior who protects  the country behind the scenes.
 What the hell kind of backstory is that?
 You look like that, but you're  into dolls? Really?
 Zora was also the child of a peasant,  but he didn't idolize nobles or royalty.
 That's because he could do something  nobles and royalty couldn't.
 Stop ignoring me! Wait, something  nobles and royalty couldn't do?
 Now, I wonder what that could be?
 How the hell would I know?
 I'm sure you wouldn't.
 But if you don't know that,  you'll never be able to join
 the Magic Knights.
 Zora was also the child of a peasant,  but he didn't idolize nobles or royalty.
 That's because he could do something  nobles and royalty couldn't.
 Now, I wonder what that could be?
 Ina, let's take a lunch break.
 I'll take care of the afternoon work.
 You can go practice your magic if you want.
 You got lucky yesterday,
 but you'll pay for embarrassing me.
 I've come to collect.
 Do you know what this is, peasant?
 A magic item?
 Now that I have this...
 Whoa, now... A kid shouldn't  be playing with that.
 Apologize. That's not too difficult, is it?
 You just need to grovel right there.
 I didn't do anything wrong!
 What did you just say?
 You're not going to get off with just  a few scratches. Hurry up and—
 You dumbass!
 That's the second time. Stick to  your usual toys, you brat.
 You're really strong, huh?
 You're not a Magic Knight... are you?
 Who knows?
 Ina...
 So you must be the little thief.
 May I help you?
 What do you think you're doing to my son?!
 See for yourself.
 That's... a magic item!
 Your son stole it from my villa.
 I-I did not!
 What are you talking about?  You clearly had the magic item.
 Your son took it! I just picked  it up after he dropped it!
 Is that true, Kaito?
 Don't let him fool you.  You can never trust a peasant.
 You taught me that yourself, Father.
 That I did. You're coming with me!
 I'm taking you to the royal capital  so they can arrest you
 as the burglar that you are!
 Ina!
 Let go of me! I'm not a thief!
 Let go of my son!
 And what if I refuse?
 I believe my son!
 I won't let you take him!
 Dad...
 You filthy peasant...  You'll pay for your insolence!
 Dad!
 What?!
 Dad! The flowers!
 Don't worry.
 You wouldn't have to get hurt  if you just knew your place.
 That magic...
 You'll be wiping off that smug look soon enough!
 I have proof that your son is a thief!
 I'll just ask the Magic Knights to deal with it!
 Then let's see this so-called proof.
 Wh-Who are you?
 That robe...
 You're a Black Bull!
 So he really is...
 Perfect timing! I need you to  capture these thieves for me!
 And I'm telling you to show me proof.
 O-Of course!
 You saw him take it from the villa, didn't you?
 U-Um...
 I just happened to be present  when your precious little boy
 used a magic item to mess  with the snot-nosed shrimp here.
 After I interceded, I saw him  drop it and run off like a coward.
 I'm guessing your dad found  out the magic item was missing,
 so you tried to place the blame  on the snot-nosed shrimp.
 You're the only thief here.
 They say lying is the first  step to becoming a thief,
 but I guess it was the other way around for you.
 You're just the stupid son  of a worthless noble.
 Is this true, Kaito?
 Here's your proof.
 Wh-What happened?!
 You took it, didn't you?
 Y-Yes! I'm really sorry!
 W-Wait, Kaito!
 I'll let you off the hook today!
 Let them off the hook, my ass!
 They say a child is the  reflection of his parents.
 Clearly, you two are the  dictionary definition of that.
 I've been sick of nobles for a long time,  but you have no right to raise a child!
 You're a worthless noble  and a failure as a father.
 This item is too good for you.
 Get moving, or I'll kill you.
 Yes, sir!
 They even run away the same way.
 Dad...
 I never knew you could use such powerful magic.
 I've failed the Magic Knights  Entrance Exam numerous times.
 It's embarrassing to say, but this  injury came from one of those failures.
 But still, I can't give up.
 Even while I do my usual work,  I constantly train with my magic.
 Because I want to be like my hero.
 He also failed numerous times,  but ultimately, he joined the Magic Knights.
 I'm sure he worked really hard for it.
 Zora was also the child of a peasant,  but he didn't idolize nobles or royalty.
 That's because he could do something  nobles and royalty couldn't.
 Now, I wonder what that could be?
 I figured it out, Cool Mask Guy.
 Cool Mask Guy?
 The thing Zora was able to do.
 Then you should know what you  need to say to your dad, too.
 I'm sorry, Dad... for what I said to you.
 Ina...
 I'm sure you'll be able to join  the Magic Knights someday!
 I won't be joining alone.
 Huh?
 Let's both do our best together, Ina!
 Yeah!
 By the way...
 Why did you even bother with me?
 No particular reason.
 I see.
 I guess you really are a Super Magic Knight.
 What?
 You're a Magic Knight.  You're wearing a robe, aren't you?
 I never got as far as  becoming a Super Magic Knight.
 Now, I'm just striving to  become a true Magic Knight.
 Just like you.
 Yeah! I'll join the Magic Knights someday!
 Well, do your best, snot-nosed shrimp.
 Yeah!
 A rainbow stinkbug!
 It reeks!
 I'm the one who'll become the Wizard King.
 Nope, it's me!
 They're only able to say that because  they truly believe they can.
 Just watch, Dad.
 I'll make it to this zero stage.
 Guess whipping the other Black Bulls  into shape would help with that.
 Those jerks are such a handful.

 Super Magic Knight Zora
 Super Magic Knight Zora!
 Boom! The envoy of justice,  the Super Magic Knight Zora!
 I'm twelve years old, you know...
 And now, I'm 25!
 I now have something more  suitable for my age!
 Newly sculpted, painted, and fully articulated!
 The envoy of justice, Super Magic Knight Zora!
 Hey.
 Gulp.
 So you really do like playing with dolls!
 W-Wait, I can explain...
 He has a mouth on him,  but he's as good as his word.
 This delusion of a warrior who  protects the land from the shadows...
 Did you really think that up at your age?
 No, that was my dad, Zara Ideale.
 Lying is the first step to becoming a thief!
 Zara's an amazing Magic Knight!
 He'd never think up something so dumb!
 I'm not lying!
 Well, that was totally out of character.
 I'm rather delicate, so I guess I got a  bit sentimental when I went back home.

 That's right. Now's not the time to  worry about how I get things done.
 There ain't no shops open this late.
 Have a seat.
 You're awake?
 I just wandered down here, and this  bottle invited me to have a drink.

 No, have as much as you'd like.

 Well, this is nice.
 I always wanted to enjoy a drink with you alone.

 But I'm going to have to ask for a rain check.
 Sure.
 I'd love to have one next time.
 Don't push yourself too hard.
 Right. I'll be back soon.
 A Witch's Homecoming
 Queen of Witches
 I'm here to ask a favor of you.
 I want you to tell me how I can  strengthen my friends and myself.
 We'll be fighting the Spade Kingdom soon.
 The Witches' Forest will be in danger, too.
 I am fully aware.
 Not only of your actions, but also of  the threat heading toward our forest.
 It is unfathomable that  I would not be aware of this.
 Then you understand, don't you?
 They possess mana far greater  than that of any normal mage.
 We're going to have to fight them.
 And my friends only know how to  fight by pushing themselves too far.
 It's a miracle that we haven't  lost anyone yet because of it.
 But this time...
 You already have the power to change fate.
 What do you fear?
 Rouge is not all-powerful.
 If I lose my mana, Rouge also  loses her power to change fate.
 Please... teach me some of the ancient magic
 that lies within the Witches' Forest,  which only you know of.
 I need your powers in order to fight them!
 Even if you could actually use my magic,
 I fail to see the point in this.
 Then just...
 Teach me the ancient magic  that lies in this forest.
 That doesn't change anything.
 You seem to be mistaken.
 You're right. I escaped this place,
 so I know I'm out of line  to even ask for your help.
 But...
 If I can't gain anything here,  my friends will...
 Well... I'm not saying there  isn't a way to give you power.
 But there is one condition...
 So you must be, um...
 Samantha Kravitz
 Elvira Aguirre
 I-I'm Samantha.
 It's nice to meet you, Miss Vanessa.
 So you're Samantha, and you're... Elvira.
 The Queen of Witches told me about you.
 I'm only doing this because  the Queen ordered me to.
 But you're not my superior, understand?
 Yes, I know that. So it'd be  great if you could lead the way.
 There it is.
 We have security golems  placed outside the forest
 to notify us if the  Spade Kingdom attacks, but...
 Security golems will react to any threat,
 but they can't tell humans  from magical beasts.
 They'd never stop otherwise,
 so the Queen has set them to stop shooting after three shots.
 In that case, when the  Spade Kingdom actually attacks,
 they won't be much help as an early defense.
 And you were told to make them useful, right?
 The Queen of Witches herself  gave you special treatment,
 so I'm sure that'd be an easy task for you.
 No, it's not that simple.
 U-Um...
 Yes?
 There are magical beasts staring at us.
 Shoot attack spells at them! Any ones you know!
 They should flee after one hit!
 I'm sorry...
 Hey, didn't you defeat the last  enemy that invaded this place?
 Or what? Are you useless without the  help of men from the outside world?
 Elvira, that's not very nice.
 So?
 Well, back then, we...
 Team Two!
 Don't you dare underestimate us witches!
 Y-You don't need to bring that up!
 I guess I never asked what kind of magic  you two possess. Could you show me?
 Sure...
 Sound magic.
 This is all I can do. I'm sorry.
 Thanks for showing me. And what about you?
 Magic that projects illusions?
 What else?
 That's it. You've got a problem with that?
 No. It's my fault for not  confirming your powers first.
 I'm sorry. I really can't do this job.
 I'm absolutely useless.  I'm just going to hold you back.
 You should just give up this job already.
 We're both failures, anyway.
 The way Samantha panics is just like Grey.
 And Elvira being so proud  reminds me of Noelle.
 What's really so different  between them and these girls?
 Let's wrap things up for today.
 You're free to go. I'll think  of something by tomorrow.
 I'm sorry.
 Not like anything's going to change.
 Those two won't be enough help!
 When the time for war comes, I will need everyone out there.
 So you want me to train them  until they'll be useful in battle?
 But who knows how long that'll take?
 I get it now. So that was your plan all along.
 Whatever are you talking about?
 You're trying to get me to give up by  giving me a task that's impossible to do!
 What do you use your magic for?
 Hey, did you hear?
 About how the Queen's making her  deal with those two failures, right?
 Yeah, that's not happening.  I mean, it's Samantha and Elvira!
 The Queen of Witches can be so mean.
 No matter how special Vanessa might be,  there are things even she can't pull off.
 I know, right?
 I can hear you.
 I guess the witches here never change.
 That cake shop ended up closing down.
 That's a shame.
 The witches in this forest love to talk.
 But I've never gotten to  join their conversations.
 That probably goes for those two, too.
 I'll cut you a deal! Act now,  and it'll only be 20,000 yuls!
 Are you buying?
 Why, thank you!
 Oh...
 Oh, hey. It's been a while. How've you been?
 Wait, Domina?!
 I see. So that's why you're back.
 Yes. What about you?
 Dominante Code
 Well, you know that hubby of  mine can't work a normal job.
 He's a wanted man, after all.
 He has nothing better to do,  so he's been farming,
 Fanzell Kruger
 Mariella
 but that's not enough to put food on the table.
 Which means I have to peddle these magic items.
 It's such a pain.
 I'm surprised you got permission.
 Yeah, considering I escaped  this place, just like you did.
 I'm guessing the Queen thinks  it might benefit her, too.
 You are a pretty good magic item saleswoman.
 Yeah, but sounds like you're having a hard time.
 That's for sure. I'm at a loss right now.
 Then I have the perfect magic item for you!
 It's a magic washboard that gets any  stain out, depending on the user's mana.
 We're friends, so I'll cut  the price down to 8,000 yuls!
 How am I supposed to use  this against magical beasts?
 I dunno.
 You're not gonna buy it?
 Look...
 Why would I buy something that I'm  not even sure will be of any use?
 Aw, it's always about how you use things.
 The Queen of Witches manages to  keep all the witches here in line.
 It's just like that!
 Hm? Something wrong?
 No.
 What do you use your magic for?
 All right. The three of us are going to get
 those magical beasts away from the forest.
 I'm sorry... I can't do it.
 This is just a waste of time.
 Don't worry. We can do this.
 No, we're the only ones who can.
 You seem pretty confident for  some reason. Why is that?
 I am. Look at this.
 This is the Witches' Forest.  This is the magical beasts' territory.
 Smaller magical beasts gather  around here to eat nuts.
 And bigger magical beasts  feed on those smaller ones.
 And right here...
 There are a lot of trees  that are loaded with nuts,
 so a lot of small magical beasts gather.
 I saw a number of bigger magical beasts, too.
 You saw them?
 I stayed up all night investigating.
 You finally looked at me.
 S-So?
 The rest is simple.
 We'll lead the larger magical beasts that  come near the Witches' Forest this way.
 Then they won't come here anymore.
 How is that simple?
 Do you really think we can do that?
 That's impossible.
 We can. It's not impossible.
 I was just like you two. I'd given up.
 But...
 What are you doing?
 Dollies?
 They're so little.
 Think back... to the first time  you were able to use magic.
 Everyone's thought about what they  wanted to use their magic for.
 As for me...
 I wanted to make everyone smile.
 That was the one thing I couldn't give up on.
 Even now, I don't want to see anyone cry.
 Wouldn't it be even more wonderful  if the dolls had color?
 Yeah!
 O-Oh, fine.
 Wow!
 And believe it or not, these dolls talk, too!
 Really?!
 Huh?!
 Listen to this. I got hit on  in town again yesterday.
 Really?
 But the only ones who ever talk to  you are old guys and little kids.
 Any type of magic can be used for all kinds of things, depending on
 how you use and combine it.
 The thing that made those kids smile  was none other than our magic.
 Are you ready?
 Here we go.
 Good, you two. Just like that.
 Elvira!
 I know!
 We've been running a while...  Are we there yet?
 The markers I left last night...
 Okay!
 Just a little more!
 Okay!
 This is it.
 Wh-What are you doing?!
 No! Those are actual little magical beasts!
 But we came this far...
 What should we do? Run?
 Don't give up!
 Elvira! I need you to make this  as terrifying as possible!
 What do you mean?!
 Samantha! Make it roar!  Make it sound really, really strong!
 O-Okay!
 Our plan worked.
 We actually...
 ...did it.
 Yes, we did.
 That's amazing!
 We can't do anything like that.
 Huh?
 But why...
 The Queen showed us.
 I guess we can do it...
 It's all thanks to you.
 You two found something you  didn't want to give up on.
 Make sure you never forget what that is.
 Yes.
 All of my dummies are absolutely  terrible at giving up.
 Well, then...
 I came here to learn some powerful spell,
 but never mind.
 Why is that?
 I'm going to train myself  and gradually raise my mana.
 I'll continue thinking about  the best way to use my magic.
 I won't give up.
 That's all I can do, and that's fine.
 So you were able to tug the  threads of people's emotions?
 Yes... Those threads were always connected.
 I'm going to continue to  use my magic so that all my
 friends in the Black Bulls  can always keep smiling.
 As you said, I was mistaken.
 It wasn't Rouge's magic that could change fate.
 Ever since the day I left this forest...
 Choose for yourself.
 He gave me the opportunity, but he's  not the one who changed my fate.
 I'm the one who chose my path,  and I'm the one who changed my fate.
 I'm going to continue to change  the worst fate that may befall us.
 I'm going to pull together the  threads that will connect to the fate
 that keeps everyone smiling.
 Then go. You have no reason to stay here.
 Thank you, Queen.
 Oh, you going home already?
 Yes. I wanted to thank you, too.
 ""Too""?
 Well, whatever.
 If you want to thank me, buy this.
 This is a magic item that  you put in the bath, and then
 bubbles flow out of these holes.
 It's great for relaxation.
 Right now, it's on sale for the  special low price of 12,000 yuls!
 I'm not buying it.
 What?!
 I'm sure you've earned plenty  without me having to buy that.
 Well, yeah. It's great that  I can run my business here.
 It's all thanks to the Queen of Witches.
 Despite what she says, she still looks after us.
 Yeah...
 Tell Fanzell and Mariella hi for me.
 Tell Asta and the others hi for me, too.
 Hey.
 Have a seat.
 You're awake?
 I woke up.
 So, you learn any new spells?
 No, not a single one.
 But that's fine.
 I see.
 There seems to be a lot left,  considering your usual pace.
 You said you wanted to have a drink  with me, so I saved some for ya.
 Thank you.
 But... I'll have to take a rain check again.
 Why?
 I'm going to lay off for a while  so I can train properly.
 I see.
 Okay, I'm heading to bed.
 Oh, yeah.
 What is it?
 Welcome back.
 I'm home!
 Thank you, Queen of Witches.
 Thanks to you, I know what path I need to take.
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 140:  ""A Favor for Julius.""

140,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 Lord Julius...
 I told you that you're not allowed  to go wandering off for a while.
 I'm surprised you knew I'd come through here.
 Do you realize how many  years I have served you?
 Now please return to the office and  take care of that pile of documents.
 Oh, I'm done with the ones for today, though.
 What?
 Going through those is the best way  to find out what's going on out here.
 But nothing beats coming out  here and seeing it for myself,
 so I'm off to wander around.
 Please wait.
 I understand how you feel,
 but with the threats of the Spade Kingdom and the devil looming over us,
 if something were to happen...
 True. I've lost most of my mana and magic,  so there isn't much I can do right now.
 In that case, I have some  favors to ask of you, Marx.
 First...
 A Favor for Julius
 Here I go, Asta!
 Got it!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Waterball.
 Come on! You can do better than that!
 Noelle! Hit me with all you've got!
 You don't have to go easy on me  just because we're teammates!
 Fine. Don't come crying to me later.
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 I'd like you to get stronger and  fight alongside us in six months.
 Not yet... This isn't nearly enough!
 Aw, you stopped it.
 You're...
 Sally
 Sally?!
 Heya, Asta! How have you been?
 What are you doing here?
 Wait, did you escape?
 Nah, the white mushroom head brought me.
 Who are you calling a white mushroom head?
 Hey... You're the Wizard King's attendant and...
 Uh, who are you?
 Magic Item Research Lab Specially-Appointed Researcher  Makusa North
 I'm Makusa from the Magic Item Research Lab.
 Huh?
 Creating magic items?
 Yes! Lord Julius saw potential in  Sally's knowledge of magical science
 and asked her to create a new magic  item to help with the upcoming battle.
 I was against this, but...
 So, like, I need a bunch of data to make one,
 so I decided to experiment on you guys.
 Like we'd ever agree to that!
 You may have turned over a new leaf,  but who knows what you'll do?
 You got it!
 W-Wait, what are you talking about?!
 Do you remember that I promised
 you could do whatever you wanted with  my body once the battle was over?
 Well, I'm glad you remember that, too, Asta.
 Just remember! Nothing that  hurts super bad, okay?
 Is that really the problem here, Stupidsta?  What if she tries to dissect you?
 D-Dissect? She couldn't possibly...
 If so, we'll have to call off  this experiment right away.
 Then let's get started!
 Or so I'd like to say... but I think  I'll save you for last, Asta.
 The thing I'm trying to make is supposed to  increase one's mana, and you don't have any.
 Maybe I'll experiment on you first!
 A-Again, I want no part of this.
 I'm royalty, and even if I wasn't,  there's no way I'd agree to this!
 By the way, where are the other Black Bulls?
 Oh, they're all either out  training or on missions.
 They ones out training should  be back any time now.
 Gah.
 Hey, how long have you guys been there?
 Right. I just remembered  I need to do something.
 Restrain yourself, me...
 Well, see ya!
 Woohoo! So many test subjects!
 Hey!
 Stop at once!
 You are not allowed to conduct any  experiments without Makusa's or my supervision!
 Hey, look! It's the Wizard King!
 Huh?!
 There!
 Sally!
 Asta, Noelle! Please don't worry  about us! Just go after Sally!
 Got it!
 This is probably far enough.
 Like hell I'm gonna let that  crazy chick experiment on me.
 L-Let go of me! I'll kill you!
 Aw... But when the magic item's done,
 your magic's gonna get explosively stronger,  so help me out, Funglasquent.
 Who the hell are you calling a mohawked  virgin delinquent in glasses?!
 Since you use flame magic, Glasquent...
 Stop making it even shorter, damn it!
 The dark magic item equation will be this...
 And then the mana exponent  will end up like that...
 This is the experimental liquid I'll use!
 Now I'll just use my Sticky Salamander  instead of the magic item and...
 Inject!
 Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What the hell?!
 There's an insane amount of  flame mana flowing out from me.
 I know, right? Amazing, isn't it?
 Huh? H-Hey, hang on a sec!  There's too much flowing out... I'm gonna...
 e-explode...
 Huh? Maybe the dark magic item  equation is still incomplete.
 And maybe the experimental  liquid's too potent.
 But I got some data, so on to the next one!
 Don't worry! I won't dissect you!
 Transformation Magic—
 Hold it! Now's not a good time!
 Huh? But why?
 Wait, that's...
 Marie?!
 No one's laying a finger on my angel!
 B-But that's not the real Marie!
 And she's all sticky!
 Even if she's all sticky,  Marie is still Marie!
 You guys use combo magic, so it might  be fun to experiment on you both at once!
 The two of us together?! How embarrassing!
 Marie!
 Y-You can't! You said you were  going to restrain yourself!
 But this is an insanely rare  vintage I may never see again.
 Let's go, Vanessa. I'm telling you,  this is definitely a trap.
 Experiment! Experiment!
 A bewitching trail of noms.  Could this be the path to heaven?
 Welcome!
 Restrain yourself... Restrain yourself...
 E-Explode...
 Finral! Vanessa!
 Are you guys okay?!
 Huh? Did something happen?
 Looks like we got here too late.
 We need to stop Sally, quick!
 H-Heaven...
 Hm... So far, none of these  experiments are going as planned.
 I still need more data.
 Hold it, Sally!
 Charmy, are you okay?
 What's this? Asta, you're supposed to be last.
 What, you couldn't wait any longer?
 Hngh!
 I'll never go back on my word!
 You can do whatever you want with my body,  just stop messing with everyone else!
 You're still going on about that, Stupidsta?!  Maybe you won't just end up in a daze!
 Yeah, but the only reason we  made it to the royal capital is
 because Sally and the others showed up.
 That's how we protected everyone!
 So I'm going to keep my promise!
 Good point. Keeping your promises is important!
 Don't forget the anesthesia!
 Oh, don't worry. This won't hurt one bit!
 Here I come!
 Asta!
 All mine!
 I'll have to culture it when I get back!
 Wait. You just needed my hair?
 Well, remember what you said, Asta?
 You said I could experiment all I wanted  as long as I didn't harm anyone.
 Oh, yeah. You said I couldn't  bother anyone, either.
 Don't worry. They'll all be back to normal soon.
 Their magic just got too powerful for  a moment, so it sorta knocked them out.
 Sally! I guess you remembered  our promise, too!
 Aw, but Asta,
 your hair's not going to be enough,  so could I have some nail clippings, too?
 Of course!
 Wh-Why are you touching him like that?
 Actually, that's not quite enough, either,  so could I have some of your blood?
 While we're at it, maybe your heart,  your lungs, and your eyeballs?
 You most certainly can't!
 Anyway, just make sure this research  will help everyone out, okay?
 Ugh... That was awful.
 Why, you little...
 Go to hell!
 Now, now, guys. You're all better now.
 As for the results of this experiment...
 I can't understand a single thing here,  but it sure is interesting!
 Makusa will take this information back  to the capital and inspect it carefully.
 The magic item will be created after that.
 Do your best making it,  Sally and researcher guy!
 Okay!
 We will!
 Well, we ended up being guinea pigs,  so I'm hoping the data gets put to good use.
 Yeah!
 Don't you dare slack off!
 I'll kill you if you mess it up!
 What are you waiting for, Finral?  Use your spatial magic already.
 R-Right...
 I do still have seniority here...
 Let's go, Sally.
 Sure thing!
 ""I prefer doing research that helps people out.""
 Sally! See ya later!
 That might actually be true now!
 We're almost to Arandom Village.
 To think that the two of us  would end up on a mission
 together despite being in separate squads.
 This isn't a field trip.
 I will find anyone who threatens  our kingdom and strike them down.
 What in the world happened in this village?
 Lord Julius,
 I've brought the captains of the Crimson  Lion Kings and the Silver Eagles.
 Thanks! Sorry to summon you  both here when you're so busy.
 It's fine.
 What did you need, sir?
 Have you two ever heard  of a village called Arandom?
 Noble Realm
 Common Realm
 A while back when I was wande—
 Forsaken Realm
 When I was investigating  various parts of the kingdom,
 it was a small village I visited  in the Forsaken Realm.
 According to some reports, bandits have  shown up around that village lately.
 Then we should send a team  to deal with them at once.
 No, that probably won't be enough.
 I have a feeling there's something rather  unfavorable going on in this kingdom.
 Unfavorable?
 What could that be?
 So I'd like you two to conceal your  identities, interact with the villagers,
 and gather information on the bandits.
 This will be an undercover investigation.
 An undercover investigation?
 We're just wandering around in disguise!
 Um... About these disguises...
 I think these will just draw  attention in the Forsaken Realm.
 True, I can't deny that,
 but since neither of us is  familiar with how peasants live,
 our cover will be blown immediately.
 Though few, there are traveling mages who
 were once royalty or nobility,  but forsook their titles.
 Oh, I see. By the way, as for where  we should gather information...
 The village square should do.
 I agree. Lord Julius said to act casually  around those who interact with us.
 Let us go blend in with the masses.
 Is that even possible?
 Also, you probably don't need  to be so serious about this.
 How do I explain that to them?
 Forsaken Realm Arandom Village
 Th-This is...
 We'd heard there were places that  had yet to be restored, but...
 To think it'd be this bad.
 This matter will need attention eventually,
 but our mission comes first.
 I'll go gather information over there.
 And I'll head over there.
 You there.
 Huh? I don't think I've seen  you around here before.
 I'm a traveling mage named Leon.
 A-And I'm, um... Mark.
 Traveling mages?
 We heard that there were bandits around here.
 I'd like you to tell us what  you know to ensure our safety.
 No idea. Go bother someone else.
 As I thought. They're wary of us because of our disguises.
 What shall we do, Fue... I mean, Leon?
 Oh, yeah! If things get  difficult, try saying this...
 Chrono... vala.
 Chronovala?
 D-Don't tell me you're...
 You're friends of Chronovala's?
 That old lady helped us out so much!
 Whenever I didn't have enough customers,  she'd help find me some.
 I made a fortune that day!  But before I knew it, she disappeared.
 How's she doing, anyway?
 Chronovala... Chrono...
 Novachrono!
 I get it! Chronovala must be the alias  Lord Julius used when he wandered out here.
 So you know her!
 That old lady was great.
 Here, take this!
 Though my fields have been destroyed,  so I don't have much.
 I couldn't take them for free.  Will this be enough?
 Th-This much?!
 This is way too much, even if  you bought everything here!
 Then use the rest to help get  this village back on its feet.
 Are you really sure about this?!
 Wow...
 Who are those guys?
 Apparently, they know Chronovala.
 Amazing, Lord Julius. People respect  you so much, even as an old woman.
 But we've brought a lot of  attention to ourselves when this
 is supposed to be an undercover investigation.
 I hope Captain Nozel is faring better...
 You know Chronovala? She saved my baby's life!
 She did?
 I went into labor out in the fields,  and she called a doctor for me.
 I know! Here, you can hold him!
 I named him Vala.
 Wait, I—
 I haven't held a baby since Noelle was born.
 Noze...
 Noze?
 Everyone here seems to know Ju—Chronovala.
 It appears so.
 I am the mayor of this village, Mayer.
 We can't offer much, but please  stay the night in our village.
 Yeah, that's a great idea! Stay the night!
 We can't make much, but we'll treat you!
 What shall we do?
 We have no reason to decline.
 Well, he did say to act casually  with anyone we encountered.
 W-Well, if that's the case...
 I guess we never got any  information on the bandits.
 I wonder what the unfavorable  thing going on here could be.
 What is it?
 As I figured...
 Looks like they're asleep.
 Let's go.
 So you're the bandits ravaging this area!
 So what if we are? Give us all your money!
 Or you're gonna get hurt.
 Get 'em!
 Y-You're...
 The villagers?
 I was hoping that wasn't the case.
 This is the end.
 Mayor!
 We knew this would happen, even though  we were just trying to survive.
 After the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack,  our village was left in shambles.
 But we never received aid  from the royal capital
 and were driven into even worse poverty.
 Still, stealing from others in order  to try to restore our village
 was far too selfish of us.
 I was the one who led my people to do this.
 Please, let it just be me who  gets taken to the Magic Knights.
 What are you talking about?!
 You were just looking out for us!
 I had no idea they were this dismayed.
 If only we'd acted sooner,  this never would've happened.
 We can't let the mayor take  all the blame for this!
 We're going down with you.
 N-No!
 Y-You're...
 Lord Fuegoleon and Lord Nozel!
 M-M-M-Magic Knights captains?!
 What?!
 We can see that your village  is in need of assistance.
 We can let this misconduct go.
 You're too soft, as usual.  A crime is a crime.
 Do not let your emotions get in  the way. They must be judged.
 And you're being far too cruel.
 You are hereby ordered to help restore  all of the villages in this area.
 But a crime is still a crime.
 Atone for what you have done.
 D-Does that mean we're...
 The royal capital has not forsaken you.
 But we may not have been  aware of the entire situation.
 We are going to work even harder to restore  this whole kingdom. Please have faith.
 Thank you very much!
 Thus ends the report on everything  that happened in that village.
 Great job. You made the right choice.
 We've sent squad members to the other  villages to see what kind of aid they need.
 Yes. Our job is to protect this kingdom,
 as well as to make sure its  citizens can live in peace.
 By having to face the truth, perhaps your  view of this kingdom has changed a bit?
 As I thought...
 That's why he sent us.
 Nozel, Fuegoleon...
 I want you to work even harder to lead  the kingdom and the Magic Knights.
 As you wish!
 Yup. I'm counting on you two.
 Now, then... I feel like  wandering around a bit myself.
 Absolutely not.
 Aw...
 Then maybe I'll talk to Yami...
 Since there isn't much I can do right now.
 That may be true, but this kingdom  still needs you very much.
 Yuno struggles with the Golden Dawn since  they are made up of nobles and royals.
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 141: ""The Golden Family.""

 Just like Asta, Yuno has the  magic of never giving up.

141,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 Yuno, we're family, right?
 Yeah.
 But we're not related by blood.
 Yeah...
 But we're closer than anyone who's  related by blood, aren't we?
 What brought all this on?
 What I'm saying...
 is that we don't have any blood relatives,
 but all of the friends we've met,
 and all of the friends we'll meet someday,
 are people we should treasure as family.
 Yeah.
 The Golden Family
 Golden Dawn Headquarters
 Ah, are you here to deliver  your reports, as well?
 Yes. We just returned from Kiten.
 Member of the Golden Dawn Shiren Tium
 Member of the Golden Dawn Hamon Caseus
 Ah, yes. Kiten is famous for
 being a gourmet town, due to the  Diamond Kingdom's influence there.
 Member of the Golden Dawn David Slower
 Member of the Golden Dawn Letoile Becquerel
 For real? I wish I could've gone there  instead of patrolling the royal capital.
 Member of the Golden Dawn Alecdora Sandler
 This isn't a game, David.
 Yuno, aren't you tired from  these back-to-back missions?
 I'm fine.
 Getting enough calories is  important at times like this.
 Would you like one?
 I'm fine.
 This conversation's going nowhere.
 There's that insolent attitude of his again.
 After insisting he was  going to be the Wizard King,
 he earned more merit during the  Eye of the Midnight Sun conflict,
 and now he's grown even more impudent.
 If only I hadn't been possessed by an elf,  I could've helped Lord Vangeance!
 You were just lucky! That's it!
 The captain is waiting. Let's go.
 Sure.
 Yuno, why not try to be a bit friendlier?
 What? I am, though.
 He doesn't even realize it.
 I know... Why not try to smile more when  speaking, or throw in a joke here and there?
 I know I'm the one who just suggested it,
 but I can't even picture you doing that myself.
 I apologize.
 Sure.
 Looks like we have a long road ahead of us.
 Indeed.
 But that cool side of Yuno  is what makes him so amazing!
 Thank you all for your reports.
 Klaus, Mimosa, Yuno...
 We've received thanks yet again  from the people of Kiten.
 Captain of the Golden Dawn William Vangeance
 Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn Langris Vaude
 It looks like you did well.
 Yes, sir.
 You honor us with those words.
 Now, I realize that you've just come back,
 but I have another mission for you.
 It seems a herd of wild boars  has come down from the mountains
 to Saussy Village, putting it in danger.
 I'd like to send another squad there,  but everyone else is already out.
 Allow me to handle it! I can  handle wild boars on my own!
 If they were regular wild boars, perhaps.
 According to reports,
 the wild boars near Saussy Village are  magical beasts covered in flames.
 The villagers are anxious.
 I'd like all of you to go there as a  squad and take care of the situation.
 I will have Alecdora lead this mission.
 Yes, sir!
 I'm counting on all of you.
 Yes, sir!
 I don't care who or what we're up against!
 Saussy Village
 I will earn more merit than you!
 T-To think that the Golden Dawn  would come to our rescue.
 I guess it's not the Black Bulls...
 Yeah. I was hoping to see Asta again.
 You know Asta?
 Yeah!
 Asta, Noelle, and Magna protected  this village from the bad guys!
 Come to think of it,  Saussy Village was the place
 where the Eye of the  Midnight Sun was first sighted.
 But did you know? The Black Bulls  beat up some wild boars, too!
 Oh? Then why don't we make a little bet?
 Let's see who can beat up more wild  boars: the Golden Dawn or the Black—
 David.
 We've heard the boars are covered  in flames and very dangerous.
 Yes, and they've grown even  more violent than last time.
 We just don't know what to do anymore.
 Yikes, what's that?
 I sense a powerful mana from them  that's unique to magical beasts.
 The villagers stand no chance against them.
 Shiren, get us a closer look.
 As you wish.
 Stone Creation Magic: Stone Model of the World.
 We'll split up and take care of those  things before they harm the villagers.
 Yes, sir!
 Please wait.
 If we don't find out what  caused them to grow violent,
 the same thing will happen again.
 He does bring up a fair point.
 Know your place, Yuno!
 It is I that Lord Vangeance put  in charge of this mission, not you.
 If merely defeating them would suffice,
 the Black Bulls would be capable of that, too.
 Why, you...
 Y-Yuno...
 If you feel that strongly  about it, then prove it!
 The rest of us will wipe out the boars!
 Yes, sir.
 Roger!
 Let us make a grand entrance.
 So what do you plan on doing?
 There's something I want to find.
 Mimosa...
 Y-Yes?
 Sand Magic: Suppressing Sand Mass!
 I am quite curious as to  how these creatures taste.
 Dice Magic: Gambler's Fallacy.
 A one, eh? Too bad.
 I guess this is enough for you guys, though.
 Wind Magic: Crescent Moon Sickle!
 Steel Magic: Blazing Spiral Lance!
 There's an area just ahead where mana is highly concentrated.
 Let's go.
 Right.
 It looks like that fruit is  what's causing all this.
 I see. No wonder they've turned violent.
 We'll have to get rid of all  the trees that bear this fruit.
 All right. You and I will take  care of the trees in this area.
 Mimosa, try to find out if there are  any trees with the fruit around here.
 Of course.
 I was worried about what  might happen earlier, but...
 If it's to protect the people,
 he's willing to defy his superiors  to do what he needs to do.
 I doubt he even realizes  he showed any defiance.
 Thank you so much,  knights of the Golden Dawn!
 I can't believe you even tracked down  the reason these things went berserk!
 Now we probably won't need  to trouble you again!
 I'm glad to hear that.
 You think you got one up on me, do you?!
 What in the world are those collars?
 Aren't they adorable?
 Apparently they decided to keep the  boars that have now calmed down.
 Tell Asta, will ya?
 I want him to know I'm training  real hard with my magic!
 I'm gonna become a Magic Knight,  so he has to become the Wizard King!
 Okay. I'll be sure to tell him.
 But it's not Asta who's going to  become the Wizard King. It's me.
 Wait, really?
 Well done, everyone.
 Now the villagers won't have  to live in fear anymore.
 I'd like you to be able to relax now,  but I have an urgent mission.
 A newly-appeared dungeon has  been occupied by someone.
 It is located near the  Diamond Kingdom's border.
 It's near Kiten.
 There are reports that people have  seen Spade soldiers fighting in this area.
 We can't deny that the Spade  Kingdom may be involved.
 This is an emergency,
 but as long as the chaos continues  in the kingdom, I cannot make a move.
 Langris, I'd like you to take the lead if you can.
 I'd love to, but my wounds have yet to heal.
 Why not let someone else handle it?
 I see. If you insist.
 Alecdora, I ask that you  take the lead once again.
 Yes, sir!
 This time I'll prove once and for all
 that I am the one more useful  to Lord Vangeance!
 Are you sure Alecdora was the right choice?
 What do you mean?
 I was just thinking there's another  candidate who may be more qualified.
 And who might that be?
 I heard that he was able to  wrangle countless Magic Knights
 from around the kingdom in  mere moments during the battle
 with the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 He also has plenty of talent  and the skill to lead.
 Though he is rather impertinent and annoying.
 Wh-What is it, sir?
 You've changed. Of course,  I mean that in a good way.
 I-I'm just thinking of the best way to ensure the mission succeeds.
 You see, Langris,
 I want Alecdora to change, too.
 Like you have.
 Ah, it appears as though we  have some bandits on our hands.
 It's probably in our favor that  they aren't from the Spade Kingdom.
 Want me to go take care of them real quick?
 Leave it to me.
 Sand Binding Magic: Sand Box!
 Well done!
 Mimosa, show us the inside of the dungeon.
 Yes, sir.
 This is most likely where the treasure room is.
 There are two paths leading to it.
 So we come in from either the front or the top.
 We'll split up into two teams.
 Shiren, Hamon, Letoile,  and I will go from the front.
 Klaus, Mimosa, David, and...
 Yuno. You'll go from the top.
 Understood.
 Magic Knights?!
 What the hell are the lookouts doing?
 Wind Magic: Crescent Moon Sickle!
 I don't think so!
 He stopped Yuno's spell?!
 I'm not done yet!
 Steel Creation Magic: Full Metal Fortress!
 They sure have some decent  magic for a bunch of bandits.
 Those are magic items.
 They must be enhancing their mana with them.
 But...
 Wind Creation Magic: Wind Blade Shower!
 That won't be enough to stop us.
 We'll hold them off here!
 Take this!
 Stone Creation Magic: Pursuing Crushed Rock!
 What?!
 The treasures in this dungeon belong to us!
 I must say, there's nothing  beautiful about being a bandit.
 Glass Creation Magic: Verre Épée!
 Letoile!
 Die!
 Willful Compass!
 How dare you use wind magic in front of me?!
 Sand Magic: Sand-Armored Guard!
 I will not shy away from fighting these bandits!
 I will get back all of those magic items!
 It appears we arrived at the same time.
 Boo! I was hoping I could get  you to treat me to something.
 What? You're here already?
 I guess peasant bandits aren't  even useful for stalling.
 I even let them borrow some magic items.
 Though they're just trash  compared to what I have.
 Then I'm assuming you're  aware that you're also trash.
 That's not a nice thing to say  to a former senior Magic Knight,
 you wannabe Magic Knights.
 You have no chance of winning!
 It'd be in your interest to cooperate.
 I have to wonder about that.
 Sand Binding Magic: Sand-Armored Heavy Guard!
 Oh? Sand magic, eh?
 A perfect match for my black earth magic.
 Black Earth Creation Magic: Sludge Erosion!
 Alecdora!
 Plant Recovery Magic:  Dream-Healing Flower Cradle!
 Guess you're tougher than you look.
 Looks like you're down one now, though.
 Well, this is rather troublesome.
 Someone with enough talent  to become a Magic Knight
 has a magic item that increases his mana.
 But there's only one of him.
 We still have the advantage.
 I'm sure he's aware of that, too.
 That confidence... Is he hiding something?
 Well, no use thinking about it.
 Regardless of what our enemy may do,  we shall strike back beautifully.
 Glass Creation Magic: Verre Fleur!
 Whoa, now!
 Steel Creation Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!
 Come on, now. Is this all you  new Magic Knights can do?
 Compass Magic: Willful Compass!
 Huh... Well, that magic's interesting.
 This is even more interesting!
 Dice Magic: Gambler's Fallacy!
 Looks like my luck's turning around.
 But your luck ends right here.
 What?!
 This is the biggest prize in this dungeon.
 No matter how powerful a  spell is, it sucks it right up.
 What?!
 Bell...
 Yes, sir! Guess it's finally my turn.
 Wind Magic: Swift White Bow!
 That goes for spirit magic, too.
 That just felt like a gentle breeze to me.
 Ugh! What is that stupid thing?!
 So what will you do now? I think  you understand what's going on here.
 Yeah, it's crystal clear.
 That's the best you've got as a mage,  despite having help from magic items.
 You're no match for the Golden Dawn.
 I think hunting wild boars would be  more enjoyable than fighting you.
 If you're trying to piss me off,  it's not gonna work, you stupid brat.
 You look pretty mad to me.
 It's just as Yuno said.
 We're not going to lose to a sad man  who has to rely on magic items.
 We'd bring shame to the  Golden Dawn if we backed down now.
 Now, let us have a beautiful battle.
 I'll suck up all of your mana, just as you asked!
 We're not done yet!
 You guys don't know when to give up, do you?
 You shouldn't move yet, Alecdora.
 I'm fine now, Mimosa.
 More importantly, please support Shiren.
 Find a spot with faint mana.
 I will look for weak spots in the cave.
 Right.
 Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!
 How long are you gonna keep this up?
 Impossible... He's...
 Damn it. Guess you aren't dead yet.
 I'll end it with this strike!
 Steel Magic: Blazing Spiral Lance!
 Dice Magic: Gambler's Fallacy!
 I think this'll be enough.
 All right, fine! Let's find out what'll come first:
 my magic items breaking or  you running out of mana!
 We're not aiming for you.
 Compass Magic: Willful Compass!
 A pitfall? This is what they were after?
 Ugh, you sure don't know how  to treat spirits properly.
 I still have this!
 This is the end of the line for you.
 I told you! I have the obvious  advantage against your magic!
 And I'm sure I told you, too...
 that you're no match for the Golden Dawn.
 Thank you for leading the group, Alecdora.
 I became unable to fight at one point  in our battle against the bandits.
 This mission was only successful  because of the others.
 Is that so, Yuno?
 Alecdora's orders were meticulous.
 Why are you defending me?
 I'm only speaking the truth.
 Then allow me to say this, too.
 There were many members of the  Golden Dawn who looked down on you
 for being a peasant.
 They despised you and were  jealous of your powers.
 That includes myself, too.
 Why in the world would you have  to defend the likes of them?
 Because they're my comrades.
 I don't need a reason to know that my  comrades are important to me.
 I also looked down on peasants  just because of their status.
 But after being rescued by  a peasant with no magic,
 I decided to reconsider some things.
 Please don't compare me to him.
 Y-Yuno!
 I'm sorry.
 I don't know why you're apologizing.
 I'm sure you really don't.
 But I won't be satisfied if I don't say it.
 Just so you know, I still haven't  acknowledged you, though.
 Are you here to report to Lord Vangeance?
 Yes.
 Then let's all go get something  to eat after we're done reporting.
 This is the perfect opportunity for  Yuno to bond with the others!
 Yes, we'd be happy to!
 Yuno, wait!
 Yuno...
 We're also inviting you... rather,  this invitation was specifically for you, Yuno.
 Huh? No, I...
 Hamon knows a number of places around  the royal capital that serve delicious food.
 Let's just invite the whole  gang and have a blast!
 We don't have any blood relatives,
 but all of the friends we've met,
 and all of the friends we'll meet someday,
 are people we should treasure as family.
 What do you think, Yuno?
 Yuno, are you embarrassed?
 I am not.
 You are, though.
 I am not.
 Ooh, let me see!
 Absolutely not!
 In order to fight against the threats  of the Spade Kingdom and the devil,
 we're going to get even stronger!

142,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 He puts in blood, sweat, and tears  in hopes of becoming the Wizard King.
 But there are also those in the kingdom  who possess at least a little bit of mana,
 yet can barely use any magic at all.
 The very few out of the population,  those who live in the shadows...
 They are also trying to survive.
 Those Remaining
 Looking back a bit, to just before
 Tiulyu Town
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun  attacked the royal capital...
 This town was neither rich nor poor,
 neither big nor small.
 A very mundane town found  in the Common Realm.
 Ow...
 Endure it. It'll get better soon enough.
 Thank you.
 It's fine.
 Are you all right?
 Yes.
 I should go.
 You can stay a while.  No one's going to come by.
 I'd love to, but he'll be home soon.
 I see.
 See you later.
 See you later.
 It's as delicious as ever. Thank you, Dazu.
 It's nothing.
 It really is delicious. At least you can cook.
 Tell me about it.
 Oh, dear. It looks like my soup has  gotten cold while we were talking.
 I'll reheat it right away.
 You don't need to go all the way  back to the kitchen for that.
 Go on. Warm it up with your magic.
 That's a great idea.
 Then allow me to borrow some  of your flame magic, Mother,
 and some of your spatial magic, dear.
 Ah, it looks like it's warmed up.
 Your catalyst magic really does come in handy.
 You can borrow magic from  others and use it for yourself.
 Impressive indeed.
 Indeed.
 My, it's delicious.
 Run away!
 Mommy!
 Someone help me!
 Accursed humans...
 You will face the wrath of the elves!
 Now is the time for our revenge!
 Dear! Mother! Hang in there!
 H-Hurry and help us...
 Hurry up, you stupid...
 It's too early for it to be dawn.
 Curse you, human...
 That's... the magic of the  Captain of the Golden Dawn.
 How beautiful...
 Did they save the kingdom?
 A Few Days Later
 Something wrong?
 Look...
 ""The Devil's Servants""?
 ""The Magic Parliament will  put Magic Knights on trial
 on suspicion of communicating with  the devil and using forbidden magic.""
 Apparently that incident  affected the entire kingdom.
 According to the rumors,  those who attacked everyone
 were being controlled by the devil  and had gained terrifying powers.
 Devil... Terrifying powers?
 The devil... did this?
 I would like all of you to train your  squad members as much as you can.
 We only have six months,
 but do everything you can to  raise everyone's magic stages
 so that we can face the Spade Kingdom  and protect this kingdom.
 So, Damnatio, does that work for you?
 Whatever do you mean?
 In order to defeat the devil, the Magic Knights
 will have to get stronger  in the next six months.
 I'd like you to think about  what to do with Asta
 after we've taken care of this matter  with the Spade Kingdom, if you would.
 I have no objections.
 What's the meaning of this?!
 The Black Bull named Asta  and that woman named Nero...
 You're going to wait six months to  try those servants of the devil?!
 It's just as I explained it.
 Our top priority now is to cooperate with  the Magic Knights and the Heart Kingdom
 so that we can face the threats of  the Spade Kingdom and the devil.
 But—
 This has already been decided.
 Are you truly okay with that, Lord Damnatio?
 I am not. But there is an order to things...
 And priorities.
 Then that's all the more reason  to execute that devil first!
 The chaos in our kingdom caused  by the Eye of the Midnight Sun
 was the work of the devil, was it not?!
 My nephew was among the victims...
 Enough.
 B-But to ensure the safety  and peace of our citizens,
 we should execute them immediately!
 That's why the Magic Parliament—
 Take your leave!
 P-Please excuse me.
 The Wizard King has Lord Damnatio  dancing in the palm of his hand.
 We're going to leave servants of  the devil be for six months? Impossible!
 I must bring the scales of justice that
 have tilted toward the darkness  back to the light.
 I must bring peace and harmony  back to this kingdom.
 That's him?
 Yes, there's no doubt about it.
 He hates the devil even more than  others in the Magic Parliament.
 Let's go.
 Pardon me.
 Master Kabwe, I presume?
 I am indeed Kabwe. Have we met before?
 No, we have not.
 May we have some of your time?
 I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy...
 I lost my family in the attack  by the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Not just my family. My town  burned, and many perished.
 I'm sorry to hear that.
 There are many in this kingdom  who are suffering just as you are.
 Yes, you're exactly right.
 Are you not also going through  the same thing, Kabwe?
 How did you know that?
 We want your help so that we can  seek revenge for the many victims.
 My help?
 What do you intend to do?
 I... We want to destroy the servants  of the devil with our own hands.
 The servants of the devil?
 It appears that I'll have  to hear more about this.
 Yes.
 That would be appreciated.
 As the royal capital began to calm down
 after the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack...
 The Wizard King Julius Novachrono was
 swamped with paperwork from  the aftermath of the attack,
 and the Magic Knights were  training vigorously daily so that
 they could take on the threats of  the Spade Kingdom and the devil.
 What's wrong, Noelle?
 Come at me more! Come on!
 I could keep going, but I'm a bit  thirsty. Let's take a little break.
 I'm not thirsty yet, though!
 But I am! And I'm royalty!
 You always say that, but that has  nothing to do with anything, does it?
 Shut up! I said we're taking a break,  so we're taking a break!
 You just keep working out,  then, Meathead Asta.
 What's Noelle so mad about?  What do you think, Nero?
 Dunno.
 Guess I will work out, then.
 One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six!
 Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten! Eleven!
 Twelve! Thirteen! Fourteen! Fifteen! Sixteen!
 Hey, Gauche, Finral.
 Hey, Noelle. Could you get  me a glass of water, too?
 Get one yourself.
 Again, I have seniority here...
 The hideout sure is quiet today.
 Everyone but Henry is out training.
 And you're slacking?
 I'm just taking a short break!
 What about you? Were you off seeing Marie again?
 What?
 Wh-What?
 I was training this good-for-nothing.
 I'm going to go serve my angel, Marie, later.
 So you are going.
 Yeah, I'm beat.
 The combo move we came up with using my  spatial magic and his mirror magic...
 The timing's just been impossible to get down.
 I need to go cleanse my body  before I go see my angel.
 It'd be rude to go see her drenched in sweat.
 Sister Theresa's apparently  gone until tonight.
 Apparently, all the sisters from the  church are getting together or something.
 So he's going to go see her  before the sister comes back.
 Or rather, he's forcing me to take him...
 When the cat's away,  the mice will, well, you know...
 Marie, I'll come to see you soon.
 Gauche, I'll wash your back for you.
 I hope you'll wash my back, too.
 1,090! 1,091! 1,092! 1,093!
 1,094! 1,095! 1,096! 1,097!
 1,098! 1,099! 1,100! 1,101!
 How long is he going to keep that up?
 1,102! 1,103! 1,104! 1,105! 1,106!
 Maybe I should take him something to eat.
 Even I can make a sandwich.
 A Town in the Common Realm, Nean
 Here it comes, Marie!
 There!
 Nice kick!
 There. That must be her.
 Yes. That's Marie Adlai.
 The daughter of a fallen noble. Her older  brother is a former criminal, and...
 She was controlled by a devil during the  attack and harmed many innocent people.
 Let's take care of this before the  old hag from the church returns.
 Indeed.
 I'm sorry.
 Servant of the devil...  You're coming with me!
 You brat...
 What are you doing to Marie?!
 Are you planning to take her again?
 We won't let you take her!
 No way!
 Little brats...
 Who the heck are they?
 H-Hey! Theresa! Theresa!
 Theresa's out right now.
 Th-They're trying to take Marie!
 Wh-Who are you guys?!
 Neige!
 We are the Devil Banishers!
 Devil... I won't let you take Marie!
 Snow Magic: Snow Cry!
 Of course this happens  when Theresa isn't here...
 There are more of them?
 Snow Magic—
 Wh-When did they...
 I couldn't sense their mana.
 Neige!
 Hey! Stop! Let go!
 Stop!
 Everyone!
 You're not getting away again,  servant of the devil.
 But I'm not a servant of the devil...
 We must return the scale that's tilted toward darkness back to the light.
 Y-You lot!
 What are you going to do with her?!
 We need to contact the Magic Knights!
 Let's go!
 Marie...
 Marie!
 Marie!
 Someone... Save me! Big Brother! Big Brother!
 What's the matter?
 I thought I heard an angel  call for me just now.
 You're hearing things.
 I'm sure Marie must be anxious to see me, too.
 What in the world is that?  Is that for the magical beasts?
 How rude! It's a sandwich!
 If you want a bite, just say so!
 No, I don't want it.
 Hey, Finral.
 Wake up! Let's go.
 Sure, whatever.
 Seriously, none of you know  how to treat a senior comrade.
 All right, Noelle. We're going out for a bit.
 Not a bit. We'll be gone for a while!
 If Yami finds out, I'm gonna  get a scolding, too.
 Here.
 Now, I should...
 8,122! 8,123! 8,124! 8,125!
 8,126! 8,127! 8,128!
 How long are you going to do this?
 Until 10,000!
 Wait... 8,003?! No!
 I lost count because you talked to me!
 Now I need to start back at one!
 One, two, three, four, five, six...
 That must be Asta.
 Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve...
 Yes. He has no mana and cannot use magic,  but somehow he joined the Magic Knights.
 Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...
 He's nothing but a filthy devil's servant.
 Let's do this.
 All is according to plan.
 131, 132, 133, 134...
 135... 136?
 Huh? Only one person?
 What's the matter?
 Hey, talk to me! What happened?
 T-Take this, please.
 What is this?
 Poison?
 Your mixing abilities are quite impressive.
 Thank you.
 I thought we only had the  devil-possessed boy here,
 but apparently the girl who used  forbidden magic is here, too.
 Luck must be on our side.
 So this is Nero.
 Look at those horns... She's clearly a devil.
 They're proof that she used forbidden magic.
 Now, let us capture them.
 Stop!
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Let go!
 How can he be so strong?!
 I'm losing consciousness...
 Let go of Nero!
 Asta...
 What are you doing?!
 Get away from Asta and Nero!
 Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!
 My body... Crap! I'm gonna di...

 Let's go!
 You're not getting away!
 It seems really noisy outside...
 Asta! Nero!
 She's fast!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Waterball!
 Crap!
 Let's give up for now.
 Yes.
 I a-apologize...
 Transparency Magic:
 Share the Same Fate!
 Hold it! Who are you?!
 We are the Devil Banishers.
 We wish for the demise of the devil.
 You're not getting away! Give Nero back!
 I can't sense their mana.
 Nero!
 Asta!
 How could they do that to little children?
 Wh-What's going on?
 It's terrible! Marie was...
 What?!
 Asta, wake up!
 Asta!
 Asta, don't die!
 Make one of your stupid faces and laugh! Asta!

143,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 He puts in blood, sweat, and tears  in hopes of becoming the Wizard King.
 But there are also those in the kingdom  who possess at least a little bit of mana,
 yet can barely use any magic at all.
 The very few out of the population,  those who live in the shadows...
 They are also trying to survive.
 Run away!
 Mommy!
 Someone help me!
 On that night in the Clover Kingdom
 when chaos reigned due to the  reincarnation of the elves...
 Dear! Mother! Hang in there!
 Dazu, who lived in a town called Tiulyu,  lost her husband and mother-in-law.
 Along with another resident of  Tiulyu named Bow, she decided
 to confront Kabwe,  a member of the Magic Parliament.
 Kabwe hated devils immensely, and the fact that
 Asta, Nero, and Marie, who were supposed  to be sentenced for being devil-possessed,
 had their trial delayed by Damnatio made  Kabwe resent the situation even more.
 They eventually took action.
 They assumed the title ""Devil Banishers""  and kidnapped Marie from the church in Nean.
 You're not getting away again,  servant of the devil.
 But I'm not a servant of the devil...
 We must return the scale that's tilted toward darkness back to the light.
 Let's go!
 Someone... Save me!
 Big Brother! Big Brother!
 Around the same time,
 Asta and Nero were put to sleep so  they could be taken away, but...
 Let go of Nero!
 Asta...
 What are you doing?!
 Get away from Asta and Nero!
 Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!
 My body... Crap! I'm gonna di...
 Let's hurry and take them.

 Water—
 Let's go!
 Asta! Nero!
 She's fast!
 Sea Dragon's Waterball!
 Noelle stopped them.
 But in the end, Nero was still taken.
 And Asta....
 Hold it! Who are you?!
 We are the Devil Banishers.
 We wish for the demise of the devil.
 You're not getting away! Give Nero back!
 Asta!
 Wake up!
 Asta!
 The Tilted Scale
 I see you made it safely.
 How did things go?
 We had no problems.
 Where's Asta?
 We apologize.
 Someone got in the way.
 I see.
 But by now, he should be...
 in a deep sleep.
 How is Asta? He's still alive, isn't he?!
 Don't worry, he's alive.
 Then why won't he open his eyes?
 Even if he's alive, what if he's under some  spell that will keep him asleep forever?
 Don't worry. Asta's not  asleep because of a spell.
 Huh?
 I see. The reason Asta's still asleep is...
 E-Excuse me!
 What possessed you to bring  me here all of a sudden?
 Asta?!
 So the kid's still asleep?
 What do you mean, he's not  asleep because of a spell?
 You're not gonna suggest it's some  sleeping potion, are you, you quack?
 That's exactly it.
 It's quite surprising, really.
 I don't know who did it, but to think  someone could make one this powerful...
 Why would anyone have a sleeping potion?
 That, I can't answer.
 If he just continues to rest for a while,  he should wake up on his own.
 Thank goodness.
 So since they put him to sleep, they weren't  planning to kill him right off the bat.
 First, let's see what exactly happened to Asta.
 A Town in the Common Realm, Nean
 Damn it, you old hag! This is the third time!
 The third time?
 That's how many times Marie's  been put in danger!
 First was when these assholes took her!
 Then it was the trial, and now this!
 The third time's the charm!
 Now I'm gonna kill you!
 Gauche! You shouldn't be  so rough with the elderly!
 You can shut your mouth!
 This isn't even about seniority  anymore! You're just rude!
 Even though this happened while I was gone,  I have nothing to say in my defense.
 But isn't there something  more important you need to do
 before you try to strangle an old lady?
 Where's Marie?!
 Hey, you! What the hell happened to Marie?!
 Y-You're...
 Tell me or I'll kill you!
 S-Some masked guys calling themselves  the Devil Banishers took Marie...
 Who the hell are they?!
 I-I have no idea! But they  said something weird...
 Quit wasting my time and spit it out!
 I think it was, ""We must return  the scale that's tilted
 toward darkness back to the light.""
 Scale?!
 What is this?
 Poison?
 Your mixing abilities are quite impressive.
 Thank you.
 Talk about some creepy-ass masks.
 My body... Crap! I'm gonna di...
 That's it.
 Well, they sure fell for a lame-ass trick.
 Thinking back,
 their spells weren't that powerful.
 Maybe they did that so the other  Black Bulls wouldn't sense their mana.
 That's probably why Henry  didn't wake up, too.
 Come on, Yami! Knock that off!
 Not only did these assholes attack  my hideout while I was gone,
 they took one of my squad members, too.
 I don't know who the hell they are,  but they sure wanted to test my patience.
 Wh-What's that sound?
 Chairman Damnatio, what was that sound?
 Does no one in the Black Bulls  know how to use a door?
 Where's Marie?
 Marie? Did something happen to your sister?
 Don't give me that!
 I know you took her again!
 You must be joking.
 You're really gonna act like you don't know?
 I'm not acting, but...
 Considering everything you  just did, you must be judged.
 You two should move back.
 Yes, sir.
 This is what he did last time.
 Scale Magic: Scale Regulate.
 You were imprisoned once.
 Looks like I'll have to send  you back to that life.
 Just try it, you bastard!
 Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray!
 Chairman Damnatio!
 Mirror Magic: Real Double!
 He created a clone of himself with a mirror?
 Too bad for you! I saw your  stupid magic at the trial.
 Don't think we'll fall for that again.
 It appears you've underestimated me.
 On your knees!
 Wh-What the hell?!
 Seize them.
 Y-Yes, sir!
 Looks like you've been taking  good care of my squad once again.
 Look, I know how much you hate him,  but isn't this kinda out of the blue?
 Also, who gave you permission to use my wheels?
 Wheels...
 Do you know how much mana I had to  waste to come here because of that?
 Didn't he just say it was easy as pie earlier?
 Why did you do this?
 Because mole-chin over there took Marie again!
 Enough.
 Then who the hell did it?!
 I know those masked bastards said,
 ""We must return the scale that's tilted  toward darkness back to the light.""
 That's exactly the kind of bullshit you'd say!
 Did you just say ""masked bastards""?
 And what if I did?!
 You did, didn't you?
 I didn't see... I didn't see them myself, but...
 What?! It wasn't just Marie?!
 We managed to get the kid back, but Nero was...
 So it was you!
 I cannot fathom how you  came to that conclusion.
 First Marie, then Asta and Nero...
 They're the three that you put on trial!
 You were just trying to take  them out by force this time!
 Hell, I don't even care what  you do to Asta and Nero!
 Uh, hello?!
 Give Marie back!
 Marx, show them my memories.
 Very well.
 Once my innocence is proven, you will  pay dearly for your insolence toward me.
 There's no memory that suggests  he knew about the kidnapping.
 It appears my innocence has been proven.
 Not only did you do all of this,  but you accused me of kidnapping.
 You will be taking responsibility for that.
 Fine. Do whatever you want with me.
 But it's gonna have to wait until I save Marie.
 I don't believe that was part of our deal.
 Hold it.
 That guy you were arguing  with doesn't seem to be here.
 Is he so careless that he wouldn't  even show up after all this ruckus?
 Lord Julius.
 What's the matter?
 Sorry to butt in when things are so crazy,
 but there's something I'd like  Yami and the others to see.
 Now's not the time...
 He should be there at any moment.
 Begging your pardon.
 Nozel!
 The signal
 is from the bracelet-type  communication magic item
 that we used to track Asta's  whereabouts at all times.
 There currently seems to be a signal from  the town of Tiulyu in the Common Realm.
 Which means...
 Someone took it off of him?
 The only ones who know about the bracelet
 are the few who were present back then.
 And the only one I can think of who  could actually get it off is Nero.
 She's probably trying to use the  bracelet to let us know where she is.
 Then there's a good chance  Marie's in that town, too. Fin—
 Finral, let's go!
 I'm sorry, but I've never been to Tiulyu.
 Tch. Then I guess we're gonna  have to use our brooms.
 Captain!
 I'll be going, too.
 My best friend's little sister  is basically my little sister.
 What?! Who are you calling  your little sister?!
 Please wait! This may be a trap.
 Shut up, you stupid mushroom!
 Mush—?!
 I don't care if it's a damn trap.  It's the only clue we have!
 Gauche's right. We're going.
 Wait.
 I'm not done talking to that criminal over there.
 What?!
 Read the room, you asshole!
 While we're wasting time here,  my squad members are—
 Yami...
 I ordered the Black Bulls to  keep an eye on Nero, did I not?
 And?
 The Devil Banishers, was it?
 I'll need you to get her back from that  group and continue watching over her.
 So I'd like you to postpone   your judgment until then.
 What do you say, Damnatio?
 Understood.
 Well, I'm counting on you, Yami.
 Right.
 Oh, one more thing.
 You're still not done?
 I know you probably don't feel great  since one of your own has been kidnapped.
 But this is different from the trial.
 Depending on what you do, you may be  putting your squad members in danger.
 I know that.
 Well, let's go, dumbasses.
 Right.
 I'll go, too.
 Wha?
 Nozel?
 Nozel, why are you helping us this much?
 I'd rather not lose any of the forces needed
 to eliminate the devil over  something like this. That is all.
 You're just worried about your  little sister, aren't ya?
 Stop trying to act all cool, Mr. Hubris.
 Say another word and you'll  regret it, foreigner.
 Didn't you just say something about  not wanting to lose any of our forces?
 That must be it.
 Tiulyu Town
 This town...
 The Eye of the Midnight Sun must  have come through here, too.
 Wait for me, Marie!
 This is...
 What's up?
 Oh, is this another magic item that  blocks mana tracking, like this one?
 I doubt we'll have to worry about anyone  tracking us out here, but just in case.
 It appears they're doing what  they can to block the signal.
 Did they find the bracelet?
 They might have. Either way,  we should be cautious.
 I don't think we had to  land this far away, though.
 Are you stupid?
 What?!
 It's not just Marie and Nero over there.  Their kidnappers are with them, too.
 What do you think will happen  if we just suddenly show up?
 Gauche...
 Yes?
 You got a picture of your sister?
 What do you plan to do with it?!
 Don't get any weird ideas!  We need it so we can ask around!
 True...
 You better give them back when you're done!
 Right...
 You never know what's gonna happen.
 Always watch your back.  Don't go into the town alone.
 Looks like the G-G Duo's back!
 I don't remember teaming up with you.
 There's no need to be embarrassed.
 Let's go, Noelle.
 Right!
 So that leaves me with...
 You got a problem with me?
 A-Absolutely not.
 It seems mostly untouched.
 There are only so many forces we can  send to help with their restoration.
 Looks like the damage here  was pretty heavy, and yet...
 Yami...
 Yeah... I wonder how many  more graves popped up
 after the Eye of the Midnight Sun attacked.

 I-Is that a no?
 Wh-What did you say? I couldn't hear you.
 Are you sure I'm good enough?
 Of course! Dazu, I...
 I want you to be my wife.
 You're so hardworking, Dazu.
 Mother.
 You don't even use magic,
 but you still manage to do just  as much work as the rest of us.
 Yami...
 Yeah... I wonder how many  more graves popped up
 after the Eye of the Midnight Sun attacked.
 H-Hey there, miss...
 There's something we'd like to ask you.
 What's that?
 Have you seen this girl before?
 Also, did you happen to see a really cute  girl with horns growing out of her head?
 Horns? What do you mean?
 Then...
 Maybe you've heard something
 about a group of people who  hate devils getting together?
 Is there anyone who doesn't hate the devil?
 You're talking about what caused  the tragedy here recently, right?
 Yeah.
 You're Magic Knights, aren't you?
 Yeah.
 My husband and his mother died that day.
 Why didn't you come to help us?
 We were stretched too thin ourselves.  The whole kingdom was a mess...
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry we couldn't protect your family.
 If you'll excuse me.
 That silver hair and cross...  They must be from the Silva family.
 What are royals doing here?
 Hey, don't stare so much.
 Hey, I have a question.
 Have you seen this girl?
 Huh? I, uh...
 She's really cute.
 We're looking for her and another  girl with horns on her head.
 If you've seen them, tell me.
 What do you mean by horns?
 So you haven't seen them? Okay, then.
 R-Right...
 Hey, I have a question for you.
 Huh?
 Have you seen this girl?
 No, I haven't. Please excuse me.
 Take a closer look!
 Sorry, I'm a bit busy.
 My house was destroyed,  and I have to rebuild it.
 I just have so much to do.
 Wait!
 Don't chase them.
 Nozel...
 The people of this town...
 They're not making it obvious,
 but many of them hold a grudge  against the Magic Knights
 and resent how the kingdom has handled things.
 I can't blame them.
 When this town was in danger,  we couldn't do anything for them.
 You're right...
 We won't be able to get any useful  information by being forceful.
 But if we don't hurry, Nero and Marie will be...
 We are indeed in a hurry, but no  good ever came out of panicking.
 If you're a true Magic Knight, you need  to remain calm in these situations.
 Right...
 Questioning them isn't the only thing  we can do. Let's try something else.
 Right!
 Marie!
 Hey! What are you doing?
 You're not Marie...
 What are you trying to do to my daughter?
 Sorry!
 But I'm a bit desperate here!
 I have to back him up since he's  my partner in the G-G Duo!
 Please forgive us. You can have this, okay?
 Stay away from my daughter, you creeps!
 Try not to mistake someone  else for Marie again.
 Shut your trap!
 If I sense it might be Marie, I'm going to act!
 Damn it! Marie!
 Where are you?! My angel Marie! Answer me!
 You can't shout like that!
 You called?
 The hell?
 You just called my name.
 And you called me an angel.
 No one's ever called me that,  even when I was younger.
 What the hell are you yapping  about, you old hag?
 Um, what is your name?
 My name's Maggie.
 We're looking for Marie!
 Oh, my. I guess that's different.
 So close...
 Something must've happened.
 Yes.
 We can talk down below.
 Welcome back, Dazu.
 Good work out there.
 Thank you.
 How long are we going to hide down here?
 We should just execute these two already.
 There's an even bigger  problem on our hands now.
 The Magic Knights are here.
 What?
 Did they track us?
 No, that's not possible.
 Master Kabwe's transparency spell  made us disappear flawlessly.
 Maybe they planted something...
 Transparency Magic: Detection Decoder.
 There it is!
 This is...
 A magic item to keep tabs  on one who is devil-possessed!
 What's it doing here?
 Curses! How underhanded!
 Please wait.
 I have an idea.
 Hey, did you guys get any information?
 The townspeople wouldn't  tell us anything useful.
 We tried to find somewhere they'd use as  a hideout, but nothing has turned up.
 I'm trying to track mana,  but can't pinpoint a target.
 And...
 The signal still seems unstable.
 On top of that, we don't know when they'll  notice that communication magic item.
 We need to find those two  before they find it.
 What about you two?
 We were talking with an old woman.
 She wasn't so bad.
 Why the hell did you two even come here?
 I'm serious about this!
 I'm just doing whatever will find those  assholes who took Marie the fastest!
 What's up, Bangs?
 They're on the move.
 Where?!
 Did they let down their defense?
 I'm not sure, but this is weird.
 I'm sure they realize we're in town.
 This could be a diversion.
 All right. Gordon and I will  investigate this town a bit more.
 You guys can borrow my wheels.
 Very well. That'll make  getting back somewhat easier.
 Even Captain Nozel's using  me as an errand boy?!
 Get on. We're going after them.
 That worked like a charm.
 This should buy us some time.
 Curse those Magic Knights.
 During the attack by the  Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 many of the Magic Knights  had their bodies taken over
 and contributed to the  destruction of this kingdom.
 They're absolutely unforgivable!
 You're exactly right.
 The Magic Knights only defend each other.
 We mean nothing to them!
 Let's show them the true meaning of justice!
 Of course.
 We're standing up for the  rights of our fellow citizens,
 and to regain peace and  harmony in this kingdom.
 Now... In order to exact our justice,
 let us execute these two servants  of the devil immediately.
 Agreed!
 We'll put their corpses on  display and show the world
 the Magic Knights' negligence,  arrogance, and deceit!
 There's no future in this kingdom for  the Magic Knights who aid the devils!
 Exactly! From now on, we will be the ones
 who maintain the peace and  tranquility of the Clover Kingdom!
 I think we should hold off on the executions.
 How can you say that right now?!
 I feel exactly the same way as all of you.
 I cannot forgive anyone  who sides with the devil.
 But if we hang on to those two,
 we'll be able to lure out the  devil-possessed boy, Asta.
 Wouldn't the masses side more with
 Master Kabwe if we disposed  of all three of them at once?
 True. If we use them as bait,  the Black Bulls should act.
 Asta the Devil-Possessed...  He's who we're really after.
 True...
 We might as well call Asta a devil himself.
 We cannot exact justice until we execute him.
 Yes, you're exactly right.
 Now, let us figure out a way to capture Asta.
 Let me think...
 They stopped moving.
 There's no one here?
 In there.
 Marie!
 We've come to save you! Answer me!
 This is...
 They put one over on us.
 Then Nero and Marie are...
 Damn it!
 We'll regroup with Yami and Gordon  and return to the royal capital for now.
 We need to rethink our plan.
 It'll be okay.
 Do you think this will all work out?
 Everything's been working out  for us ever since that day.
 It's all thanks to you, Bow.
 No, it's not.
 If I hadn't met you, my life wouldn't  be going anywhere right now.
 If I didn't have you,
 I would've felt nothing but despair  at everything in this world.
 You can do it. Because you're my hope.
 I'm sure this will all work  out with you by my side, Bow.
 What? Where am I?
 Are you awake?
 This is a breakroom in the palace.
 Owen...
 That's right! Nero was...
 Hey, wait!
 You need to confirm what's going on  before you go runnin' off like that, kid.
 Yes, sir!
 I managed to rid your body of the drug  they used on you, so you can go now.
 Thank you!
 So those guys called the Devil  Panickers took Nero and Marie?
 The Devil Banishers. You were  almost taken yourself.
 You saved me, didn't you?  Thanks a bunch, Noelle!
 I-It's not like I was trying to save you.
 It's just that those weirdos were  doing something that seemed odd...
 But I wasn't able to protect Nero.
 That's not your fault! It's because I  wasn't strong enough that Nero was...
 There's no point in talking about that now.
 Since we got Owen's okay,  you guys head back to the hideout.
 No! I'm going out to look for them right now!
 Didn't you hear a word we just said?
 We don't have any clues right now,  so we have no way of finding them.
 That's right!
 I'm counting on you.
 Where are you going, Yami?
 A captain's gotta do his  captainly duties sometimes.
 Oh, yeah.
 I already warned him myself,
 but if Gauche decides to freak out,  use force if necessary to stop him.
 I don't care how, as long as  he's still breathing some. Got it?
 Okay...
 Everyone is here.
 The Golden Dawn and Aqua Deer  are securing our borders.
 The Coral Peacocks and Purple Orcas
 are aiding in the restoration  of high-priority locations.
 We can't just abandon those duties right now.
 So if we can solve this with everyone  who's here right now, it'd be for the best.
 There's something I'd like to say first.
 There is a high likelihood that my  subordinates orchestrated this whole thing.
 And because of that, I will  offer you any information I can.
 Are you all okay with that?
 Our top priority right now is to  take back the two who were taken.
 We can investigate your  subordinates' involvement later.
 Yes, you're right.
 Chairman Damnatio, if you would fill us in.
 The first is Kabwe Carillon, 38 years old.
 He uses transparency magic that allows  him and those around him to disappear.
 But unlike the former Captain of the  Purple Orcas, he cannot conceal his mana.
 The second is Onoby Sinho, 31 years old.
 He uses barrier magic that allows him to
 put up a barrier with a radius  about five times his height.
 If anyone tries to forcefully destroy  this barrier, it will explode.
 The third is Siona Caverly, 29 years old.
 She is a paper magic user who  can control any thickness
 and length of paper at will.
 None of them sound like  they're worth slicing up.
 We don't know for sure if they're involved  with the Devil Banishers just yet.
 Once we get proof they're involved,  you can slice them up all you want,
 but for now, help us figure out how we're  gonna save those girls, Beanpole Monster.
 The Black Bull who has been captured  possesses arcane stage magic.
 Since she stands a chance against the devil, she is key in our strategy to fight it.
 We cannot lose her.
 The other captive is also an  important citizen of this kingdom.
 We must get her back unharmed.
 Great thing to say, Prickly Queen.
 You're way smarter than  a certain beanpole we know.
 Shut up.
 Yami praised me! Wait, now's not  the time to be happy about that.
 Even if it was an ambush, it's hard to believe
 that Asta would let someone who's  not a fighter get the best of him.
 Well, they used a method he's  never had to deal with before.
 They used a sleeping potion on Asta.
 Well, that's pretty dirty.
 Our kid's trained, so he can dispel  any spells if he's attacked by magic
 and smack anyone back if  they physically hit him.
 So basically, he's only fought people  face-to-face up until now, so that was fine.
 It would appear they have someone  rather intelligent in their ranks.
 There is also the fact that they  used that magic item against us.
 So those guys call themselves  the Devil Banishers.
 They want to get rid of the devil, don't they?
 Yes.
 So why haven't they offed their captives  already? I'm sure they've had the chance.
 If we assume my subordinates are  indeed involved in this matter...
 Among the three, Kabwe has an  extremely strong sense of justice,
 and after the incident with  the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 he grew to hate the devil even more.
 He was quite exasperated  that the execution of the
 devil-possessed had been delayed.
 Then wouldn't he kill them even quicker?
 Why would they bother wasting  time with sleeping potions?
 I'm sure they had their reasons.
 Like what?
 If Kabwe is leading them,
 he would much prefer this be an actual  execution rather than an assassination.
 I'm sure he will try to take  their lives in front of
 the masses in the name of justice.
 So that he can gain the approval of the masses  and justify his own brand of justice.
 So he fancies himself a revolutionary.
 That seems like a rather effective  way to carry out their goal.
 Tch. Man, these assholes are a pain.
 But going with that assumption, it's very  likely the captives are still alive.
 Yeah.
 If they actually carried out  a public execution...
 I'm sure there are citizens who  would agree with their justice.
 Even I have seen those who are unhappy  with this kingdom's governance
 ever since the attack by the  Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 The wounds from that attack have yet to heal.
 People still remember how  fearsome the devil was.
 If this keeps going, there might be an  uprising caused by a large group of rebels.
 We must prepare for the imminent threat  from outside our kingdom right now,
 so we need to do everything  we can to avoid conflict within.
 That's just another reason we need  to put an end to their schemes.
 If they're going to go through  with this public execution,
 they will appear before us.
 What's important is what we do then.
 Yes. I'd like you all to proceed with caution.
 There's still something off about all of this.
 It feels like we might be overlooking something.
 The City of Lehart
 At noon today, we will be executing two of the devil's servants
 Execution?! Like hell I'm  ever gonna let that happen!
 I'll personally send anyone  who scares Marie to hell!

145,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 He puts in blood, sweat, and tears  in hopes of becoming the Wizard King.
 But there are also those in the kingdom  who possess at least a little bit of mana,
 yet can barely use any magic at all.
 The very few out of the population,  those who live in the shadows...
 They are also trying to survive.
 Where am I? What am I doing here?
 That's right! I—
 I see you're awake.
 You're... one of Asta and  Big Brother's friends.
 Yes.
 Though I wish we could escape,  our mana has been sealed.
 The magic item I borrowed from Asta to let  people know of our location is gone, too.
 Where are we? Who are those people?
 The only thing we have in common is that
 we were suspected of being servants  of the devil at the trial.
 They're probably trying to take  advantage of that somehow.
 This is all for the sake of justice.
 Indeed, Master Kabwe.
 We must rid this world of the devil's  servants who brought destruction
 and chaos to this kingdom.
 No matter what it takes.
 Rescue
 The City of Lehart
 There are so many people.
 The Devil Banishers are the bringers  of justice we've been waiting for!
 Bring death to servants of the devil!
 Yeah!
 Let there be blood!
 I can't wait!
 This is...
 How dare they do that to  my angel?! I'll kill them all!
 Damn. Looks like they're having fun.
 I-I'm scared...
 Nero, Marie, we're here to save you!
 We've got a message from Julius, guys.
 Looks like all the squads are ready.
 It's almost noon,
 when the Devil Banishers said  they'd execute them.
 We don't know how many  enemies we're dealing with,
 and we expect them to use  various drugs as well as magic.
 This will probably prove difficult,
 but I'd like you to do everything  you can to save the captured.
 First, the Silver Eagles  and the Crimson Lion Kings
 will help with the rescue and protect  the civilians who have gathered.
 The Blue Rose Knights and the Green  Praying Mantises will patrol the square.
 And the core squad that will save the  hostages will be the Black Bulls.
 You got it. By the way,
 there seems to be someone here who  has nothing to do with the plan.
 He may be here because he feels some guilt,
 considering his subordinates are behind this,
 but we can't just have him acting on his own.
 The rescue is our primary objective.
 Are you willing to go along with our plan?
 That was my intention.
 But I'd like to confirm something.
 If Asta uses the powers of the  devil in front of the masses,
 he will only bring more confusion and chaos.
 I ask that...
 He not use it for this plan, right?
 No shit.
 Listen up, dumbasses.
 Everyone other than the kid and Gauche,  keep an eye on the square like we planned.
 The lives of two of our own are  at stake. Don't let your guard down!
 Right!
 I'm counting on all of you.
 As you requested, we are having the other  squads keep an eye on the Noble Realm.
 Well, we must consider that  the execution could be
 a ruse to distract us while  they wreak havoc elsewhere.
 We must make sure this plan is  a success, to ensure this incident
 doesn't cause greater panic  among the masses.
 Yes. Let's have faith in everyone.
 So far, we haven't seen anything unusual.  I hope they're able to rescue them safely.
 Since Captain Vangeance is away  keeping an eye on the border,
 we aren't able to assist in  the main part of this plan.
 But be alert for even the smallest detail!
 Right.
 Ugh, why are we on patrol duty?
 You'd be able to beat up any enemy in a flash!
 I'm just here to complete my mission.
 Hey, wait for me!
 It's almost time! The purveyors  of justice will soon arrive!
 We can't count on the Magic Parliament  or the Magic Knights!
 Our true saviors are the Devil Banishers!
 That's right!
 Let justice be served!
 Those guys are probably  somewhere in this crowd, too.
 How are we supposed to find them, though?
 Yeah, they've all lost their minds.
 Did they use some kind  of weird drug on them all?
 Tch. I can't just sit here!
 Captain Yami, let me go down there!
 Me, too!
 Shut up!
 You're gonna ruin the plan  if you go down there!
 But we can't just sit here!
 You're the cornerstone of this plan, kid.
 So just sit and wait your damn turn.
 Okay...
 There's still no sign of them, but...
 It's almost noon.
 Sis, I don't see anyone suspicious.
 Don't let your guard down.
 You've got it, Sis.
 It's finally time.
 Witch...
 If you want your friends to live,  you will do as we say.
 Do anything rash, and we will kill your  friends before the public execution.
 Walk toward the exit.
 I knew this was mentioned,  but I really didn't sense their mana.
 It'll be okay. I'm sure the others  will be able to save Nero and Marie.
 All right.
 Here they come.
 To all who despise the devil...
 The time to strike in the  name of justice as arrived.
 We are the Devil Banishers!
 We are the ones who wish for the devil's demise!
 Marie!
 Nero!
 Calm your asses down.
 So it does appear that they can prevent  their mana from being detected.
 Looks like the only ones using  the items are those three.
 Behold this woman's horns!
 This is solid proof that she sold her soul  to the devil and used forbidden magic.
 How mortifying.
 She's the devil herself.
 The little girl next to her became a servant  of the devil along with her brother,
 who is a former criminal.
 We know it's the undeniable truth  that they have harmed many!
 Look at that innocent, harmless expression!
 Just execute them already!
 Let us have our justice!
 She should've been executed before!
 L-Lord Damnatio, if that  barrier spell explodes,
 many civilians will be harmed.
 Kabwe... Does your justice involve  risking the lives of innocent people?
 That spell is probably the work  of Mole Chin Scales' subordinates.
 But we mustn't forget that
 there is one possessed by the devil whom we must hate even more than these two.
 His name is...
 Asta!
 Asta, our greatest desire  is to see you executed!
 You are the true cause of this chaos!
 We know you're here.
 Asta?!
 It's just like Mister Yami said.
 I saw him in the papers!
 That peasant is here?!
 Like they'd stop any of this  if Asta did come forward.
 If you show yourself and  allow us to detain you,
 we will let these two go.
 Nero! Marie!
 What's the matter, Asta?
 Is your life more precious  than your friends' after all?
 Of course it is!
 You evil servant of the devil!
 There's no way Asta would  abandon his friends!
 Very well. If you refuse to show yourself...
 I'm right here!
 Now, come here.
 I don't see Vanessa, but we don't  have time to find her right now.
 You accursed devil-possessed!
 Everyone, he's the one who  messed up this country!
 How dare you ruin my family?!
 Kill him!
 Execute him!
 We don't serve the devil!
 Shut up, you devil!
 Halt.
 Give them your grimoire.
 Did that ruin your plans?
 We know that you hope to undo  the barrier with your anti-magic.
 What's the matter?
 Hurry up and give it to him!
 You're gonna free Nero and Marie, right?
 Yes. We already established that.
 Then put down your swords  and step away from them.
 Very well.
 Now, give us your grimoire.
 All right.
 Wha—
 There's...
 another Asta?!
 We were waiting for you to  look away from the hostages!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!
 Th-That was so scary!
 Sleeping potion...
 That's not gonna work anymore!
 Paper Magic: Dagger-Folding  Early Summer Rain!
 Nero! Marie!
 Not happening!
 There!
 Hup.
 Sis!
 Let's go!
 Things are getting interesting.
 Save me!
 Our comrades will buy us some time.
 Transparency Magic: Share the Same Fate!
 Nero! Marie!
 Hold it!
 You're in the way. Move!
 Kid, where are ya?!
 A drug?
 Water Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!
 What's going on? My magic control is...
 It's closing in!
 Finral! Where's Marie?
 Asta went after her.
 I was going to chase after them,
 but this smoke is affecting  my sight, and my magic is...
 The trap spells I set up throughout  the square aren't responding.
 Looks like there's something in  this smoke that disrupts mana.
 Those dirty little...
 Way to go, Mister Yami!  The smoke's no match for him!
 Go help evacuate the masses.
 On your knees.
 Begone!
 They're gone...
 Where are you taking me?
 Nowhere.
 Our mission was to get you away from  the square since you have magic
 that can change fate in your favor.
 I see... But even without changing fate,
 I know my friends have rescued the hostages.
 I guess I don't have to listen to you anymore.
 We know we can't defeat you.
 We also know they'll read our  memories if we're captured.
 Our job is done.
 We're willing to risk our lives for this plan.
 No... They just took their own lives.
 This plan is that important to them?
 I can feel their ki over here.
 You're finished.
 You followed us without realizing  that we wanted you to come.
 Put your grimoire here.
 If you resist, these girls will die.
 Asta...
 Don't worry. I'll save you.
 What could you possibly do  without the powers of the devil?
 Now, Master Kabwe, let's take  them before the others arrive.
 No, we'll take care of them here.
 B-But that's not according to plan.
 The Magic Knights are far more  powerful than I anticipated.
 We were lucky everything went well so far,
 but if we want to succeed,  our only chance is now.
 B-But...
 You coward! Why are you so scared?
 Wha—
 You'll pay for your insolence!
 Y-You bastard!
 Nero!
 You accursed devil-possessed!
 If you dodge, these will hit the little girl!
 Paper Magic: Dagger-Folding  Early Summer Rain!
 What?
 So you must be the Devil Banishers.
 Yuno?! What are you doing here?
 We just happened to be patrolling  the area and wandered by.
 Pure coincidence.
 This is slightly outside of our mission,  but Captain Vangeance did say to patrol.
 Are you all right, Asta?!
 Yeah. But more importantly,  take care of Nero.
 How dare you?!
 We almost got our hands on Asta!
 We can't get caught here.
 Give Nero back!
 Come any closer and the girl dies.
 Uh, wait. You're running away?
 You can't be serious.
 A devil resides in the  five-leaf-clover grimoire...
 We'll be taking this.
 Hold it!
 Asta...
 Damn it!
 Asta!
 Asta!
 Mimosa, check on Marie.
 Right!
 They stole his grimoire...  How vile could they be?
 You still have magic you can use even  if they take your grimoire, right?
 Yuno?
 What are you...
 Yeah.
 Not giving up is my magic!
 I'm gonna get Nero and my grimoire back!
 Marie!
 Don't die, Marie!
 It's too soon for you to become a real angel!
 Don't leave me behind!
 According to Owen, she'll need a  little more time before she wakes up.
 So Marie's okay?!
 Yes.
 I see...
 Looks like I owe you again.
 Today, it became clear that my subordinates  are involved in this matter.
 First, let me apologize for  my lack of supervision.
 You said they had a strong sense of justice,
 but they took the crowd hostage.  That's nothing more than playing dirty.
 Perhaps he's being fooled and  manipulated by the enemy?
 Stealing Asta's grimoire could  be someone else's intent, too.
 You're here at this meeting now,  but you weren't here earlier, were you?
 After you cried and swore your  loyalty to the boss, too.
 Sorry, Yami. I'm the one who  asked him to watch the borders.
 The worst thing that could happen right now  is for the Spade Kingdom to make a move.
 Everyone, please look at this.
 Looking through the memories of  the Devil Banishers we captured
 tells us that most of them were paid hires.
 I apologize for interrupting,  but this is urgent.
 What's going on?
 W-Well, we received a message from Kabwe.
 What?
 Kabwe?
 Where are you?
 They... aren't after the demise of the devil.
 They're actually... trying to  gain the powers of the devil.
 What?
 They are those who worship the devil...
 The Devil Believers!
 Thank goodness you're  all right, my angel Marie!
 But this isn't over!

 Rewinding the clock a tad...
 Curse you, Magic Knights.
 How is she doing?
 She appears to have some cracked ribs.
 Shall I prepare some pain medication?
 Please.
 Here you go.
 Thank you.
 Drink, Siona.
 The pain should eventually subside.
 Okay.
 What shall we do now?
 Master Kabwe?
 What are you doing?
 I'm going to kill her.
 Please wait! We have more important  things to worry about right now!
 No... Now is the time.  We must do this for Siona, too.
 Do what?
 They say that the devil dwells  in the five-leaf clover.
 Let us throw it away. It's a terrible omen.
 Master Kabwe!
 Why are you trying to stop me?  This wretched thing...
 is of no use to us any longer!
 Wait.
 I don't care what you do to me.
 Please, just give that back to Asta.
 How admirable.
 But I would never listen to anyone  who uses forbidden magic.
 Siona, what's wrong?!
 Siona!
 What is...
 Wha—
 Onoby!
 No...
 Did you...
 Why?
 You still don't understand?
 We do not wish for the devil's demise.
 We are the Devil Believers.
 We worship the devil.
 Worship? What are you saying?
 Didn't you turn to us because  you wanted to destroy the devil?
 We didn't turn to you.
 We just wanted to take advantage  of your hatred toward the devil.
 Take advantage of us?
 To get information that you,  a Magic Parliament member,
 could attain that we mere peasants could not.
 And we needed someone who could use  magic to deal with the Magic Knights.
 Someone who could use magic?
 What do you mean?
 Yes, I'd imagine that you can't even fathom...
 how it feels to be like us,  people who can barely use magic.
 On a hot summer day,
 the neighborhood kids asked  me to do something.
 They asked me to use my catalyst  magic to mix their magic together.
 We wanted to cool off that way.
 They seemed truly happy.
 Seeing their faces made me happy, too.
 But then I overheard them  talking behind my back,
 saying they were only acting like my friends
 because I didn't have any friends,  so that they could impress the adults.
 And because I could barely  use any magic, they said...
 She's so creepy.
 And they just laughed at me.
 There's no place for people who can  barely use magic in this kingdom.
 So that's it... You're...
 Correct. We basically don't exist.
 But that Asta boy...  despite having no magic at all...
 By using a grimoire with  a devil living inside it,
 he's able to use powers equal  to those who can use magic.
 If we could also obtain  the devil's powers, like him...
 I will never allow that to happen!
 Why, you...
 Let's go.
 Yes.
 I-I can't let it end like this...
 Kabwe?
 Where are you?
 They... aren't after the demise of the devil.
 They're actually... trying to  gain the powers of the devil.
 What?
 They are those who worship the devil...
 The Devil Believers!
 Chairman Damnatio... please forgive me.
 Please... stop them...
 What's wrong, Kabwe?
 Will you fill us in on the details?
 Those who worship the devil...  Devil Believers, eh?
 So your subordinates who  actually despised the devil...
 It's probably safe to assume  that they were being used.
 Those fools.
 I can understand if they wanted  to destroy them, but...
 Wanting to worship the devil?  Talk about a bunch of weirdos.
 Pardon me.
 It appears that communication  magic came from Tiulyu.
 Tiulyu?!
 Julius!
 I hereby order the Black Bulls
 to capture the Devil Believers and save Nero.
 You got it.
 He must've used the last of his strength
 to contact his former boss.
 Do you think they argued and disbanded?
 Probably not.
 There's no sign of a struggle.
 Then these people...
 Just like Mole Chin Scales said,
 they were probably being used  by those Devil Whatever guys.
 Captain.
 You're scary, man.
 A venomless viper...
 Powdered long-necked softshell turtle,  and the root of a gorikabuto plant...
 These are all extremely hard to come by.
 Which means...
 The potion that put my  best friend Asta to sleep,
 as well as the various potions  used at the execution site,
 were definitely made here.
 I'd love to get more information  on the person who lives here,
 but the villagers are definitely wary of us.
 Please leave it to me.
 I'm here, Granny Maggie.
 My, my. And you've brought your friends.
 This is Granny Maggie. We became  friends the last time we visited.
 Oh, hey.
 It's nice to meet you! My name is Asta!
 You're way too loud!
 So are you.
 Oh? The mean-looking boy who  called me an angel isn't with you?
 Angel?
 Oh, if you mean my best friend Gauche,
 he's back at the royal capital  watching over his little sister.
 So he must've found his sister.
 Yes.
 I can see you two are reminiscing  and all, but you got a second, granny?
 It's about someone who lives in  the forest on the outskirts of town.
 You mean Bow?
 Could you tell us everything  you know about this Bow person?
 Sure...
 But next time you come around,  bring that Gauche fellow with you.
 Uh, sure.
 She can barely use magic?
 You probably wouldn't know, but there  are a bunch of people like that.
 You can't really blame her.
 Not only can everyone in her family use magic,
 we have a guy who goes above and beyond  and can't use any magic at all.
 This is all your fault.
 Me?!
 But...
 Bow is an expert apothecary.
 In this town, we don't go to  a doctor for recovery magic.
 We go to Bow for the medicine she makes.
 I could tell by looking at her shelves.
 I heard she worked really hard.
 She was probably able to become  an expert apothecary
 precisely because she  couldn't use magic much.
 Sounds like a certain meathead I know.
 Huh?
 Come to think of it, Bow's friend Dazu...
 She lost her husband and mother-in-law
 the night those devil  servants attacked the town.
 Where's her house?
 Just like Bow, Dazu also can't really use magic.
 But she never let that get her down.  She's truly a wonderful girl.
 She got along very well with her husband,  Vide, and they seemed very happy.
 Her mother-in-law, Meshu, always spoke of  what a wonderful daughter-in-law she was.
 Yami!
 I need you to see this!
 This woman...
 Now I get it.
 Isn't it weird?
 Huh?
 That old lady said Dazu seemed truly happy,
 but does she look happy to you?
 Hang on.
 Why would someone whose  family was killed by the devil
 be one of the guys who worships the devil?
 All right.
 Continue your search for the Devil Believers.
 Got it.
 Just one thing, Julius...
 Yes?
 I know you want us to go after them,
 but it seems pointless to  wander around aimlessly.
 True.
 I'm sure the Devil Believers approached Kabwe  and the other Magic Parliament members
 in hopes of getting information.
 If that's the case, they must've gotten word
 that the devil called Megicula  is in the Spade Kingdom.
 So basically, they want to  hand Nero off as a gift.
 Oh, yeah. They have the kid's grimoire, too.
 My grimoire's an afterthought?!
 I'm guessing they originally wanted to  offer you up with the grimoire, too.
 And then they want to join the Spade Kingdom... or rather, join with the devil.
 But why?
 We probably won't know until  we ask them personally.
 In any case,
 it's likely the Devil Believers  are trying to cross
 the borders beyond the Forsaken  Realm to get to the Spade Kingdom.
 Yami, I'm counting on you.
 Sure.
 We've got work to do, dumbasses!
 Right!
 A mission?
 Yeah.
 I refuse.
 You're refusing a mission?
 I'm sure Marie will be disappointed in you.
 Old hag?
 What the hell are you doing here?
 Why am I here?
 To take Marie back from her good-for-nothing  brother who's obsessed with her.
 What?! You're trying to take my angel?
 This time, I can guarantee Marie's safety.
 Now go and get to work.
 Shut your mouth, old hag!  My only job is to watch over Marie.
 And you think that'll make Marie happy?
 Besides, it's your job as a  Magic Knight to protect everyone.
 I'm really proud that you're a Magic Knight!
 Please just be the cool  big brother I'm proud of!
 Tch. Fine. I'll listen to you just this once.
 But don't you dare put Marie in danger again!
 Get your ass over here!
 I won't.
 And so, the Black Bulls began
 their pursuit of the Devil Believers,  who disappeared into the Forsaken Realm.
 To go along with that, other squads  searched the Common Realm just in case.
 But no matter how hard they searched,  they had no luck finding the Devil Believers,
 and several days passed.
 Either there's some really cheery  asshole in the Forsaken Realm,
 or we just can't find any of  them with mana tracking.
 They might be using something to  prevent their mana from being tracked.
 We haven't gotten any notable  information over here, either.
 I'm assuming the Devil Believers  got through the Forsaken Realm
 and are trying to get to the Spade Kingdom.
 Yeah, I know.
 There are signs that they traveled  through the Forsaken Realm.
 Signs?
 Yeah. Something weird's going on.
 Looks like that village had a  bunch of people disappear, too.
 Why is that happening everywhere we go?
 Do you think the Devil Whatevers are behind it?
 You would think so.
 Hey, I wanna ask you guys something.
 Why the hell's everyone avoiding us so much?
 Probably because of what happened  with the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Huh?
 For the people out in the Forsaken Realm,
 not only did the Magic Knights  do nothing to help them,
 but some of them even believe that  Magic Knights were behind the attacks.
 I'll do what I want!
 Don't try to stop me!
 No, don't go!
 I'm late meeting up with them  because you keep trying to stop me!
 Everyone else already left!
 Healing your leg with the devil's powers?
 That's absolutely absurd!  How can I believe that?
 Of course you can believe it!
 There's even a guy who  got into the Magic Knights
 even though he doesn't have any magic,  because of the devil's powers!
 But that boy was put on trial because of that.
 So what?!
 You don't need to be scared of any  trials if you have the devil's powers!
 Get off me!
 Someone stop him! Please!
 Hey, hold it!
 Are you worrying your mother again?
 Let go of me! I have to go!
 They're all waiting for  me right outside of town!
 Yup. We're heading to the  border now from Hecairo.
 There are two big rivers that flow  into each other there, right?
 Yeah.
 No one's here.
 No...
 It looks like they were definitely here.
 You still letting what that kid said bug you?
 Oh, come on. Do I look like it's bugging me?
 Yes.
 Well, how do I put this?
 I'm sure he's struggling hard to cure his leg.
 There's no doubt that the Devil Believers
 are becoming a ray of  hope for people like him.
 That just means there are people out  there who have nowhere else to turn,
 so they feel like they have to rely on the devil.
 But anyway... We've gotta  do something about them.
 The strong magic region just beyond Breed  Mountain on the way to the Spade Kingdom
 gets pretty intense waves. They're  probably waiting for it to calm down.
 I see.
 I'll send backup right over.
 You guys need to catch up to them  before they reach the border.
 Got it?
 Right!
 Nero...
 Whoa!
 Magna, try to fly this thing steady!
 You can't be serious!
 It's gonna be difficult to catch  up to them if they managed to
 get through Breed Mountain in this weather.
 Hey, what's that?
 H-How are there so many of them?!
 We finally caught up with them!
 They really are heading to the Spade Kingdom!

 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 He puts in blood, sweat, and tears  in hopes of becoming the Wizard King.
 But there are also those in the kingdom  who possess at least a little bit of mana,
 yet can barely use any magic at all.
 The very few out of the population,  those who live in the shadows...
 They are also trying to survive.
 The group led by Dazu Tayak and Bow Nocde
 were not actually those who wished for  the devil's demise, the Devil Banishers,
 but those who worshiped  the devil, the Devil Believers.
 After revealing themselves,  the Devil Believers
 murdered Kabwe and the others from the  Magic Parliament that they were manipulating,
 then disappeared, taking Asta's  grimoire and Nero with them.
 So basically, they want to  hand Nero off as a gift.
 Oh, yeah. They have the kid's grimoire, too.
 And then they want to join the Spade Kingdom... or rather, join with the devil.
 Yami, I'm counting on you.
 Asta and the other Black Bulls began  their pursuit of the Devil Believers.
 It's gonna be difficult to catch  up to them if they managed to
 get through Breed Mountain in this weather.
 Hey, what's that?
 And they were finally able  to catch up to them, but...
 H-How are there so many of them?!
 Prepared to Die
 Isn't it beautiful?
 Huh?
 The sunset.
 Yes... I didn't even notice it.
 It sets instantly, but still manages to  shine so brilliantly for that moment.
 Doesn't it make your heart feel at peace?
 Yes.
 Um, you're Bow, aren't you?
 Bow Nocde, who lives in the forest  on the outskirts of town.
 You've heard of me?
 Um, my husband's mother mentioned you before.
 Did she tell you to steer clear  of the weird lady there
 who uses strange medicines?
 No, not at all.
 Are you going to use that  in one of your medicines?
 Yes.
 Wow, that's amazing.
 Amazing?
 Well, most people in this kingdom  can do everything with magic.
 Where did you learn how to  make medicine like that?
 Nowhere, really.
 Huh?
 I figured out the ingredients, mixed them,
 failed many times,  and just kept trying again.
 All on your own?
 This is about all I can do,  since I can barely use any magic.
 Well, if you'll excuse me.
 U-Um, I'm Dazu!
 Dazu Tayak!
 Um, do you mind if I visit you sometime?
 Sure. I would love to see you, Dazu.
 I'll brew some bitter medicine for you.
 Your bombs are always impressive.
 Now we can move forward.
 Let us hurry. It will be dark soon.
 We need to get through Breed Mountain  and past the border as fast as possible.
 Once we do, we'll be out of the  Clover Kingdom's jurisdiction.
 Then even the Magic Knights  won't be able to capture us.
 And we'll go to the Spade Kingdom.
 Impossible.
 Even if you get past the border,
 there's a strong magic region that  lies before the Spade Kingdom.
 The Spade Kingdom is a country  filled with snow and mysteries.
 Between it and the Clover Kingdom is  a neutral zone belonging to no nation,
 most of which is a strong magic region.
 Strong magic regions are designated areas  that possess a powerful force field of mana,
 which causes various magical phenomena that  seem to prevent anyone from entering.
 Extreme natural conditions, swirling mana,  and treacherous mountains...
 Getting through a strong magic region  is perilous even for Magic Knights.
 Meaning all of you who lack mana...
 Yes.
 You are correct.
 Do you plan to die?
 Die? Yes, we might die.
 But if we have any chance of getting there...
 Let's go.
 Yes.
 Mister Yami, can you hear me?  It's me, Magna! You there?!
 We found the Devil Believers,  but there are a whole lot of them!
 We're awaiting your orders!
 Mister Yami! Mister Yami!
 The mana in this area is pretty messy, too.
 The strong magic region  beyond the border might be
 disrupting communication here, too.
 Asta, Lady Noe, I'm gonna go  somewhere I can get some reception
 and ask Mister Yami for instructions.
 You guys stand by here.
 I'll be back with reinforcements soon.  Don't move from here!
 Let's haul ass, Crazy Cyclone!
 Uh, hey, wait! Jeez...
 Wait here? It's cold!  We'll get soaked and end up sick!
 Though you're probably too stupid  to ever get sick, Stupidsta.
 Hang on a second!
 He just told us to stay put!
 Well, I'm worried about Nero!
 I want to save Nero as soon as possible, too.
 But how?
 Do we just try to scatter the enemy?
 No!
 Then what?
 I'm gonna go talk to them again.
 We should be able to understand each other.
 If we could talk this over,  we wouldn't be in this mess in the first—
 Nero...
 Ugh, you're hopeless. You know that?
 Come on.
 I'll let you hold on.
 You'd better be grateful.
 Thanks, Noelle!
 H-Hmph! You owe me one!
 Hey, are you okay?
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 Here, grab on.
 Thanks.
 I can't stop shaking.
 It's even colder now that  the sun's going down.
 But let's do our best.
 Thinking back on everything I've  been through, this is nothing!
 Thinking back on everything I've  been through, this is nothing...
 Exactly.
 It's beautiful.
 It's just like back then.
 It's a full moon.
 The mana in the strong magic  region may weaken a little.
 The chance of that might be low,  but there's still a chance.
 And because of chance,
 I was able to meet you,  Bow, and live until today.
 I made it through so many trials  and hardships because of you.
 I'm eternally grateful.
 So am I. And we finally made it this far.
 But we still have a long journey ahead.
 Let's continue working together.
 Just the two of us.
 Hey, what's that?
 Could it be...
 Is it...
 Asta!
 Asta!
 We finally caught up to you guys!
 Nero, where are you?!
 These people...
 Stupidsta, you probably haven't noticed,
 but I can barely sense any  mana from these people.
 Huh?
 Just like the boy from that village.
 He had small, fleeting mana.
 There are that many people in this  kingdom who can hardly use magic?
 No, that's not it.
 This is just some of them.
 Found her.
 Nero! We're here to get you!
 Wait, Stupidsta, be careful!
 I'll be fine! With the wind this strong,
 sleep potions or any other  potions will just blow away!
 Yeah, but...
 Should we really attack these people
 when we're supposed to be  protecting them as Magic Knights?
 But right now, I have to protect Asta!
 What?
 Master Asta! Master Asta!  Master Asta! Master Asta!
 Yes, the one bestowed with the devil's powers!
 The Devil Believers...
 Those who worship the devil.
 Master Asta! Master Asta! Master Asta!
 You're their leader, Dazu Tayak, right?
 Asta...
 And Bow Nocde.
 Let Nero go. Nero's a very  important friend of ours.
 Asta...
 You're taking Nero and my grimoire as  gifts to join the Spade Kingdom, right?
 And if you could,  you'd probably want to take me.
 I see you've figured out our plan.
 Then you should know...
 ...that we can't return Nero to you.
 Once you get beyond these mountains,  we'll be on neutral ground.
 There's a strong magic region there, but tonight's a full moon,
 so the mana will be weakened.
 You're probably trying to get  through the strong magic region now.
 But with your numbers and  equipment, that's impossible!
 We know that.
 But still, I... we are going to go.
 I barely have any mana.
 I can't really use magic.
 Magic is everything here in the Clover  Kingdom, so I basically didn't exist.
 Even my own parents looked down on me.  I was laughed at in school.
 My teachers mocked me.
 I couldn't make friends, and everyone in  town always gave me judgmental looks.
 Asta, I'm sure you understand.
 Yeah.
 That's why I worked much harder  than the average person.
 And yet I was mocked and looked down upon  just because I couldn't use much magic.
 But... your husband still  accepted you, didn't he?!
 Accepted me?
 Granny Maggie from Tiulyu said that
 your mother-in-law was really happy  about her son's wonderful wife.
 Doesn't that prove that your husband  and mother-in-law both accepted you?
 You must've been happy even  if you couldn't use magic!
 I wasn't happy at all!
 I knew the truth...
 But maybe they could've...
 No, they're all the same.
 Every day with those people
 was hell for me.
 They would always smile kindly,  tell me my cooking was delicious,
 and praise my hard work.
 Then...
 I'm sure our neighbors also thought  of my husband and mother-in-law
 as kind, charitable people.
 But they mocked me.
 They looked down on me.
 They didn't accept me at all.
 They were just using me!
 They enjoyed making fun of me.
 They were relieved that there was  someone lower than themselves!
 They were trash!
 They deserved to die!
 Dazu...
 I'm sorry. I just...
 Though our situations are different,  everyone here led lives similar to ours.
 All of you?
 I can make many medicines and  potions that work far better
 than the magic of an average recovery mage.
 But they didn't accept me, solely  because I couldn't use magic much.
 There were a few people who  relied on me every now and then,
 but once they had what they wanted,  they were done with me.
 The same goes for me!
 While those fools were out playing,  I spent sleepless nights studying.
 You have no idea how hard  I worked to survive!
 Me, too!
 Me, too!
 Me, too!
 Me, too!
 Me, too!
 M-Me, too!
 We all did!
 They mocked us just because  we couldn't use magic well!
 They acted like we didn't exist!
 I'm done with that!
 We're leaving this stupid kingdom!
 Look at these people.
 We met them on our way to the Spade Kingdom.
 They experienced the same hardships we did.
 They lived in the shadows. I'd never  imagined so many of us existed.
 To think that so many sympathized  with us and wanted to help us...
 Asta.
 Telling us to go back is telling us  to go back to a life of mockery!
 We've had enough!
 You understand, don't you?
 Yeah, I do.
 Asta...
 And it's because I understand  that I have to stop you guys!
 Why do you all want to go to  the Spade Kingdom so badly?
 To gain the powers of the devil.
 But that's...
 Kabwe from the Magic Parliament told us that  there was a devil in the Spade Kingdom,
 and that the devil would give us powers.
 I... We want power.
 After joining the Spade Kingdom  and gaining the devil's powers,
 we will come back to this kingdom someday...
 ...and have our revenge.
 No... But that's—
 The three leaves of the clover  represent faith, hope, and love.
 Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.
 Within a fifth leaf resides a devil.
 That's how the saying goes, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 Even though you had no mana  and couldn't use any magic,
 you gained the devil's powers  because of this grimoire.
 You joined the Magic Knights  and accomplished many things.
 We look up to you so much.
 You look up to me? But I don't...
 We want to be like you.
 We're going to the Spade Kingdom.
 We'll gain the devil's powers...
 ...and be reborn!
 Then we'll get revenge on this kingdom!
 That is our desire.
 But I'm different!
 Different?
 That's right! No matter how  hard I worked and trained,
 I was mocked for not being able to use magic.
 They looked down on me my whole life.
 But I never despised any of them!
 Yeah, I gained that grimoire  and the devil's powers,
 but I never once thought about using those  powers to take revenge on this kingdom!
 I worked for this kingdom!
 No matter how poor you are...  even if you're an orphan or a peasant...
 I just wanted everyone to be happy!
 I can't imagine how much  better off we would've been
 if we could actually think like that.
 Indeed.
 We cannot extinguish the blazing flames  of revenge that burn within our hearts.
 So we can't return Nero to you!
 We will continue on to the Spade Kingdom.
 All right. Then let Nero go!
 I just told you we can't...
 I'll take her place!
 What are you...
 Your original plan was to  take me, wasn't it? Right?
 My grimoire and I should be  more than enough for gifts!
 We'll have to restrain you.
 Sure!
 And her, too.
 Now, keep your promise. Let Nero go.
 All right, we will.
 After we take you to the Spade Kingdom.
 You're too naïve.
 No, I have faith in them.
 We want to obtain the devil's  powers no matter what.
 The more gifts we have, the better.
 Asta and his grimoire... The girl  who used forbidden magic, Nero...
 And now we have a royal girl.
 What wonderful gifts.
 If we make it through the  strong magic region, that is.
 Correct.
 Now, let us proceed.
 That's the border.
 We're almost to...
 ...the border.
 The strong magic region...
 I can feel it from here. There's so  much mana that's out of control.
 How do you intend to get through that?
 We can barely use magic.  We barely have any mana.
 But that also means we do  have a little bit of mana.
 Even if we don't have much magic,
 if I can pull all of our magic together with my catalyst magic,
 we can make it powerful.
 Just as a droplet of water can  become a powerful current.
 We'll use her catalyst magic to  pull all of our mana together
 and use that to protect ourselves  from the strong magic region's mana.
 But that's—
 Indeed. It won't be easy.
 The Spade Kingdom is far away.
 Who knows if your mana will  hold out until we get there?
 No, it's impossible.
 But at least one of us might make it there.
 And that one person might  attain the devil's powers.
 Then maybe... No, we must see this through.
 Or our revenge upon the  Clover Kingdom will never happen.
 No...
 Let's go.
 Yes.
 That's—
 Asta, Lady Noe, Nero!  Sorry to keep you guys waiting!
 Magna! Captain Yami!
 We are the Magic Knights.
 We protect this kingdom and its people.
 That is our duty!

 You made all these? That's amazing!
 It's really not a big deal.
 No, really. You're amazing, Bow!
 Thank you, Dazu.
 That's about all the magic I have.
 You really are amazing, Bow!
 Thanks for having me over.
 It was a pleasure.
 Well, see you...
 Right...
 Um...
 If you wouldn't mind...
 May I come over again?
 Would you come over again?
 Yes.
 There we go. All that's left is...
 Could you take over for a moment?
 And to finish it off... a pinch  of moguro leaf powder.
 Slower, gentler... Okay?
 All right...
 There we go.
 Now they won't get chapped so easily.
 Thank you, Bow.
 Here.
 I'll do it, too.
 There you go.
 Thank you, Dazu.
 What happened?
 They did this. They asked  to see my catalyst magic.
 They only wanted to see me fail and laugh at me.
 He almost looked worried  and asked, ""Are you okay?""
 But I know he was laughing on the inside.
 They're all like that. They're all the same.
 But you're different!
 And so are you.
 Ow...
 Endure it. It'll get better soon enough.
 Thank you.
 It's fine.
 Are you all right?
 Yes.
 I always thought I was alone.
 But I'm not alone.
 I lived in a world where the sun didn't shine.
 We were weak and fleeting...
 But we definitely existed.
 Becoming the Light That Shines Through the Darkness
 Breed Mountain
 Ugh, you're late!
 Wait, you mean our backup is...
 I was basically the fastest one to get here.
 Thanks!
 But damn...
 Who knew there were this many of them now?
 Heya, Devil Believers.
 Why don't we have a little chat?
 Chat?
 There's nothing to talk about.
 Aw, don't be like that.
 Is that a Magic Knights Squad captain?
 Does he want to capture us?
 But we're right at the border.
 N-No! I don't want to get caught!
 I'm going to the Spade Kingdom!
 Yeah!
 Let's go!
 You won't catch us!
 Let's all go to the Spade Kingdom!
 Hey, now... We didn't come to nab all of—
 We should hurry, too.
 Yes.
 Come on!
 Ow...
 Noelle!
 Nero!
 Hold it!
 It's no use.
 But...
 No matter. We still have the five-leaf grimoire.
 As long as we still have this...
 Captain Yami!
 Hold out your hands.
 Our hands?
 Mister Yami, shouldn't we stop them?
 No need to hurry.
 See? Here they come.
 Looks like two pretty little  birdies have arrived.
 Huh?
 Captain Fuegoleon!
 And the pleasantly plump spatial door guy!
 Nozel!
 Looks like we made it in time.
 Devil Believers...
 We would like all of you to listen to us!
 Why would we listen to Magic Knights?
 Everyone, send all of your mana to me!
 Concentrate!
 To Dazu!
 To Dazu!
 To Dazu!
 To Dazu!
 To Dazu!
 To Dazu!
 To Dazu!
 To Dazu!
 Looks like they're not going  to listen. That's not surprising.
 I'm sure they feel nothing but distrust for us.
 What?
 Come on, now...
 Her catalyst magic most likely affects  the mana in the surrounding area, too.
 And we're right next to a strong magic region.
 That must've summoned a  magic beast from there.
 Thanks for the explanation, bud.
 So...
 Now what?
 I had the power to summon that monster.
 If I have that much power...
 Dazu!
 Flame Magic: Exploding Fireball!
 You okay?!
 Y-Yes...
 Sealing Magic: Closed Sorrow.
 My wounds...
 They weren't after the grimoire?
 They came to save us?
 Flame Magic: Ignis Columna!
 Mercury Magic: Silver Bullets!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!
 Mercury Magic: Silver Shining Regal Spear!
 Flame Spirit Magic: Salamander's Breath!
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade!
 Well, that's that.
 Th-They're so strong...
 So these are...
 ...the Magic Knights?
 Even though... I collected  mana from so many of them...
 It's over...
 And we came so far.
 You saw how strong they are.
 We can't escape.
 What kind of punishment will we get?
 Guys...
 I think you've got the wrong idea here.
 We didn't come here to apprehend you.
 We just came to talk to you.
 Talk?
 Roger-dodger-roger!
 Hey, that's... Wait...
 Is he the Golden...
 ...Hero, William...
 ...Vangeance?!
 Those who live in the shadows...
 Heya, ""Hero.""
 Thanks for coming out this far.
 I'll do anything for this kingdom.
 That is my atonement.
 But you know...
 Did you have to show up  with Mister No Fun Scales?
 Arcane stage girl.
 I'm glad you're safe.
 We don't intend to punish you.
 It appears that you're heading  toward the Spade Kingdom,
 but you haven't crossed the border yet,
 which means you haven't  committed a crime yet.
 But...
 If we just asked you to go home  from here, I'm sure you'd refuse.
 We Magic Knights understand your situation.
 So please, could you give us a bit of time?
 We will try to get rid of your doubts.
 But...
 We can't trust them.
 Why would they care how we feel?
 They're all royalty and nobles...
 That's not—
 Well, as you can see,
 we do have some royal and noble  elites in the Magic Knights,
 but it's not as if we're all like that.
 I mean, my squad has a former convict,  someone who got kicked out of their home,
 a loner, a guy who was disowned by his family,
 someone who's been alone for a really long time,
 and we've even got some peasants.
 Also, I'm a foreigner.
 When I first drifted to this kingdom,
 I couldn't speak your language  and was totally ostracized.
 So I get where you guys are coming from.
 What pushed you over the edge
 are your differences and the  discrimination you've faced.
 We must apologize for how powerless  we've been to help you thus far.
 Nozel...
 I swear upon the House of Vermillion...
 I will do everything I can to rid this world  of these differences and discrimination.
 Please go back to your homes and wait  for the day we fulfill our promise.
 We will shine the light known  as hope upon the darkness.
 Lord Vangeance...
 Your face...
 I am the same as you.
 I have faced discrimination  because of this face.
 But the current Wizard King,  Julius Novachrono,
 did not care how I looked and took me in.
 He accepted me for who I was.
 He gave me a place to belong.
 Lord Julius saved me.
 And now, it's our turn.
 We will create a place for you to stay.
 A place where the sun shines.
 So please, once... Just once...
 I ask that you believe in us.
 The Magic Knights...
 If they're saying that they'll support us...
 Maybe just once...
 Yeah, just once...
 Let's believe in them.
 Yeah.
 Now, then.
 Dazu Tayak, Bow Nocde, and other  leaders of the Devil Believers.
 You are a separate matter.  You kidnapped two girls.
 Instigated a riot in the royal capital.
 And...
 Kabwe Carillon, Onoby Sinho,  and Siona Caverly of the Magic Parliament.
 You are suspected of killing those three.
 Well, you heard him.
 You must be judged.
 You have committed severe crimes.
 If we're just going to get  arrested and be punished...
 Then I'll blow you all away!
 Don't waste your time.
 But we came so far...
 Dazu...
 Dazu.
 Who said anything about arresting you?
 Arrest you and punish you?
 How naïve.
 I told you. I'm going to judge you.
 Therefore, you are hereby...
 exiled from this kingdom.
 Roger-dodger-roger!
 Leave the Clover Kingdom immediately.
 Dazu...
 We will decide
 where we go.
 No one can decide our path for us.
 Do as you please.
 Does that mean...
 Asta...
 That's my...
 H-Hey!
 I'm going to be the Wizard King someday.
 And as the Wizard King,  I want to create a free kingdom
 where everyone can understand  each other and laugh together.
 I promise you, so please...
 No matter where you go, even if it's from afar,
 please keep an eye on us.
 I wish...
 I could've been like you.
 I'm sorry. Please tell that little girl, Marie, as well.
 We have no grimoire and no hostages.
 We are the only ones left.
 The chances of us getting through
 the strong magic region and making  it to the Spade Kingdom are...
 But even so, I'm...
 Let's go.
 Right.
 Yes.
 We will go. We will leave  the Clover Kingdom. But...
 If this kingdom is unable to change...
 Someone else will take our place.
 They'll appear from the shadows, over and over.
 Bow...
 Dazu...
 Returning the scales that  have tipped toward darkness
 back to the light.
 Isn't that right, Kabwe?
 All of the scales in this kingdom shall be...
 Let's go.
 Yes.
 I have committed a sin.
 Many sins.
 I killed my husband and his mother.
 They were scum.
 On the inside, they were laughing  and looking down on me.
 But they never said anything to suggest  that or let it show on their faces.
 So I could've continued  pretending not to know.
 But...
 Dear! Mother! Hang in there!
 H-Hurry and help us...
 Hurry up, you stupid...
 Good-for-nothing wench.
 Dazu...
 You two can just...
 Die.
 I don't regret letting those two die.
 Because that's what they deserved.
 The burn scar that he gave  me should fade over time.
 But the scars on my heart from  enduring their ridicule for so long
 will never go away.
 Above all, even after they died,  the vengeful flames that burn in my heart
 can never be extinguished.
 I... We...
 will make it to the Spade  Kingdom, no matter what.
 So that we can obtain the powers of the devil.
 This kingdom is still embroiled in chaos.
 The threat of the devil  draws near from the outside.

149,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 He puts in blood, sweat, and tears  in hopes of becoming the Wizard King.
 But there are also those in the kingdom  who possess at least a little bit of mana,
 yet can barely use any magic at all.
 The very few out of the population,  those who live in the shadows...
 They are also trying to survive.
 My prince, I've brought your tea.
 It's completely cold by now.
 Secré? How long have you been there?
 How long do you think?
 Sorry, I didn't see you.
 It doesn't bother me. This happens all the time.
 Take a look at this.
 ""First, a magic item that  stores and splits mana.""
 So what's this one do?
 It's a magic item that increases mana!
 Like the elves' magic stones, basically.
 Ah...
 There aren't many of them,
 but this kingdom does have people  who weren't blessed with mana.
 But once this is complete, we should  be able to resolve their concerns.
 Huh?
 Yes, and this should end the  discrimination that currently exists.
 But there are a few problems  I need to take care of first.
 Ah, it makes my head hurt...
 My prince thought about the future  of this kingdom more than anyone else.
 But...
 The burn scar that he gave  me should fade over time.
 But the scars on my heart from  enduring their ridicule for so long
 will never go away.
 Above all, even after they died,  the vengeful flames that burn in my heart
 can never be extinguished.
 I...
 will make it to the Spade  Kingdom, no matter what.
 So that we can obtain the powers of the devil.
 The reason she wanted the devil's powers
 and caused this whole incident
 was because she was born with very  little mana and suffered discrimination.
 Maybe this kingdom hasn't changed  that much in the past 500 years.
 Two Things We Need to Find
 I'm sure you can guess why  I summoned you all here today.
 I wanted to ask you some questions regarding  the incident with the Devil Believers.
 Ask us anything.
 Right, kid?
 Sure?!
 All right, then, let's get started. First...
 Could you tell me what  you talked about that day
 with one of the leaders of the  Devil Believers, Dazu Tayak?
 The difference in mana... Those blessed  with abundant mana and those who aren't.
 There's no doubt that the gap between  those two is what caused this incident.
 Discrimination is something  we must get rid of at any cost.
 Is there something up with Nero?
 Oh, it's nothing.
 Pardon me.
 Lord Julius, we just received
 a message from Queen Loropechika  of the Heart Kingdom.
 Loropechika
 Huh?
 So she's the Queen of the Heart Kingdom.
 You three...
 We just happened to be  summoned by the Wizard King.
 I see.
 It's a pleasure to meet you.
 You must be the Captain of  the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.
 Hey, nice to meet you.
 I guess she really does know about me.
 You may have gathered why  I'm contacting you today.
 As I mentioned to you previously,
 we were preparing for you to train with  our elite guard, the Spirit Guardians,
 and those preparations are now complete.
 Are you okay, Loropechika?
 What just happened?!
 Did something happen to the queen?
 What, though?!
 Maybe Megicula's curse suddenly advanced?
 No!
 Finral!
 Huh? But...
 We'll take care of all the paperwork.
 We're counting on you.
 Right!
 Asta, sorry, but do you  mind if she stays behind?
 Huh?
 I'm fine with that.
 Asta!
 I can't keep this open for  long over such a distance...
 Hurry!
 Okay, I'm off!
 It'll probably be easier to speak  with you if you're not in that form.
 Could you come with me  to the basement library?
 There's something I'd like you to see.
 Marx, I expect you to fill out  all the paperwork required
 for them to enter the Heart Kingdom.
 Huh? Er, yes, of course.
 All right, let's go.
 Wait, why are we outside the palace?
 I think... the queen is generating  a force field made of mana,
 so we can't enter the palace.
 Spirit Guardian Gaja
 You lot...
 I don't know what you're doing here,
 but this is clearly unlawful  entry to our kingdom,
 unless you can prove otherwise.
 W-W-W-Wait!
 Our Wizard King will eventually contact you.
 Yes... What?
 Forms have been submitted from
 the Clover Kingdom to allow  entry into our kingdom?
 Very well.
 Pardon my rudeness.
 Allow me to lead you to the queen.
 Welcome, everyone.
 She seems to be dressed pretty rough  compared to last time...
 Even if her clothes are different,  they can't hide her beauty!
 She is truly a goddess who has  descended upon this land!
 Finral! You're supposed to change, remember?!
 By the way, what brings you here today?
 Oh, right!
 It doesn't look like her curse is acting up...
 Is there something about my curse?
 Oh, for goodness' sake, Loropechika.
 So that's the Water Spirit.
 You had a stomachache because  the things you ate for lunch
 didn't agree with each other?
 I told her not to eat hard bacon  and red spinach together.
 But that part of her is adorable, too.
 If you will excuse me...
 Thanks.
 Guess I'll head back, too.  I've got something to do.
 Head back? But how?
 How do you think?
 I'm gonna die...
 But thank goodness it wasn't your curse.
 As I was trying to tell you earlier,
 the preparations for your  training are complete.
 And so...
 Huh?
 What's wrong?
 My glasses are missing!
 Your glasses?
 Wait, you just noticed?!
 Wow, her eyesight is...
 ...shockingly bad?!
 Come on, now, Loropechika.
 That was your last pair.
 I end up stepping on them,  kicking them, dropping them,
 H-Huh?
 sitting on them... I basically  break my glasses all the time.
 And they're custom-made.
 In that case, I'll help you find them!
 Oh, don't worry. I have an  idea as to where they are.
 Huh?
 This is...
 She's gathering information from all around?
 This is only one part of it,  but it should be enough for now.
 She's usually watching  over the whole kingdom.
 The whole kingdom...
 Oh, there they are!
 I knew it was Mugi!
 Mugi?
 Wait, then is that creature—
 It's alive?!
 Oh, I forgot to introduce you.
 This is the thick-pelted beaver,  Big Mugi. She's Mugi's mother.
 Mugi comes here often with Big Mugi.
 Or you might say they just waltz right in.
 Why in the world does she look so smug?
 Sh-She's so cute!
 The only problem is they're  quite the troublemakers,
 and they take my things  without permission sometimes.
 All right!
 I'll head on over and get your  glasses back from this Mugi!
 Huh? But it's okay...
 You're gonna be training us soon!
 This is nothing!
 Oh, fine...
 I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna pass.
 But wait... If I make a good  impression on the queen...
 Wait, no... That's not it, Finral.  This is just another trial to break my curse!
 Leave getting your glasses back to us!
 Let's go, Asta!
 All right, we're off!
 So that's the thick-pelted beavers' lodge...
 There they are!
 Leave it to me!
 Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!
 As well as... Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!
 Way to go, Finral!
 Easy-peasy!
 Oh, no! You can't hold them like that!
 Are you okay?!
 What are you doing?!
 You're not getting away!
 Perhaps Mugi is finally  getting its just deserts.
 Really?
 No, I can't!
 That thing is seriously pissing me off.
 That's just another reason they're so cute.
 Looks like it's my turn.
 What the heck is he doing?
 Huh? He's fishing, isn't he?
 Well, that much is obvious!
 You'll be giving those back.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow!
 So that must be
 the ki that's commonly used  in the Land of the Sun.
 So that's how...
 That must be how he found you, even though  I was concealing you and your mana.
 Yes.
 It doesn't matter if he has anti-magic  or if he's at the arcane stage.
 He's going to become stronger.
 Let's trade.
 Way to go, Asta!
 Thank you so much.
 Now I can see all of your  faces... clearly... a-again?
 Oh, Loropechika...
 What?!
 Loropechika, is your hand okay? Are you hurt?
 I-I'm fine...
 I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! What have I done?
 Are your eyes actually bad?
 Huh?
 You could see us just fine  the last time we met.
 You see, when Loropechika  is in her royal gown,
 she's using Mana Zone, so she  can detect what's around her.
 It has nothing to do with  if she can see or not.
 You wouldn't need glasses if you  just did that regularly, would you?
 My mana isn't infinite.
 I want to avoid using up too much of it,  just in case something happens.
 Especially considering Loropechika has
 a Mana Zone barrier up all around  the Heart Kingdom at all times.
 I have returned, Your Majesty.
 Oh, perfect timing.
 I apologize for keeping you waiting.
 It's fine.
 Is that...
 I went to retrieve the new ones.
 Then are all those...
 There can never be enough.
 Then everything we just went through was...
 I'm very sorry. I tried to stop you, but...
 This is all your fault.
 My fault?!
 Oh, yeah. I guess I'm the one  who said we'd get them back.
 But I thank you from the bottom of my  heart for doing all of that for me.
 Please rely on us whenever you're in need!
 Damn it, Finral, no!
 Now, let us get back on the topic at hand.
 The reason the preparations for  your training took so long...
 Um...
 Yes?
 We're over here.
 Oh, I'm terribly sorry about that.
 The reason the preparations for  your training took so long...
 is so that the Spirit Guardians  could meet you in top form.
 But there is also a limit to how  many the Spirit Guardians can train.
 All right! I'm getting fired up!
 No one said you were going to train yet.
 What?!
 No, since they're both at the arcane stage, we need Asta and Nero to participate.
 Nero, too?
 Wait, the arcane stage? Does that mean  the Wizard King and Captain Yami, too?
 I'm certain those two don't need our training.
 And it appears that your captain
 has already figured out how to  get to an even higher plane.
 Yami has?
 When?
 As embarrassing as this is, I've lost the key.
 From what I've heard, your magic  allows you to open and close things?
 Would you mind opening that for me?
 I wonder what he wants to show me.
 Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.
 That's...
 Your real name is Secré, right?
 ""Secré is going to love this!""  was scribbled onto this page.
 My prince!
 There aren't many of them,
 but this kingdom does have people  who weren't blessed with mana.
 But once this is complete, we should  be able to resolve their concerns.
 Yes, and this should end the  discrimination that currently exists.
 But back then, they probably lacked
 the technique to create this magic item,  so it was never completed.
 I know.
 But I've sent a request to the
 Magic Item Research Lab at the  Magic Knights' headquarters
 to have it made according to this blueprint.
 If this had already been completed...
 People like the Devil Believers'  leader, Dazu Tayak,
 and those who follow her  may have never come to exist.
 Those blessed by magic  and those who aren't...
 In order to end the  discrimination between them,
 this is one of the things most  necessary to the Clover Kingdom.
 Is something wrong?
 N-No...
 We're back!
 Today was so exhausting...
 Welcome back.
 Thanks.
 What did you and the Wizard King talk about?
 Nothing really.
 Did something good happen, Nero?
 Huh?
 You look happy.
 She's right.
 You've been looking pretty down lately,  but today is different.
 She has?!
 You all look pretty happy yourselves.
 Well, of course we do!
 We're finally going to be training  with the Spirit Guardians!
 Of course, you're coming with us, Nero.
 I see.
 Let's do our best!
 All right.
 My prince, your will has  definitely been carried on.
 Julius Novachrono...
 He thinks about the future of the  Clover Kingdom just as much as you did.
 My prince, I will become stronger  so that I can protect this kingdom.
 Stronger... I have to get stronger.
 Or I can't protect this kingdom!
 I can't fight!
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 150:  ""The Maidens' Challenge.""

150,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 I can't leave things the way they are.
 Finral is becoming more reliable,  and Gordon's become more upbeat.
 Both Magna and Luck have gotten stronger,
 and Noelle's learning one  powerful spell after another.
 Asta has always been moving forward.
 I think Gauche has become a bit  more approachable... maybe.
 Everyone's moving forward, but I'm still  embarrassed about anyone seeing me.
 I'm still scared.
 I'm better now than I was then,
 but I want to stop feeling  embarrassed in my true form.
 I have to change!
 The Maidens' Challenge
 Wh-What?
 What is it? Do you need something?
 U-Um! Um!
 Are you not feeling well?
 Um!
 Please make me your student!
 Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
 I want to get over my shyness.
 Why?
 When we fight the Spade Kingdom or the devil,  I can't help anyone if I'm like this.
 Why don't you just transform and fight?
 That's not good enough!
 I have to be the real me.
 Why me, though?
 Basically everyone on our  team is pretty confident.
 You're the only one who can help me with this!
 You're always so confident and refined,  because you're royalty.
 I want to be like you, Noelle!
 Ah, you have excellent judgment.
 Well, if you insist, I guess I don't  mind helping you out as a royal.
 Thank you very much!
 Just so you know, I don't hold back.
 Okay! Th-Thank you!
 If being looked at embarrasses you,  we'll just have to get you over that.
 O-Okay!
 I'm going to look at you, so just act normal.
 Show me your face!
 I can't!
 Okay... There, I closed my eyes. How about now?
 I-I'm okay.
 Okay, again.
 This is pretty bad.
 Okay, how about this?
 You're fine if I'm not that close, right?
 No... As long as you're looking at me...
 Looks like this is going to take a while.
 I'll help, too.
 Gordon!
 I'm always very aware of what  my precious friends are doing.
 So I've been watching you two  from here this whole time.
 This whole time?
 I-I'm so embarrassed!
 I hope you'll let me help  with my best friend's growth.
 It's probably hard having a real  person look at you right away.
 You should get used to  being around my dolls first.
 So we're taking this in steps.
 That's not a bad idea.
 We'll do our best not to  look at you, so give it a try.
 O-Okay!
 Hey, Grey!
 Act normally! You shouldn't  be embarrassed around a doll!
 G-Good morning...
 With more energy!
 B-But...
 He's still looking at me!
 Buck up! You want to be like me, don't you?
 Just like Noelle...
 This doll's no big deal.
 There's no point if you transform!
 Y-You're right!
 But don't forget how you felt just now.
 Yes, you will transform... but only your mind.
 Th-That sounds difficult.
 I-I have nothing to be embarrassed about.
 Jumping straight to my level will  be difficult. I'm royalty, after all.
 Then what should I do?!
 Maybe you can start with Asta.
 He's really easy to understand.
 Asta... Asta...
 Heya, Miz Charmy! What's for lunch today?!
 Perfect! Just keep that up!
 She sounds a lot like him.
 Thanks for always helping me out, Noelle!
 It's great to know you're on my side in battle!
 We're gonna have to fight  some really strong guys soon,
 but I know we can win if I'm with you!
 I don't know why you can  win with me, but fine.
 U-Um, I look forward to working with you!
 It's difficult getting over your weakness.
 Sorry, I don't know what other kind  of advice I can give you right now.
 Especially since I can't understand  feeling embarrassed just by
 having someone look at me.
 I'm sorry I couldn't help out.
 I hope you'll be able to find a good teacher.
 Hey.
 Is that you, Grey?
 What do you want, and why are you in my form?
 I want to ask a favor.
 What?
 Be my mentor.
 What am I supposed to teach you?
 Our magic attributes are  completely different.
 If I undo my transformation, I become  embarrassed whenever someone sees me.
 Tell me how I can be more confident.
 Tch! Why do I have to do that?
 Ask someone else. I'm busy.
 Don't be so stingy. Just tell me.
 I won't get anything out of helping you.
 I guess you're right. Then I guess  I'll do one thing you ask me to.
 What's all this?
 Turn into Marie and say  the lines I've written here.
 We'll start with...
 I love you, Big Brother!
 That's a must!
 Also...
 I worked really hard to make this  for you, Big Brother! Eat up!
 And this is also absolutely necessary.
 Let's be together forever, Big Brother!
 There's plenty more, but say  those like you mean them.
 I'm not actually Marie.  Will that still make you happy?
 I only get to see the  real Marie once a month.
 I'll be able to get by as long  as you look and sound like her.
 O-Oh, I see...
 Okay, follow me.
 You just want to be okay  with being seen, right?
 Yeah.
 First, undo your transformation.
 I-I'm being seen! I'm being  seen from every possible angle!
 Try to survive this.
 S-S-S-S-Survive...
 Um... U-Use what I learned earlier...
 J-J-J-J-Just transform my mind to Asta's...
 H-H-Hey... G-G-Gauche...
 I can't!
 I guess it's no use.
 Hey. Stand up and open your eyes.
 I-I can't!
 Calm down. I'm not looking at you anymore.
 Huh?
 Well, what do we do about this?
 Wait, is this...
 Hey, can you hear my voice?
 Stand up.
 Raise your right hand.
 Now raise your left leg.
 She fell into a trance as she  watched the butterfly pass by.
 This should work!
 Now, how do I get her to not worry  about people looking at her?
 A turtle.
 From now on, you're going to  be a turtle. A very big turtle.
 Whether it's windy, rainy, or people are  staring at you, you just don't care.
 You are a turtle!
 I'm...
 looking at you.
 All right! It worked!
 Hey, say something!
 Oh, right. Turtles don't talk.
 Well, that's not good.
 You're now going to turn back into a human.
 But your mind will remain a turtle.
 You'll be a human who's never fazed  by anything, just like a turtle.
 I'm... a human.
 I'm looking at you.
 I don't have to hide my face.
 I can bear it!
 Perfect.
 How are you doing?
 I'm still a little anxious,  but I feel completely different... now.
 I'm sure you do. You have  the mind of a turtle now.
 Eventually, you won't care about  people looking at you at all.
 Yes...
 If you're fine on this crowded street,
 you should be fine being surrounded  by your friends at the hideout.
 I owe it all to you, Gauche. Thank you.
 In that case...
 I'll need you to keep your promise now.
 Huh?
 Don't tell me you actually forgot.
 Turn into Marie and say  those lines I wrote for you.
 Oh... Right.
 I love you, Big Brother!
 I love you too, Marie!
 Why did you turn back?
 I-I-I mean, this is a bit much...
 Transform.
 I-I'm too embarrassed...
 You turned back to normal!
 Well, that was a big waste of time.
 I-I'm really sorry!
 I mean, if you're not embarrassed  when you're transformed,
 then why don't you just stay  in that form like you used to?
 But then it wouldn't be the real me.
 What are you talking about?
 It doesn't matter what form  you take. You're always Grey.
 Gauche...
 You're so amazing, Sis!
 You can activate your spells  way faster than before!
 It's still not enough.
 This isn't enough to face the threat of  the Spade Kingdom, let alone the devil!
 Next! All five of you come at me at onc—
 I guess I can't even call  this training anymore.
 All right, let's take a break.
 It's rough not having any time off,
 but we definitely need to train for this  upcoming battle with the Spade Kingdom.
 We need to do our best right now  to protect the Clover Kingdom.
 Captain! We look forward to you whipping  us into shape in the afternoon, too!
 I intend to do just that.
 Just be careful not to injure yourselves.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Everyone is enthusiastic  about their training.
 They may be livelier now that I've eased the  restrictions on their interactions with men.
 I can't wait to go out on dates with  my boyfriend as soon as this whole mess
 with the Spade Kingdom and the devil is done.
 Me, too! We're gonna go  out on dates every day!
 I guess we'll just have  to get stronger first.
 Aw, no fair. I broke up  with my boyfriend recently.
 What? Did you dump him, or did he dump you?
 He dumped me...
 I see... Well, you've both been busy.
 Yeah, that's rough.
 But nothing good comes of dwelling on  the past, so move on to the next one!
 Yeah! One of my boyfriend's friends is single,  so let's all go drinking together soon.
 I can't get over it that quickly...
 W-Well, regardless of their motives,  their enthusiasm is good.
 Don't worry!
 Yeah, it's no big deal.
 I must lead them.
 You guys talking about romance again?  You're all helpless!
 What's so good about hanging out with men?
 Of course, Captain Charlotte,
 you'll be going out with Captain Yami  once this is all over, right?
 What's wrong, Captain?
 E-Er, it's nothing.
 By the way, Captain, have there  been any developments since?
 What do you mean by developments?
 Oh, come on! I'm talking about your  romance with Captain Yami, of course!
 Yeah! Were you able to go on  any dates after our mixer?
 M-Mixer...
 That was so much fun!
 I think Captain Yami just  needed one more push!
 Don't be absurd!
 No, no, you were going in the  right direction, Captain.
 If the Angel of Love, Puli Angel, says so,  then it must be true, Captain!
 Yeah.
 Really? Is that true?
 So, Captain, you are going out on  dates with Captain Yami, aren't you?
 Of course I'm not!
 What?!
 Though, in truth...
 After our last captains' meeting,
 I wanted to ask him to dinner,  and prepared a little gift to give him.
 But I just couldn't give it to him.
 Well, duh! Sis shines more on the  battlefield than in any dumb relationship!
 We need to prepare for the threat of  the Spade Kingdom and the devil right now.
 Non, non! This is the perfect time to strike!
 Everyone is on edge because  of the upcoming battle.
 That's why everyone needs  a little extra love.
 I know I mentioned that  I want to go out on a date
 with my boyfriend once this is all over,
 but we go on dates occasionally anyway.
 I haven't seen mine,  but we've been chatting through our
 magic communication items every night.
 Seriously...
 And now is a once in a lifetime chance.
 What's that supposed to mean?
 When a man and a woman share a  sense of impending danger together,
 they become closer!
 Now that we're facing the impending  danger of the Spade Kingdom
 and the devil, it's the perfect chance.
 You can't be serious.
 Anyway, this is the  opportune chance for love!
 If you use it wisely...
 I can't let a man save me.
 What are you talking about?  You save me all the time.
 Huh?
 My love for you is what  keeps me going all the time.
 Yami...
 Charlotte, I want...
 to start a family with you.
 Of course!
 And then the two get  married and lived happ—
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
 That's not happening!
 But it could!
 Even so, losing our next battle wouldn't mean  facing mere anxiety or a sense of danger.
 We would be dead.
 To avoid that, we must train!
 I'm sure you're all plenty rested now!
 Captain Charlotte is amazing.
 I guess she doesn't let love get in the way.
 We need to work hard so this  danger can pass quicker!
 Sol, Puli, Selena, Galgaria...
 All of you, attack me at once!
 All right! Here we go, Sis!
 Stone Creation Magic: Stone Rain!
 Water Creation Magic: Cascade Destroyer!
 Earth Magic: Mud Wall Partition!
 No!
 Galgar—
 Crap! I won't make it in ti—
 Our captain is so dazzling.  She fights so elegantly.
 I'm sure Captain Yami loves this, too.
 Huh?
 Damn it! I thought I had a chance!
 Everything must be according to her plans!
 Our captain is amazing.
 Let's do our best not to hold her back.
 The four of you can rest a while.  The other seven of you, attack me at once.
 What do you think?
 What?! We can't do that!
 No, we totally can.
 It'll serve as training for us, too.
 And we'll be supporting  Captain Charlotte, too.
 It's two birds with one stone!
 What in the world are they discussing?
 Are they coming up with a strategy  for attacking me all at once?
 Say, Captain. We have a suggestion.
 What is it?
 This is difficult to say,
 but we don't think we can be worthy  training partners for you.
 I wouldn't say that.
 Even when the whole group of us attack,  we still aren't any match for you.
 Stop being so pathetic in front of Sis!
 But it's true.
 So we were wondering if we should  maybe train with another squad.
 Train with another squad?
 For example, if we were to  train with the Black Bulls,
 I think we could all find  worthy training partners.
 Whut?!
 They seem to have a mix  of the best and the worst,
 so they should be worthy opponents.
 Captain, could you officially  request a joint training session?
 I-I see... Well, I don't know  if they'll accept, but...
 I'll find the right moment to ask.
 Captain Charlotte, do you have a moment?
 I'm free.
 If you're busy training,  I can call at another time.
 Well, we were just  discussing the possibility
 of a joint training session  with the Black Bulls.
 What did you need?
 I'd like to confirm the date  for the next captains' meeting.
 I'm assuming your plans haven't changed?
 Correct.
 Understood. Please excuse me.
 All right. For now, we're going  to continue doing what we can.
 We can worry about the joint  training session later.
 Right!
 Joint training with the Black Bulls...
 I wonder if he'll be suspicious...  No, this is merely training.
 Yes, this is for survival.  To help us defeat the enemy...
 Why're you just standing there?
 Ya—
 This is it, Charlotte. Ask Yami if he'd  agree to the joint training session.
 I guess even the Spiny Prickly Queen  trips sometimes, huh?
 I got to see something rare today.
 Seriously? Again?
 You're shattering my sensitive,  fragile heart of glass here.
 Other than the Captain of the  Blue Rose Knights, everyone is present.
 So Charlotte's late?
 She arrived late to the  Star Festival with Yami.
 I wonder what happened this time.
 By the way, it seems the Blue Rose Knights are
 trying to plan a joint training  session with the Black Bulls.
 Perhaps this is related.
 A joint training session, huh?  Hey, I just had a great idea.
 Huh?
 The kingdom's citizens are still
 emotionally and physically exhausted  from the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attacks.
 I can't deny that.
 I'm sure they're worried about whether  the royal family can protect them or not.
 We need to reassure them that the Magic  Knights have the strength to protect them,
 and raise the morale of the captains  and Magic Knights, too.
 So that we can face the impending threat  of the Spade Kingdom and the devil.
 Um... If I may, what exactly  are you planning to do?
 I'm going to have the  captains fight each other.
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 151:

 ""Clash! The Battle of the  Magic Knights Squad Captains!""
 D-Do your best, Captain Yami!
 You, too. Wanna train again?
 No!
 Okay, fine.
 I-I look forward to your guidance.
 Which is it?!

 battle it out before your very eyes!
 Also,

 Master Rill, those melancholy sighs  are a sign that you're in love,

 How long do I have to wear this disguise?
 Ah, Julius! Do not force yourself too much.
 Because this is a prime opportunity  for me to gain the favor of the citizens
 without Julius getting in the way!
 Oh, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
 We should probably figure something  else out for Owen's sake, too.
 How are you feeling?  How are you feeling right now?
 World Tree Magic: Magic Tree Descends!
 Do not touch the World Tree Magic!
 You're starting off with that?
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe!
 Not bad, Beanpole Monster.
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked—
 You're mine!
 I guess this was never going to be simple.
 Indeed.
 Then we'll just have to follow our plan.
 Understood.
 I know we talked about doing a joint  training session with the Black Bulls,
 but to think I'd end up  having to fight Yami...
 No, don't think about that now. Keep calm! Keep calm!
 Let's do our best, Charlotte!
 O-Of course!
 I don't remember the last  time I had so much fun.
 You're not getting away!
 Something, something, moth to the flame...
 Hold it!
 You accursed foreigner and former commoner...
 Let us strengthen our defense of our crystal.
 Where ya hidin'?
 Where do you think you're going,  Beanpole Monster?
 Huh? Don't order me around.
 This sure is a prime spot to get attacked.
 Who cares if it's a trap or not?
 It won't matter if we slice them all up!
 Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver.
 You should know that this spell is  not powerful enough to defeat me!
 And you should know as well...
 that I wouldn't run away without a plan.
 In that case...
 I shall burn you and your  meddlesome plan to ash!
 Sir Nozel, I shall assist you.
 When we previously fought, despite having  vortex magic amplified by the elf's mana,
 I was no match for Sir Fuegoleon.
 I will now get my revenge!
 Hmph.
 I have a plan. Follow my lead.
 I'm getting used to being  the king's attendant.
 After the amazing things I've done,  I'm sure the citizens are all wondering,
 ""Who's that really hot guy  next to the king?"" For sure!
 Swoon.
 Sekke, if by any chance the captains' spells  come this way, protect me with your life.
 Bah-ha?!
 Yeah, right! That ain't bah-happening!
 You two seem to be pretty  good at poking and prodding
 while keeping your distance!
 Dark Magic: Black Hole!
 This is...
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!
 Severing Magic: Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!
 Mercury Creation Magic:  Silver Star of Execution!
 Sorry about that. You guys were hiding  in the forest, and we sorta leveled it.
 That's quite all right.
 As long as we made you use up some magic.
 Hold it!
 Yoo-hoo!
 Yami!
 Beautiful!
 Our captain lured Captain Yami into  the dream world... How amazing!
 But alas, the communication magic  doesn't extend into the dream world.
 Sadly, we and the rest of the citizens  will not be able to see this
 beautiful battle take place!
 Ah...
 Being so beautiful is such a burden...
 Welcome to Dream Magic: Glamour World!
 Sit back and relax until  the time limit is up,
 Yami dear.
 I've heard from my squad  that if you fall asleep here,
 you won't be able to go back outside.
 And whatever you think up appears here.
 It sure does!
 In that case...
 Outdoor bath!
 Sushi on a boat!
 Daiginjo sake!
 Stuff I can't imagine isn't  going to show up here.
 Aw, you really got my hopes up, too.
 In that case...
 Exit!
 The little elf that took over my body
 had a rough time playing the  word association game before.
 I've made sure I won't make the same mistake.
 Guess that just means I'm gonna  have to face you head-on.
 That's more like it.
 Then...
 How about this?
 Dark Cloaked...
 Dark Cloaked...
 ...Lightless Slash!
 Howdy doody!
 I'm the great Captain of  the Black Bulls, Yami! Yar!
 Is that how I sound in her damn head?
 The foreigner's mana disappeared.
 He must've been captured by the dream magic.  He won't be back out for a while.
 We need to avoid any more setbacks.
 We will take care of him right here and now!
 Leave this to me!
 In most cases, I would have the  upper hand against mercury magic.
 But because he's constantly using  an immense amount of mana,
 this cage is instantly repaired.
 Though I'd like to take  down the spellcasters,
 they're both outside the vortex magic.
 An excellent strategy!
 Brother!
 Thanks to the combination of wide-range  silver magic and vortex magic,
 they have the advantage  against Captain Fuegoleon.
 So this is what it looks  like when captains fight...
 No...
 My brother's just getting warmed up!
 What is he going to do with all those flames?
 He can't be...
 Though the flames won't  reach us, the heat will...
 But what is he...
 How hot is he planning to...
 Where did Sir Fuegoleon go?
 He used Salamander as a decoy  to get by our mana detection.
 I'm not done yet!
 Howdy doody...
 I mean, we all know a copy  could never beat the original.
 Nay! You are still within the caster's spell!
 The best thing about copies is  you can just keep making them!
 It doesn't matter how many  fakes you send after... me...
 Aw... shit.
 Dark Cloaked... Dark Cloaked... Dark  Cloaked... Dark Cloaked... Dark Cloaked...
 ...Lightless Slash!
 Kaiser!
 It's weak, but I sense Sir Jack's mana!
 Things are grim...
 If we can hit him with even  a single magical attack,
 we still have a chance.
 So you still have enough  strength to keep struggling.
 Mercury Magic: Silver Shining Regal Spear!
 I cannot hold out much longer!
 After all that talk...
 Is this all you've got, you former commoner?
 Well done, Yami dear!  You're tougher than I thought!
 But you're probably nearing your limit now.
 My limit, eh?
 Guess you've still got a lot  to learn about me...
 Little Miss Pointy Hat.
 I'll show you the spell I used back then...
 when I truly surpassed my limits!
 Are you still functional?
 Don't compare me to the small fry!
 We'll have no other chances.  We're ending this now.
 Who do you think you're ordering  around, Mr. Sparkle Pants?
 Now!
 Not happening.
 As a royal who protects the masses,  and as the Captain of the Silver Eagles,
 I cannot let myself lose so pathetically!
 I'm sure you're watching, my squad!
 There is nothing the flames  of the Crimson Lion Kings
 cannot incinerate!
 Ooh!
 I'm a Magic Knights Squad Captain, too!
 I have to get strong enough that I can  trap even a devil in my dream world!
 Y'all are the image of the past me,  who Miss Pointy Hat imagined me to be.
 But I've already...
 grown beyond that!
 Mana Zone...
 Dark Cloaked...
 Dimension Slash ~ Equinox!
 Wow, that was such a fantastic battle!
 I can't believe I got to see an  exchange of magic like that!
 Especially that last one!
 To think that Yami's Dimension Slash ended  up slicing through both teams' crystals!
 You made us do all that, and it's a draw?
 All because you were too busy  playing around in a dream!
 Those fools are beyond saving.
 That's because you guys had Golden Weird  Mask Guy sucking up all of your damn mana!
 I'm surprised they have the strength to  keep arguing after going all-out like that.
 What? You want a piece of me, meathead?
 Aw... Yami dear wouldn't  let up in Glamour World,
 What? Come at me!
 so I didn't get to be on the broadcast at all.
 Y-Yami dear?! What happened  between these two?!
 It was amazing! To think your magic  still had so many possibilities!
 I'm almost certain he just wanted  to see the captains use their magic.
 You did great too, Marx!
 I'm glad the whole kingdom got to see  this battle between the captains.
 And I'm sure the citizens are  relieved to know they have
 amazing Magic Knights such as  yourselves protecting this kingdom.
 And I'm sure after seeing  all of you captains... no,
 Grand Magic Knights in action,  your squad members' image of you will change.
 The battle against the Spade Kingdom  and the devil is drawing near.
 Use this battle to propel you and your  Magic Knights to even greater heights!
 Yes, sir!

 A-Ahem... Yami, it seems that dream  magic gave you quite a bit of trouble.
 What exactly were you doing in there?
 Oh, that.
 Another me showed up,  and he was stupidly strong.
 Another Yami, you say?!
 You've got the Sexy Yami.
 And the Wild Yami.
 Which do you prefer?
 Huh?

 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!

 The Magic Knights Squads.
 Nine squads of Magic Knights  who specialize in combat,
 all in direct service to the Wizard King.
 They are an army of heroes who dedicate  their lives to protecting their kingdom.
 It is said that a Magic Knights Squad Captain  possesses the strength of a hundred mages.
 The Wizard King and the Magic Knights Squads  are the idols of the Clover Kingdom.
 These squad captains  faced each other in battle!
 It was a mock tournament held  by Julius, the Wizard King,
 meant to strengthen the fighting  spirit of the Magic Knights Squads.

 Asta and the other Magic Knights renewed  their promise to protect the Clover Kingdom
 and its people from the threat of  the Spade Kingdom and the devil,
 and to become much, much stronger.
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 In September, the Magic Knights trained daily
 to prepare for the upcoming battle  with the Spade Kingdom and the devil.
 After seeing the captains fight,  Asta and Noelle felt even more motivated,
 and continued their own training as  they awaited the day they would train
 with the Heart Kingdom's Spirit Guardians.
 Asta! Noelle!
 Hey, let's go.
 Yes, sir!
 It's already time?
 I get to go out with my friends.
 My heart leaps with joy.  I can't help but smile.
 Sure thing!
 Clover Kingdom
 Castle Town Kikka
 Looks like the town has mostly recovered  from the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack.
 Captain Yami, thank you for  bringing us along with you!
 I just brought you along because you  wouldn't shut up about wanting to come.
 I wanted to go back to my roots!
 It's already been a year.
 It feels so long, yet somehow,
 it feels like it passed in the blink of an eye.
 On this day, the annual Magic Knights  Entrance Exam was being held in the coliseum.
 Good luck on the Entrance Exam!
 You're the Clover Kingdom's stars of hope!
 The kingdom's future is in your hands!
 Partially because of all the chaos caused by
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack,
 there were fewer applicants than in years prior.
 Listen up! Whatever you do, don't interfere.
 Right!
 That's obvious.
 Look, Noelle! That was us a year ago!
 Someone out of that crowd  might end up being our junior.
 Miss Noelle!
 I wonder if they'll call  me something like that.
 That wouldn't be so bad.
 Asta! Above you!
 Huh?
 Ack! What the heck's with these birds?!
 Wait, are these the  anti-birds I've heard about?
 What? The ones that peck at you  if you don't have much mana?
 Hey! Get away from me!
 Get away from me!
 Get off me!
 What the heck was that?
 How little mana do you have if  a swarm that big pecks at you?
 I guess someone always has it worse.
 What the heck is Stupidsta doing?
 Noelle.
 Nozel.
 You came.
 Yes. Stupids—
 Asta invited me.
 He thought we may be able to go  back to our roots as Magic Knights
 in order to prepare for our upcoming battle.
 So it's already been a year.
 Okay!
 What are you doing?
 Oh, I'm... um...
 I told you. There's no need for royalty  to take the same exam as the peasants.
 But...
 Your destination has already been decided.
 Do not take unnecessary action.
 Yes, Brother Nozel.
 Your existence itself is unnecessary.
 I understand now, though.
 That was all my brother's kindness.  He just didn't want me to go to the battlefield.
 What is it?
 N-Nothing. I was just...
 At first, I couldn't help but wonder  why I got put in the Black Bulls.
 But now, I can truly say that I'm grateful
 that you put me with the Black Bulls.
 I now have precious friends  and a precious family.
 I was able to share experiences  I wouldn't trade for the world.
 You've grown, Noelle.
 Thank you very much!
 And you have the potential to grow even more.
 You will probably become even stronger.
 Yes... Just like Mother.
 I said get away from me!
 Ugh!
 The Magic Knights Squad Captains...
 Th-They have such presence.
 I am the Captain of the Golden Dawn,  William Vangeance.
 I will be conducting the Magic  Knights Entrance Exam.
 First, I would like to commend you all for  participating in this exam to protect
 this kingdom and its people after the  attack by the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 The hero, Lord Vangeance...
 ...is praising us?
 And I want you to know this.
 Even if you do not pass, that is not the end.
 Anyone can retry as many times as they'd like.
 Now, then...
 Magic Tree Descends!
 Let us now begin the  Magic Knights Entrance Exam!
 Wow, this takes me back!
 Remember how you couldn't fly  at all back then, Stupidsta?
 You were watching me?
 Well, you stuck out like a sore thumb.  Of course I noticed you.
 Not only could you not fly,  but you had no mana at all,
 so I thought you were going to fail for sure.
 But then...
 You're funny, kid.
 Join my squad.
 Huh?
 I'm telling you that I'll let  you join the Black Bulls.
 Captain Yami acknowledged you. And then...
 Even if you got hurt and battered,
 you never gave up.
 No matter how many times you fell,
 you always, always got back up again.
 Right here, right now...
 I'll surpass my limits!
 You were able to overcome any obstacle.
 You truly are amazing.
 Wha?
 O-Only a little bit, though!
 Thanks, Noelle!  You're pretty amazing yourself!
 You have an insane amount of mana,
 and you keep learning how to use  one new spell after another.
 That water armor's super cool, too!
 That's not water armor.  That's my Valkyrie Armor.
 Yeah, exactly. That water armor!
 You're super amazing!
 I'm not that impressive.
 We went through so many hardships.
 Yeah.
 And I'm sure there are many more hardships  we can't even imagine awaiting us.
 But we have the captains  and a bunch of our friends!
 And new strength!
 We're going to protect the  people no matter what!
 By combining our strengths!
 Let's become stronger.
 Much, much stronger.
 Say, Yuno. What's so fun about this?
 Oh, you're just so cool!
 Hey, wait, Stupidsta. Where are you going?
 Hey, Yuno!
 Gah, it's him again.
 You're here too, Yuno?
 Don't just wander off without  saying anything, you silent stud.
 Shrug.
 Did you just say ""shrug"" at me?!
 You seriously just spoke a sound effect?!
 He's just so cool.
 Yeah, right! He's not cool at all!  He's just trying to act cool!
 What do you mean, trying?
 Yuno doesn't have to try to  be cool. He is cool, right?
 Though I guess since you're here,  you felt the same way I did.
 The same?
 We both swore that we'd  become the Wizard King!
 You?!
 Not just me!
 I'll... never cry again.
 Maybe I... no...
 Yuno?
 I will...
 I'll become the Wizard King, too!
 I'll get stronger, and protect  you and everyone else!
 I'm gonna make everyone happier!  So we can have nicer things!
 Let's see who can become the Wizard King!
 Though I'm going to be the one who wins.
 Say what?! I'm gonna win!
 No, me.
 Me!
 So...
 Were you able to go back  to your roots or whatever?
 Yes! Thank you so much!
 I see.
 I'm feeling more motivated, too.
 I'm going to become even stronger  and make even more friends.
 I'm going to become stronger, too!
 So I can make the Black Bulls  the best Magic Knights Squad ever!
 And so I can defeat this curse  and win Miss Finnes's trust.
 Let's all do our best!
 So, Captain, did you recruit anyone new?
 Do I have a junior now?
 Well, there was someone interesting, but...
 But?!
 Another squad swiped them.
 What?!
 Which means you two are at  the bottom for another year.
 What?!
 Come on, let's go home.
 I knew I'd find you here.
 Hey there, Marx. What a coincidence.
 You left the castle.  There's nothing coincidental about it.
 Let's hurry back. Your work  just continues to pile up.
 I know.
 But...
 But?
 Young people are joining the  Magic Knights Squads to work hard
 to protect the people and this kingdom.
 Just seeing them seems to give me courage.
 Yes, you're right. They give  us hope for the future.
 Yes.
 All right, let's head back.
 Marx, do you like grilled purple snake?
 What are you talking about?
 If you do, I thought I'd catch  one and grill it up for you.
 There's no need for that.
 Aw... Asta would be more  than happy to eat it.
 Yuno.
 There's something I want to give you.
 What is it?
 My pendant... But how?
 A man named Revchi brought it.
 He did?
 Apparently, it was among
 the treasures that he and Gueldre  took from the Shadow Palace.
 He was probably afraid of what  you'd do to him if you ever found out.
 This magic stone belongs to you.
 Yes.
 To think it'd come back to me because  of him. You can't be serious.
 Good for you, Yuno.
 Today marks exactly a year.  You've helped me out so much.
 Thank you.
 I expect great things from you.  Well, everyone is waiting. Let's go.
 All right, let's do this.
 More training?! Let's do it!
 The hell are you talking about?  We're having a party.
 A party?
 We're celebrating the first  anniversary since you two joined.
 A lot is happening right now,  but it's the least we can do.
 Magna and the others  should be back soon, too.
 Thanks!
 I guess I'll let you celebrate, for my sake.
 All right! Forget about fighting  just for tonight, and eat and drink!
 Right!
 Let's have fun tonight.
 Let's talk friendship until morning.
 We're back!
 We're back, Charmy.
 I've gotten stronger since then.
 But...
 ...it's not enough.
 I'm going to rise even higher  and become the Wizard King.
 I'm going to rise even higher  and become the Wizard King!
 It's been a year since the kid and  Noelle joined the Black Bulls.
 Time sure does fly.

 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!

 I've been informed that the recovery  efforts in even the hardest-hit
 parts of the Forsaken Realm are now underway.
 Things are finally looking brighter as a whole.
 Yes. And to make this peace an eternal  one rather than a fleeting one,
 we must remain strong.
 It's nearly time.
 You have the captains' meeting as well  as a special decoration ceremony.
 You're going to have a busy day.
 Indeed.
 The Chosen Ones
 Our topic today is who will participate  in the Heart Kingdom's training.
 Our promise with the Heart Kingdom's  queen... In other words,
 the battle with the Spade Kingdom,  is drawing nearer as we speak.
 I know that every squad is  working hard to get stronger,
 but we just received word  from the Heart Kingdom that
 preparations for training are done.
 Our training is finally in its final stage.
 There are five Spirit Guardians  who will help us train,
 and there is a limited number  that each of them can train.
 So I'd like all of you to nominate  members of your squad.
 Now, who would like to get us started?
 From my squad, I'm choosing Asta and Nero,
 though they were already  chosen by the Heart Kingdom.
 Asta, who uses anti-magic,
 and Nero, who uses forbidden magic,  are already at the arcane stage.
 We know from our previous  battle that their powers will be
 our trump card in defeating the devil.
 I hope they can make those powers  their own even more through training.
 I'm also going to be sending Finral,  Luck, and Noelle from my squad.
 What's this? Are you worried?
 No matter how tough you act, you're such  a softie when it comes to your sister.
 Apparently Luck and Noelle both  pair well with their magic.
 Well, the Heart Kingdom does have a  Spirit Guardian who controls lightning,
 and their queen controls  the Water Spirit, Undine.
 Since Luck controls lightning magic  and Noelle controls water magic,
 it should be perfect.
 And I'm not surprised that Luck is super  excited, since he's always rarin' to go,
 but even Noelle's super motivated right now.
 Well, they are up against Megicula,  who killed their mother.
 And as for Finral...
 Well, he's handy to have around.
 If a reliable supporter  like him is able to level up,
 our strength as a whole should rise.
 He may also provide hints  to a new way of fighting.
 Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
 So from the Black Bulls, we have
 Asta, Nero, Noelle Silva,  Luck Voltia, and Finral Roulacase,
 making five members.
 That's quite a few.
 Nothing wrong with having  so many guys with potential.
 They're who I'm gonna go with.
 I nominate Mimosa Vermillion  from the Golden Dawn.
 We're up against the devil-possessed.
 I'm sure we will face some  cruel, ruthless battles.
 The cornerstone of these battles  will be recovery mages.
 She is a royal who also possesses  substantial natural talent,
 and stretching her potential  is sure to benefit our kingdom.
 I see. Is Mimosa your only nominee?
 I hear that the Wind Spirit Guardian  will also be training our nominees.
 Yuno declined.
 I assume he has his reasons.
 Please nominate Magic Knights  from other squads, too.
 I nominate Leopold Vermillion  from the Crimson Lion Kings.
 Leo's ambition is high, and he  asked our older sister, Mereoleona,
 to train him at the volcano  in the strong magic region.
 I can clearly imagine what kind  of hell that must've been.
 No one can beat Leopold's hard  work and ambition in my squad,
 but there is hesitation in him.
 I am hoping he can light a new flame  by training in another kingdom
 and burn away his hesitation.
 Once he is able to do that,
 he will be essential in the  battle against the Spade Kingdom,
 but he will also become a true lion king  capable of protecting this kingdom!
 I see.
 I look forward to seeing how he grows.
 What about the other squads?
 Anyone from the Blue Rose Knights?
 I'd like to confirm something first.
 Is it possible for a captain to participate?
 I see no problem with it.
 I personally think someone who was possessed by an elf, such as yourself,
 could produce some interesting results.
 The feeling of the mana from when my body  was possessed by an elf still remains.
 That red rose mana was far superior to mine.
 I cannot be picky in how I become stronger  for the battle against the devil.
 I need to experience something  similar again, no matter what!
 Wait, no! That's not what  I meant by ""experience""!
 Hmm?
 So the only nominee from the  Blue Rose Knights is the captain?
 Yes.
 Any others?
 This is a rather hard decision, but I  believe younger candidates are favorable.
 I agree. And I am very aware  of how to train myself.
 I don't mind going if I can  slice up the Heart Kingdom.
 Yeah, no. You're not going.
 This training will probably be grueling.
 But there will be knowledge and new  discoveries they won't find here,
 and a new world may open up to those who go.
 I'd like you all to use that to your advantage.
 My... My own...
 They're all my food!
 I'd like you to train hard every  day and grow ever vigilant.
 Training...
 Training means protein...
 This is for the protein!
 You all have wonderful potential,  so I'd like to see you grow.
 Growing bigger...
 This is for the fat!
 La!
 This is for the vitamins!
 This is for the fiber!
 This is for the collagen!
 Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!
 Goodness, aren't you full of energy?
 What got into you all of a sudden?
 I nominate myself from the Aqua Deer!
 I'm going to train, become stronger,
 and become a man that nice lady will notice!
 I think we actually have enough now,  but is there anyone else?
 The Silver Eagles will do everything they can
 to bolster their skills so that they  can face the Spade Kingdom.
 As will my squad.
 We're also doing things our own way!
 Then do we agree on the nominees mentioned?
 Aye.
 Good. I look forward to seeing  the fruits of your labor.
 Yes, sir.
 This concludes the Magic  Knights Squad Captains' meeting.
 Whew, we're finally done.
 See ya.
 And where do you think you're going?
 The special decoration ceremony  is just about to start.
 Seriously? I have to go to that?
 But I've got my wheels parked outside.
 It's not like anyone from  my squad got picked.
 We were told that every captain should  be in attendance for this ceremony.
 What? Why?
 Well, you see...
 The king will be participating this time.
 Seriously?
 Bah-ha... All the captains are here.
 They're so intense-ha.
 So they've made all the captains attend  because I am present. Excellent.
 Seriously, this is too close.  He's going to find out pretty soon.
 Captain Jack!
 Please...
 bring me back...
 to the squad.
 The hell's his problem?
 Talk about annoying.
 How about I slice you open?!
 It looks like everyone's here.
 Let us begin.
 We will now begin our special decoration  ceremony for the Magic Knights
 who fought bravely against  the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 Because the Wizard King's throat  is not completely healed,
 I will be conducting this ceremony.
 First...
 With 21 stars acquired, we have  Sol Marron from the Blue Rose Knights.
 You have been promoted to  5th Class Senior Magic Knight.
 Thanks to your calm and brave decisions,
 you got the gravely injured  Wizard King to a safe place.
 Please continue using that judgment  and drive in the battlefield.
 Oho! Impressive. She moved  up three ranks at once.
 She saved the Wizard King's life.  This promotion seems quite fitting.
 I wasn't actually calm at all back then.
 Not to mention, the guy who saved Sis  was the Captain of the Black Bulls.
 Next time, I'm gonna protect Sis  without the help of any man!
 Hey, uh... one of yours  seems to be glaring at me.
 Is that my problem?
 She's staring at Yami?
 Wait, no, Sol! Don't tell  me you like Yami, too!
 Sis is staring at me passionately!
 I'll do my best to live  up to your expectations!
 With 23 stars acquired,
 we have Mimosa Vermillion  from the Golden Dawn.
 You have been promoted to  2nd Class Intermediate Magic Knight.
 In the battle at the Shadow Palace,
 you showed humanity and effectively  did your job as a recovery mage.
 We look forward to you saving  many more lives in the future.
 I think people realize how important  recovery magic is because of Mimosa.
 I will live up to this honor that  I just received and do my best
 in the battle against the Spade Kingdom.
 With 18 stars acquired,
 we have Leopold Vermillion  from the Crimson Lion Kings.
 You have been promoted to  4th Class Senior Magic Knight.
 When the previous and  new captains were absent,
 you inspired the other squad members and  did everything in your power to stop
 your vice captain, who had  been possessed by an elf.
 Please continue to use your character to  raise everyone's morale on the battlefield
 and lead us to victory.
 So Leopold has also gone up three ranks.
 I would like to decline!
 Back then, if my brother hadn't shown up,
 my whole squad would have been annihilated.
 I did everything in my power,  but I was completely powerless.
 Everyone tried to protect me,  even if it cost them their lives.
 I'm just...
 I'm just a weakling, and I do  not deserve this recognition!
 You fool!
 Do you not understand why everyone  tried so hard to protect you?
 Is it not because they  were moved by your bravery,
 and because they saw hope  in your very existence?
 They entrusted you with the future  of the Crimson Lion Kings.
 This award includes
 the very determination, resolve,  and hope of the Crimson Lion Kings!
 Resolve and hope?
 I, Leopold Vermillion,  will live up to this recognition,
 do everything I can to protect  my squad from any enemy,
 and become a Lion King who  can lead everyone to victory!
 Yuno from the Golden Dawn.
 Yes, sir.
 You have earned 77 stars.
 Holy wow!
 Wait, how many stars did the  Aqua Deer have last time?
 Yuno of the Golden Dawn,
 you have been promoted to  1st Class Senior Magic Knight.
 What?!
 Bah-ha?!
 A 1st Class Senior Magic Knight?!  This peasant?!
 With your tremendous amount of mana,
 you were able to deal a fatal blow to  the devil, who was the root of all this evil.
 We look forward to great things from you.
 Yes, sir.
 He's now the same rank as  our vice captain, Langris.
 He suddenly jumped to the rank right  under the Magic Knights Squad Captains.
 I don't really get it, but you did good, right?
 Way to go, Yuno!
 To celebrate, let's go on a dat—
 1st Class Senior Magic Knight...
 I guess I got a little closer.
 These four members...
 Hold it!
 Well, this definitely sounds like  it's gonna be a pain in the ass.
 Silence, Yami. Despite how  he is, he's still our king.
 You just lowkey dragged said king.
 The one who shined the brightest in  this battle hasn't been recognized!
 The hero who protected the most  important person in this kingdom!
 Him! Sekke Bronzazza!
 Bah-ha?!
 Not only did all of you leave me,  your king, unattended,
 but some of you fools had  the nerve to attack me!
 Really?
 Who knows?
 Sekke is the true hero!  The epitome of Magic Knights!
 During that fierce battle, he dodged  the enemy's attacks and came to me!
 There's no doubt that he deserves the  most recognition out of anyone here!
 * Some facts may have been skewed.
 I-I just happened to show up-ha...
 With my authority as king, I give Sekke...
 the title of 1st Class Senior Magic Knight!
 F-First Class Senior Magic Knight?!
 What the bah-ha?!
 If that peasant gets to be a  1st Class Senior Magic Knight,
 I'm going to promote Sekke  to that rank, too!
 Bah-ha... Bah-ha... Bah-ha?!
 Th-This is, uh...
 Their disapproval is super obvious-ha!  I'm gonna get killed, bah-ha!
 I-I have just been promoted to  1st Class Senior Magic Knight!
 I, Sekke Bronzazza,  will fight any enemy, win,
 and take pride in protecting  the Clover Kingdom, bah-ha!
 So please spare my life.
 W-Will that be all, Your Majesty?
 Indeed! All of you should follow Sekke's  example and remember to prioritize me!
 Do you understand?!
 I-I've been saved.
 As I was saying,
 other than the present five,
 we will be promoting everyone who  participated in this battle one rank.
 I see. So that's why they  had all captains attend.
 They wouldn't usually have us all show  up just because the king is here.
 Such care for the squad members  coming from the Wizard King...
 I thank you.
 All of the Magic Knights who risked their  lives in this battle will be rewarded.
 If the current fuss over the Magic  Parliament trial hadn't been going on,
 there were squads that would've  seen many promotions.
 Though we will not be able  to promote them at this time,
 we have decided to give  them special recognition.
 Captain of the Black Bulls, Yami Sukehiro.
 What? I get something?
 Please keep the problems to a minimum,
 and continue to show results  with your teamwork.
 What? I don't get money?
 Well, thanks anyway.
 This concludes the  special decoration ceremony.
 Lastly, I would like to read a  message from the Wizard King.
 ""Our kingdom is slowly recovering from  the attack by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 but the threat of the Spade Kingdom  is just around the corner.
 I expect nothing but the best from  those who have just been promoted.
 I hope that those who did not receive  new titles will continue to train hard,
 come together as Magic Knights,
 and protect this kingdom and its people.""
 Yes, sir.
 We're back!
 Come and get me!
 Damn it! Quit running away!
 Looks like you can't keep up with me at all!
 Hey! Welcome back, Captain Yami and Finral!
 Damn, you're noisy.
 Go train outside.
 Hey, Luck!
 Huh?
 You're mine!
 You're going to the Heart Kingdom.
 Really?!
 So it's finally been decided?!
 From our squad, we've got you and Nero,
 then Finral, Luck, and Noelle.
 Finral, too?!
 Yeah...
 I get to go all-out in the Heart Kingdom!
 Sure. Go crazy, kid.
 Please...
 Please let me go, too!
 I can't just sit here if he's gonna go!
 I'll get even stronger than him!
 Look, this was already decided  at the captains' meeting.
 Sorry.
 Please! Let me go!
 He's always running ahead of me.
 But I'm a true man,  and I can't be left behind again!
 Even if you tell me not  to go, I'm going to go!
 With your mana, you're not gonna be able  to keep up unless you're prepared to die.
 You up to that?
 Yes, sir!
 Who the hell cares about  how much mana you have?!
 I'll surpass the limits of a peasant!
 Fine. I'll try asking Julius.
 Just remember this.
 What's important here isn't where you train.
 It's how you train.
 Got it?
 Yes, sir!
 You did it, Magna!
 Yeah, it wouldn't be fun if  I just kept getting stronger.
 Yeah! You bet your ass I'm gonna catch up!
 In that case, Finral, Magna, and Luck!
 Let's all do our best training  in the Heart Kingdom!
 Yeah!
 Look at you, climbing up  that ladder all at once.
 You're just so cool!
 I guess you'll become the  Wizard King in no time!
 You can't be serious. It's not that easy.
 But someday...
 Someday, for sure...
 I'm going to follow my own path  to become the Wizard King.
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 154: ""Vice Captain Langris Vaude.""

 If you're going to come at me,  you can't hold back, or you'll get hurt.

154,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 The Magic Knights Squad Captains
 held a meeting to decide who would  go train in the Heart Kingdom.
 From the Black Bulls, Asta, Nero, Luck,
 Finral, and Noelle.
 From the Golden Dawn, Mimosa.
 From the Crimson Lion Kings, Leopold.
 From the Blue Rose Knights,  Charlotte nominated herself.
 And Rill from the Aqua Deer  also nominated himself.
 These were the members who were about  to train with the Spirit Guardians.
 At the special decoration  ceremony that followed...
 Those who shone brightest in the battle  against the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 Leopold, Sol, and Mimosa, were promoted.
 Also...
 Yuno of the Golden Dawn,
 you have been promoted to  1st Class Senior Magic Knight.
 Yuno was promoted to  1st Class Senior Magic Knight.
 And then, the king decided  he had to have his way...
 With my authority as king, I give Sekke...
 the title of 1st Class Senior Magic Knight!
 F-First Class Senior Magic Knight?!
 What the bah-ha?!
 And Sekke was also promoted to  1st Class Senior Magic Knight.
 Meanwhile, there was a  member of the Black Bulls
 who was fretting over the fact that he  wasn't picked to go to the Heart Kingdom.
 Please! Let me go!
 I'm a true man,  and I can't be left behind again!
 Even if you tell me not  to go, I'm going to go!
 You up to that?
 Yes, sir!
 Who the hell cares about  how much mana you have?!
 I'll surpass the limits of a peasant!
 Fine. I'll try asking Julius.
 Back at the Golden Dawn's headquarters,
 not everyone was happy about  the fact that Yuno was
 promoted to 1st Class Senior Magic Knight...
 The Golden Dawn's Headquarters
 So Yuno's a 1st Class Senior Magic Knight now.
 That's the same rank as Vice Captain Langris.
 The kid's only been in our  squad for about a year.
 Yes, but I can't say I'm surprised,  given how powerful Yuno is.
 Vice Captain Langris hasn't been
 on a mission since what happened  with the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
 That probably means Yuno's going  to be the next vice captain.
 Everyone in our squad is  talking about that right now.
 I'm sure they are.
 Langris and Yuno...  They're both amazing mages,
 but if we're talking about who's  actually fit to be vice captain...
 V-Vice Captain Langris!
 H-Hello! Are you out for a walk?
 It is a lovely day for a walk, isn't it?
 Please enjoy!
 Farewell!
 That probably means Yuno's going  to be the next vice captain.
 Vice Captain Langris Vaude
 Don't you think it's about time?
 Time for?
 For you to resume your  duties as vice captain.
 Our battle with the Spade Kingdom draws near.
 I'd like you to watch over the squad mem—
 May I just...
 have a little more time?
 Has my brother contacted you lately?
 Look at these.
 Letters?
 Finral could just use his  spatial magic to come visit.
 But he's been regularly  delivering letters to me.
 I'm sure he believes that  distancing himself from you
 is a part of his training.
 What? Did you catch a cold?
 Looking cute again today, Noelle!
 Why don't we get some tea—
 You'll never break your  curse this way, Finral!
 So what has he been writing in his letters?
 That he'll be going to the  Heart Kingdom to train soon.
 He actually told you that?
 If he's having to go to  another kingdom to train,
 does that mean there's another  big battle drawing near?
 Huh?
 I tried asking Finral personally...
 Since, you know, he's terrible  at keeping secrets.
 Langris?
 There's nothing for you to  worry about, Miss Finnes.
 Is something on your mind?
 You're terrible at keeping secrets.
 You and Finral really are alike.
 Please don't compare me to him!
 I'm sorry.
 N-No... I should apologize.
 Are you all right?
 Yes.
 You should head back inside.  I'll take my leave, as well.
 Don't worry. It's just my usual cough.
 Well, despite how I may look,  I am rather busy.
 Oh, did you return to your  duties as vice captain, then?
 Thank you for the tea.
 Check.
 So that's your play.
 See? I told you that you  should've bet on Shiren.
 The game isn't over yet.
 Say, Yuno! Isn't today a  perfect day for a date?
 Where should we go? I'm okay with wherever.
 Hey, are you listening?
 Vice Captain Langris...
 Hey, you!
 Just because you're jealous of Yuno and me  doesn't mean you need to scowl like tha—
 Do you need something?
 I'd like to spar with you.
 You're a 1st Class Senior  Magic Knight now, aren't you?
 As another 1st Class Senior Magic Knight,  let's see if you're qualif—
 All right.
 Yuno?
 W-Wait, Yuno!
 Vice Captain Langris, I ask  that you calm down, too!
 You calm down, Klaus.
 I'm not trying to pick a fight.
 Come in.
 Please excuse me.
 Vice Captain Langris has  asked Yuno to spar with him.
 Langris did?
 I have a bad feeling about this. I hope nothing happens.
 You can count on me, Yuno!
 You don't need to hold back!
 A normal sparring session is no fun.
 How about we agree that the loser...
 leaves the Golden Dawn?
 Honestly, what a vulgar bunch.
 You should be more careful about  who you associate with, Yuno.
 Aren't you embarrassed to be seen with them?
 Why?
 I've never thought that, not even once.
 I'm proud of Asta, and he's my rival.
 Rival? That guy?
 Rival in what? Are you guys  competing for something?
 Yeah...
 We're both working to  become the Wizard King!
 What's your problem?! I won't  allow you to make fun of Yuno—
 There's no rule that says commoners  can't become the Wizard King.
 Huh?
 So first, I'll become the  Captain of the Golden Dawn.
 I see. Meaning you're completely  ignoring my existence as vice captain.
 You mentioned that before  you became the Wizard King,
 you'd become the Captain of  the Golden Dawn, didn't you?
 If you win, then I, the vice captain, will leave.
 Meaning you'll be another  step closer to captain.
 Not a bad deal, right?
 Let's just get started.
 That's like adding fuel to the fire.
 This probably won't be over quickly.
 Yes.
 There will definitely be blood.
 Who are you betting on?
 Neither!
 We must stop them.
 Then let's start... this sparring session!
 The boulder just disappeared.
 I guess talking's out of the question.
 Vice Captain Langris...
 He's not going to hold back?
 Too bad... I guess you dodged it.
 Third time's the charm!
 Wind Creation Magic: Wind Blade Shower!
 Whoops.
 What's that look for?
 I don't know what you're thinking,  but would you stop holding back?
 You think I'm holding back?
 If you were fighting seriously, you would've  been able to dodge that attack.
 And if you don't take this seriously,  you'll get hurt.
 Why must you be like that?
 Something tells me that Yuno's  not just trying to provoke him.
 What did you just say?
 Do you really need me to say it again?
 I see. So you do realize that was rude.
 In that case, I won't hold back!
 This is what he used back then!
 This is the spatial magic that
 Vice Captain Langris used at the  Royal Knights Selection Exam.
 I'll show you what happens  when I don't hold back!
 Spirit Assimilation: Spirit Dive!
 Take this!
 Mana Zone: Spirit's Hushed Dance.
 Amazing!
 Well done, Yuno!
 Spirit Storm!
 That spell is the one he was using  when he was possessed by an elf...
 The auto-defense spell!
 But he should've only been able to use  that spell under the elf's influence.
 The feeling of mana from when  I'd reincarnated as an elf
 is still faintly present.
 Now, let's see how long  you can keep dodging!
 Yuno's crown!
 It was gouged away!
 What's the matter? Are you just  going to keep running away?!
 This is the end!
 Yuno!
 What?!
 An afterimage?
 You're right. It really is the end.
 Yuno...
 He's all right.
 But that means the vice captain...
 Who did I bet on again?
 Like I'd know.
 I lose.
 What's that face for?  If you want to laugh, then laugh.
 I gave it my all, and I still lost to you.
 You only got serious in  the middle of the match.
 You intentionally tried to lose at first.
 I guess you saw right through me.
 That's right. I was going to intentionally  lose to you and leave the Golden Dawn.
 But now what?
 I actually tried, and still  pathetically lost to you.
 Who's pathetic?
 Do you really think  I won that match easily?
 That's true. Yuno...
 ...definitely didn't win easily.
 What does that matter?!
 You won, and I lost!
 Which just means I'm going  to leave the Golden Dawn.
 As promised.
 I don't remember making this prom—
 Maybe you don't, but I do.
 You can't be serious!
 Take care of the Golden Dawn for me.
 Are you seriously quitting?
 I don't feel like I've won.
 Who knows what would've happened  if you were serious from the start?
 Promise me that one day,
 you'll spar with me without holding back.
 I'm sorry I did this without  consulting you first.
 I'm not surprised.
 You didn't need to create an excuse to  leave the squad right in front of them.
 So you saw through me.
 That's just how I am.
 I know. And I know that  this isn't the end for you.
 This doesn't change the fact that  you're a member of the Golden Dawn.
 Thank you very much.
 Please excuse me.
 I'll be waiting for you, Langris.
 Langris, why are you dressed like that?
 I'm going on a journey.
 Did you really quit the Golden Dawn?
 I did not.
 I just happened to make a silly promise.
 I see...
 Good morning, Miss Finnes!
 Langris? Why are you dressed like that?
 And did you come here to see Miss Finnes
 one more time before  leaving for your training?
 Huh? Well, yeah.
 I'll be the one who makes Miss Finnes happy!
 I'll become a man worthy of you,  and then I'll come for you.
 Please try not to take too long.
 There's something I forgot to tell you both.
 I still haven't decided to  let you have Miss Finnes.
 Huh?
 Who do you think you are, Brother?
 Brother... The battle's only just begun.
 You're about to go training in the  Heart Kingdom! Eat up! Eat your fill!
 Thanks! Don't mind if I do!
 I can't eat another bite.
 Is it just you guys?
 Magna and Luck said they were going  to hold off on eating a bit longer.
 I see.
 If you guys actually see me,
 I'm sure you'll end up inviting  me to train with you, too.
 You weren't picked, so you're not going to the training
 But I plan to train under my  father and excel in curse magic,
 so I'm going back home.
 It's unfortunate, but I can't go with you.
 So I'm going to leave without being noticed.
 How can you eat so much?
 I'm going to surpass my digestive limits!
 Did someone just walk by us?
 You're just imagining things.
 Yeah?
 Mister Yami! What happened with  me going to the Heart Kingdom?
 They said they didn't mind  another one tagging along.
 Thank you so much, Mister Yami!
 If you're gonna thank someone, thank Julius.
 Hell yeah!
 Congratulations, Magna!
 Thanks, Asta!
 Man, I'm thirsty!
 What's that tasty juice from  the Heart Kingdom again?
 Tasty?!
 You mean the crimson orange juice?
 I can't wait to try that!
 If you put your mana into it,  it gets sweeter, right?
 It gets sweeter?!
 Yeah! It's just super sour for me!
 What are you complaining for?  I used my mana on yours.
 Anyway, tomorrow you'll  be in the Heart Kingdom.
 Make sure you give it your all in  training with the Spirit Guardians.
 Right!
 I'm going to become stronger...
 so that I can defeat the devil Megicula.
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 If You're Going to Quit  Being Vice Captain
 If You're Going to Quit Being Vice Captain.
 I'm sorry I did this without  consulting you first.
 If you're going to quit being vice captain,  you'll be in charge of lunch.
 In charge of lunch?!
 If you don't like that, I guess  you can be the chalkboard eraser.
 The chalkboard eraser?!
 Or maybe in charge of the school animals.
 In charge of the school animals?!
 I hate you!
 Heck yeah! Training!
 I'm gonna train! I'm gonna train!  I'm gonna train! I'm gonna train!
 Jeez, shut up, Stupidsta.
 I really hope they strengthen your brain, too.

 Now that I've sworn I'd be worthy of  being the head of the House of Vaude
 and of Miss Finnes,
 If I don't become stronger now,  it'll all be a lie.
 So the Spirit Guardians won't break  even if I go all-out, right?
 I can't wait!
 Hell yeah! I'm definitely gonna get stronger!
 Well, you can get stronger, but I'm  still gonna get even stronger than you!
 The hell'd you say?!
 To avenge my mother...  To destroy the devil Megicula...
 I'm going to become stronger!
 The 5 Spirit Guardians
 Guys, you're already here?
 Asta!
 I've been waiting for you, my rival!
 Training in another kingdom...  Yami should've come, too.
 Asta, Yuno gave me a message for you.
 Oh? What'd he say?
 Just simply, ""I'm going to become  stronger with the Golden Dawn.""
 What's that supposed to mean? He'd obviously  get stronger if he trained over here.
 Nah, he'd get stronger  no matter where he was.
 I can't lose!
 It appears that you're all here.
 Yes. Thank you for having us, Gaja.
 Then allow me to lead you in.
 There are many of you I am  meeting for the first time.
 Welcome to the Heart Kingdom.
 Normally, I would be holding a  feast to welcome all of you here,
 and it pains me deeply that  this is the best I can do,
 but considering the circumstances...
 Is something the matter?
 I do beg your pardon for bringing  this up, but the one on your lap...
 It's Charmy.
 Yeah, that much is obvious.  But what's she doing here?
 Wherever there are delicious noms,  I shall also be there!
 What the hell?
 Honestly, this is the problem  with the Black Bulls.
 But it does appear that  Queen Loropechika is okay with it.
 If the queen is allowing it,  there shouldn't be a problem.
 It seems the queen here is very generous.
 Is this actually what you'd call generous?
 It's a pleasure to have you all here, citizens of the Clover Kingdom.
 We'll be in your care for a while.
 We thank you for your kindness!
 Then let us go into a bit more  detail about your training.
 First, the Spade Kingdom has
 already taken control of most of  the bases in the Diamond Kingdom,
 and their invasion has halted for the moment.
 Which means that our kingdom, as well as
 the Clover Kingdom,  may be targeted at any time.
 And because of that,
 all of you will be undergoing rigorous  training to ensure rapid growth.
 Bring it on!
 We also wish to become more  powerful as soon as possible.
 I will now introduce the Spirit Guardians  who will be mentoring you.
 The Spirit Guardian of Earth Sarado
 The Spirit Guardian of Earth, Sarado.
 Pleased to meet you!
 The Spirit Guardian of Plants, Potrof.
 The Spirit Guardian of Plants Potrof
 Let us learn together!
 The Spirit Guardian of Fire Floga
 The Spirit Guardian of Fire, Floga.
 I have high hopes for you!
 The Spirit Guardian of Wind Smurik
 The Spirit Guardian of Wind, Smurik.
 Hey, they seem pretty intense.
 This seems fun! Who do I get to fight first?!
 Mimosa and Charlotte, please  train with Sarado first.
 Understood.
 Very well.
 Leave it to me!
 Finral, please learn from Smurik.
 Yes, sir!
 Rill, Potrof shall be your mentor.
 Yeah, sure thing!
 I'll be waiting for you in the forest!
 Leopold and Magna will be under Floga's care.
 I hope you'll train me to the fullest!
 You both seem really determined!
 I can't wait to meet you in person!
 Luck, I will be training you myself.
 As long as we get to put our lives  on the line, I don't care who it is.
 What about me? Who's gonna be training me?
 You do not have any mana whatsoever.
 We may be Spirit Guardians, but we  cannot make mana grow from nothing.
 Huh?! Then why the heck did I come here?!
 But you are one of the mages
 at the arcane stage, who could  possibly defeat the devil.
 I would like you to spar with me  so I can gauge your strength.
 We will figure out the details after that.
 Spar with you? Okay, got it!
 As for the other mage at  the arcane stage, Nero...
 I will be training her myself.
 The queen will be training Nero personally?
 I look forward to working with you, Nero.
 And as for Noelle,  Undine and I will be training you.
 Let's do our best.
 Yes, all right.
 This covers the assignments for the training.
 Hang on a second!
 What is it, Magna?
 Is there any way I can continue going  at it with Luck and train under you?
 Very well.
 Hell yeah!
 Aw, sure. But do you think you'll  be able to keep up with me?
 Of course I can!
 The rest of you, as well, are not bound  permanently to the assignments I have chosen.
 Once your mana grows a bit, please move  on to a different Spirit Guardian.
 That will help you learn as much as possible.
 Now then, everyone, I look forward to  working with all of you for a while.
 Right!
 Magna uses flame magic,  and Luck uses lightning magic.
 If natural magic attributes work better  with the Heart Kingdom's techniques,
 then these two are perfect, aren't they?
 Essentially, yes.
 First, I will show you how to make  mana words with natural mana.
 The hell is that?!
 Without this, you cannot  create this technique.
 By creating a technique using mana words,
 you can add simple orders to spells.
 For example...
 Please dodge.
 Like this?
 Just like that, it means  we are able to give it
 orders like ""chase him"" or ""become bigger.""
 That's awesome!
 Huh...
 All right! Let's do this!
 Plants grow from the earth.
 In order to strengthen plant magic,  you start with the earth.
 I somewhat understand what you're saying...
 So you're telling us to understand the earth.
 It's probably quicker to show  you than try to explain it.
 So this is the Heart Kingdom's technique.
 Though our magic attributes are different,
 we're in the same boat when it  comes to understanding nature.
 If you can master this, your magic  will instantly power up!
 That's rather surprising. One of my  subordinates uses similar magic,
 but yours is much faster and more powerful.
 From the looks of it, you all  just rely on your own mana,
 and can't use natural mana at all.
 So you're telling us to become able to do that.
 And how do we do that?
 You just gather it, like ""swoosh,"" from  a huge area, and bam, you're all set.
 Um, could you be more specific, please?
 You just sense mana, like, ""ding, ding, ding.""
 Once you feel it, you've just  gotta go whoosh and swoosh.
 Then we can talk about technique.
 That's far too vague...
 He seems a bit different.
 The wind that comes down  from the mountains,
 the wind that rises from the ocean...
 All the wind passes through this valley.
 I see. So that's why the  wind is so strong here.
 I was looking forward to the arrival  of the boy chosen by the Wind Spirit.
 Oh, you mean Asta's rival.
 But you came to me instead. I'm sure  there must be a deep meaning behind that.
 I mean, I think Gaja decided that, but...
 Now, what will you do?
 Is this training?
 Has our training already begun?
 Whether this is training or not, the wind  that blows between us does not change.
 Isn't that right?
 I can't seem to figure this  guy out. Is he really okay?
 Spatial magic's main purpose  is to support your friends.
 Isn't that what you think?
 Yes... and?
 Then if someone targets you, do you  just expect your friends to save you?
 Does that truly make you a supporter?
 What you must do is not  necessarily just one thing.
 Crap!
 Well, what now?
 Please continue!
 Very well. Anywhere the wind blows.
 What a beautiful day!  A perfect day for training.
 I look forward to working with you, Floga!
 First, let's see your magic.
 About 80% of your power is enough.
 Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!
 Nice. If this is what you can do at 80%,  you've got a fair bit of potential.
 No, this is nowhere near enough.
 I must learn much more  and become even stronger.
 I don't want this chance to go to waste.
 Agreed.
 I realize I may come off  as rude when I say this,
 but I'd like to see your powers.
 Mine?
 I want to see with my own eyes  whether I can learn anything from you.
 Ah, so that's what you mean.  Well, in that case...
 I think that about does it.
 I apologize for doubting your strength.
 Don't worry about it.
 It was so intense... I want to  make that intensity my own!
 Your potential is far greater than mine.
 Once you learn how to use natural mana,
 it won't be that difficult  for you to do what I just did.
 You're on the right track.
 But it's not easy getting  full control of natural mana.
 I look forward to working with you, Floga!
 You've gotta push harder, Magna!
 Your magic is far too weak, after all.
 What?!
 You're around the fifth stage.
 To use these techniques in battle,  you need to be third stage or higher.
 What the heck is this? It's super fun!
 It appears that he has a knack for this.
 Guess I'm just gonna get  stronger on my own, then.
 Magna...
 Just leave him alone, Asta.
 If he can't get any stronger,
 it just means that's all he's worth.
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 As I stated earlier, I'm going  to measure your strength.
 Please come at me with everything you have.
 I get to fight someone who's almost  on a par with the Wizard King!
 Let's have a good match!
 I think this is a good spot.
 So what are we going to do for training?
 We're going to bask in the natural mana.
 Plants and animals...
 The earth, water, wind, sunlight...  This place is rich with life,
 so it's also overflowing with mana.
 Now that you mention it,  I think I can feel that.
 And don't ever forget that feeling.
 You need mana words to create the  techniques we use in the Heart Kingdom.
 You'll be able to use mana words as you please
 once you become one with natural mana.
 Wow!
 I can feel something welling up inside me
 after seeing you use your magic like this.
 Then why not try using mana  words as your heart desires?
 It probably won't go perfectly as  planned at first, but that's fine.
 All right.
 Er, that's not quite right.  You need to use mana words—
 I feel the need to create  welling up within me!
 Uh... I see that you're an excellent painter,  so why not try writing mana words?
 Mana words... like this.
 Like this?
 My painting!
 Unbelievable.
 You were able to write that many mana  words after seeing them just once...
 Rill, keep that up.
 No, don't go painting again!
 Thanks for your help. I think this painting  is going to be even better for it.
 Oh, for crying out loud!
 Hey, you're from the Black Bulls...
 Aren't you Queen Loropechika's pet...  er, I mean, guest?
 Weren't you enjoying a  meal back at the palace?
 Well, I ate all the food there,  so I came here in search for new foods, la.
 You're telling me you've depleted  all of the palace's reserves?
 Yup.
 Well, since you came all the  way to the Heart Kingdom,
 why not learn the Heart Kingdom's techniques?
 Well, right now, I just want to eat  as many delicious noms as I can.
 Oh, don't be like that. See, look.  These are mana words.
 They're really convenient to be able to use.
 Ah! Looks like we have  another genius on our hands!
 But it's not complete just yet.
 Listen well. You use mana  words and natural mana to...
 I think there's even more delicious  fruit further in the forest.
 If we go further into the forest,
 I'm sure I'll find some scenery  that'll spark my inspiration!
 I'm begging you two, please listen to me.
 Now, let's have you train us,  Loropechika and Undine.
 Of course. But first,  I have a request for you two.
 Please save me.
 As things stand, this curse will kill me.
 Before that happens...
 We know. We'll defeat the  devil before that happens.
 That's why we're all here to train.
 The four of us here will strike  down the devil Megicula.
 Could you explain what you mean?
 Of course, we will need  everyone else's help in order
 to stop the invasion from the Spade Kingdom.
 But Megicula... The one that  Megicula possesses, the mage Vanica...
 We don't stand a chance
 against that one unless Undine and I,  as well as the two of you, join forces.
 And you know how this Vanica fights.  That's why you're saying that.
 My duty is to fight alongside  Loropechika, as well as protect her.
 But the two of us were no match for Vanica.
 It's my fault that Loropechika has to  deal with the fear of impending death.
 No, it's not your fault, Undine.
 Those possessed by the devil cannot  be defeated by ordinary means.
 So you're saying if you have  Nero and me with you,
 we'll be able to win using  unconventional means.
 We can't be certain just yet.
 But I've come to the conclusion that  if the four of us work together,
 we may come closest to that result.
 Please... help us so that  we can save Loropechika.
 Nero's arcane stage...
 Noelle's combative spirit  and fighting style...
 If you two grow along with Undine and me,
 we should be able to defeat Vanica,  as well as Megicula, who possesses her.
 I'll believe you.
 Nero, you're doing this, too.
 Thank you.
 You don't need to thank us.
 I have my own reasons for wanting to  defeat Megicula with my own hands.
 Very well. Then let us begin.
 All right! Come at me from wherever!
 You've got the right idea.
 But if you can't figure out your  opponent's powers, there's no point.
 This isn't good. At this rate,  I won't be able to support my friends!
 Keep zooming at me!  Keep using those mana words!
 Then you'll eventually get the hang of it!
 This time, I'll get you!
 The power to nullify magic is unrivaled.
 But your vision is so narrow that you can't  use your powers to their full potential.
 Not yet!
 Solely relying on how tough  you are in your fighting style
 will not keep working forever.
 To use those powers to their full potential,
 it's only logical that you use  them to back up your friends.
 Please let me try again!
 I guess you won't be satisfied with that.
 Yeah, they're working me  to the bone from day one.
 Not just me. All of us!
 So, are you seeing any progress?
 It looks like everyone else has already  learned the Heart Kingdom's techniques,
 so I think it's unlikely that we won't get  stronger if we keep this up every day.
 Oh? Well, keep up the good work.
 Yes, sir!
 Looks like they're all trying  to surpass their limits.
 So I guess I need to work a bit harder, too.
 Everyone's gone out training, so the  Black Bulls' hideout is super quiet.
 Next time on Black Clover,  Page 156: ""Awakening Powers.""

 Guess I should push harder, too.
 And no, I don't mean in the bathroom.

156,"The Clover Kingdom.
 In this kingdom where magic is everything,
 there is one boy who can't use magic.
 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,
 or even if you're poor...
 Anyone in this world can still shine!
 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 In order to learn the Mana Method  and acquire new powers,
 Asta and the others train their  hardest in the Heart Kingdom.
 This time, I'll get you!
 The power to nullify magic is unrivaled.
 But your vision is so narrow that you can't  use your powers to their full potential.
 Not yet!
 And this man was making his move, too.
 Looks like they're all trying  to surpass their limits.
 So I guess I need to work a bit harder, too.
 Awakening Powers
 Lightning Magic: Tenjiolia.
 I've been sparring with him for days now,  and I still can't get a hit in!
 If I wasn't holding back,  you'd be in far worse shape.
 The extremely rare power known as anti-magic,
 physical strength that you've trained  to your limit, and your friends
 are what have led you to victory thus far.
 But the enemy we're about  to face is far too powerful.
 If you cannot defeat me on your own,  you will not be able to defeat the devil.
 Please let me have another try!
 Is it his unwavering willpower that  has strengthened him to this point?
 No, it's not just him.
 Some of the mages who came  from the Clover Kingdom
 have already started creating  techniques of their own.
 Faster... I need to be faster.
 I need to be stronger!
 Leopold...
 I know I should be able to do more... More!
 Those were great moves, Leo.
 You're able to use the  Mana Method faster now, too.
 It's just...
 Hmm, how do I put this?
 Every now and then, you seem to  waver a bit when you're fighting.
 It feels like something's making you hesitate.
 Is there a reason why?
 I have an older brother and  an older sister that I look up to.
 Their strength is burned into  my eyes. I cannot unsee it.
 The stronger I become,
 the more I realize how much higher  up my brother and sister are.
 Stand up.
 Lions should never look so pitiful.
 The more powerful I get, the more  out of reach they seem to become.
 No matter how hard I try, I can't help  but think that they're stronger than me.
 Flame Magic: Calidos Brachium!
 Man, it's hot.
 Heya, Sisgoleon.
 Who are you calling Sisgoleon, you fool?
 Did you come for a dip in the hot springs, too?
 Why not go defeat one of the magical  beasts around here while you're at it?
 Jeez, were you fighting so you  could enjoy a nice, long bath?
 You sure are violent, aren't ya?
 Hah. I couldn't even call this a warmup.
 I'm sure you couldn't.
 So in that case...
 How about fighting me?
 Oh? What brought this on?
 Yeah, about that.
 In that last battle with the devil,
 I was able to use the Mana Zone  or whatever it's called.
 But I still don't really get it,  and I think I could take it a bit further,
 so I wanted to give it a try.
 Give it a try? With me?
 Well, you're more experienced  with Mana Zone, aren't you?
 Help a newbie out, will ya?
 Very well. I was just thinking  I hadn't had enough.
 But are you sure about this?  Before you even get to try,
 your body might not even hold up!
 Yikes. Not only is she ready,  she's ready to kill me.
 Yeah, I'm going home. Sorry to bug you.
 I guess that's not gonna work, is it?
 Looks like you're ready  to be devoured by a lion.
 Then again, if you don't come at me like that,
 I won't be able to surpass my limits, either.
 As you wish, I'll burn you to a crisp!
 Black Meteorite!
 Is he tracking my mana?
 In that case...
 Ow...
 If I can figure out how your technique works,
 I can figure out many ways to deal with it.
 Would you like to continue fighting until  you cannot use your anti-magic anymore?
 What the heck am I supposed to do?
 How do I get my anti-magic to reach him?
 Mana and anti-magic...
 They are fundamentally different,
 but the power to create  and the power to nullify
 are similar in that they  are both a form of power.
 Which means the way to use them  shouldn't be that different, either.
 The basic technique in using the Mana Method
 is to feel the flow of mana.
 Which means the thing you  need to do right now...
 ...is to feel the flow of anti-magic!
 She's faster than my ki can track.
 Is that all you've got?
 You can't win if you just keep running away!
 How the hell is she so fast?!
 But if that's also
 thanks to Mana Zone,  I should be able to do it, too!
 Too slow!
 Here, get an up-close feel for what  you can really do with Mana Zone!
 Well... what to do?
 Hot! Hot!
 I guess I should've expected  that from the Mana Zone expert.
 She's definitely something else.
 I guess you're as crazy as ever,  you violent lioness.
 There's no fun in catching weak prey.
 Try struggling more!
 If we're just fighting with speed,  I'm definitely at a disadvantage.
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade!
 Black Divider!
 He disappeared?!
 So you're trying to make your  blade longer to reach me.
 But you're too slow.
 Even if I can sense him with  my ki, I can't keep up.
 As long as I use the Mana Method  to increase my speed,
 I'll have no problem dodging.
 The mages of the Heart Kingdom
 borrow power from natural mana.
 Depending on the level of their Mana Method,
 they will have unlimited use of their mana.
 Which means that so long as your attacks  don't reach me, my mana is limitless.
 If I keep using up my anti-magic,  I'm going to lose.
 What was that?
 This is pathetic.
 Before the devil has a chance to end you,
 I wouldn't mind giving you  your last rites here and now.
 I'm already grateful that you're  helping me out with my training.
 There's no need for you to do that, too.
 I guess I can't even get in the  ring with you unless I can use
 that superhuman walking-through-the-air bit.
 Think... I need to figure out  an attack that can reach him,
 but one that's fast enough so he can't dodge!
 I've now seen the powers of the Demon-Slayer  Sword and the Demon-Destroyer Sword.
 Does that sword have some  special power, too?
 That's right. The Demon-Dweller Sword...
 It must have some power  that I haven't drawn out yet.
 That reminds me. Back then,
 I was able to unleash the mana  that I borrowed from Noelle.
 I might be able to do the same  thing with my anti-magic!
 It appears as though  you've found your answer.
 I'd like another try, please!
 Very well.
 I won't be holding back  as much on this attack.
 If you can hit me even once,  I will declare you the winner.
 I'd prefer if you didn't hold back at all!
 If you're not going to  make a move, then I will!
 And now, I'm gonna kick the air!
 Lions hurl even their young  into bottomless valleys.
 I'll have no problem hurling you into the lava!
 Are you seriously chasing me right now?!
 But, I mean... Sisgoleon's right.
 If I lose here...
 I'm not gonna stand a chance against a devil!
 Oh?
 Guess we're finally on equal ground.
 Equal ground? What are you babbling about?
 I'm just saying we're in  the same position now!
 You're a babe who just learned  how to walk! Know your place!
 I've gotta do something  about that superhuman punch.
 Just like when I borrowed  Noelle's mana last time...
 I need to infuse the Demon-Dweller  Sword with my anti-magic!
 Now, as you wish, I will  show you my true strength.
 I just need to keep increasing  my speed with Mana Zone,
 and not give her a chance to use magic!
 I see. Looks like you can  use Mana Zone somewhat now.
 I guess there's no reason for  me to hold back any longer.
 You actually thought you were  holding back? Seriously?
 I'll now thank you for  showing me a good time.
 Try not to die from it.
 Can I actually stop all of that?
 Well, I'm gonna have to!
 Don't doubt that you can do this!
 You're just gonna have to!
 Right here, right now...  I'm gonna surpass my limits!
 Mana Zone: Dark Magic: Black Hole!
 This is...
 Is he nullifying my mana?
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!
 There!
 Well done.
 Heck yeah! I got a hit in!
 Things are finally getting interesting!
 I'll turn you into ash and  enjoy a nice, long bath!
 Nah, I got the gist of it, so I'm gonna go.
 What? Are you scared?
 Anyway, see ya.
 Well, that's no fun.
 If you'll now begin your reports. Potrof?
 Rill and Charmy are getting the  hang of using the Mana Method.
 They're geniuses, to be honest.
 The best thing I can do is  help bring out their potential
 and prepare their meals.
 Huh... Charlotte and Mimosa are amazing, too.
 They're fighting like, ""kaboom,""  and getting better like, ""fabam""!
 If we're talking about  how much they've grown,
 I'd say Noelle and Nero have grown the most.
 Of course, they are being trained by the
 Queen of the Heart Kingdom  and the Water Spirit,
 so of course they're going to get stronger.
 Looks like you're proud of your students.
 Smurik, how is Finral doing?
 For the time being, let the wind guide us
 and help us nurture the storm within him.
 You can never just get to the point, can you?
 Did you say something?
 I couldn't hear you over  the whispers of the wind.
 N-Now, now...
 Floga, how about you?
 It appears that Leo is  doubting his own strength.
 Why not concentrate on your strengths?
 My... strengths?
 You may not be the most talented,  but you're patient and don't give up.
 Your technique is getting  more powerful every day.
 You have the strength to endure.
 You're you, remember, Leo?
 The strength... to endure?
 I want to draw out potential  that he hasn't realized yet.
 That's my idea.
 Yes, I'm counting on you.
 How's Asta doing?
 Since he wields anti-magic, he is  our trump card against the devil.
 It appears as though he's becoming  stronger in his own way.
 We don't have much more time.
 Please focus everything  you have on this training.
 Yes, Your Majesty.
 Let us defeat the Spade  Kingdom and the devil.
 Spade Kingdom Garrison
 There are so many of them.
 Their preparations for the invasion are almost  complete. We don't have much more time.
 That's...
 Rejoice! You will contribute to  the prosperity of the Spade Kingdom!
 Hey, where are we going?
 Shh! Quiet!
 Come on, now! Get up!
 We can't go out there right now, Ralph.
 I know.
 If we can get through that strong  magic region, and even one of us
 can reach the Clover Kingdom...
 That's the little hope we have left.
 We'll just have to hang on to that!
 Let's go!
 Hello, foolish rebels.
 Your friend told us all about you...
 in exchange for their  precious daughter's life.
 Let's make a break for it!
 I'll move up the ranks if  I bring back your head!
 It's that simple.
 Ralph?!
 Ralph!
 What are you—
 We leave you with our mana.
 Please, Ralph...
 For him...
 You must follow in your father's footsteps...
 You're not getting away!
 Go!
 I promise I'll get there!
 I'll get to them...
 Just beyond this cliff  is a strong magic region.
 Will I be able to get through?
 No...
 I can't let their sacrifice go to waste.
 I am my father's son!
 I will see this through!
 There he is!
 Get him!
 I cannot be defeated here.
 Lord Yuno!
 Did we do it?
 I'm not sure.
 But even if he's still alive,  that's a strong magic region.
 It won't be long before he perishes.
 Yeah.
 Foolish Resistance. Serves them right.
 Let's head back.
 We're too close to the strong magic region.
 Who knows what will happen  if we hang around too long?
 Yeah.
 Spade Castle
 The son of the former commander of  the Mage Defense Force's 1st Division?
 Yes. According to what another  one of the rebel scum told us,
 apparently his name is Ralph.
 His name appears in—
 It doesn't matter.
 A single fly isn't going to  bring any harm to our plans.
 Who am I, you ask? I guess I wouldn't mind telling you a little about me.

 In this kingdom where magic is everything,

 His name is Asta.
 With guts and hard work,  he made it into the Magic Knights,
 and he never gave up,  despite how much he got hurt.
 He continues to diligently aim for the top!
 Even if you are a peasant,

 He's working hard to prove that,
 and to become the Wizard King!
 In preparation for the upcoming  battle with the Spade Kingdom,
 Asta and the others train  diligently in the Heart Kingdom.
 With their training period halfway over,
 Noelle and the others learned the  Mana Method and were growing steadily.
 Since Asta had no magic,  he fought with Gaja in order
 to obtain hints toward a new technique.
 Back in the Clover Kingdom, Yami finally  learned the trick to using Mana Zone.
 And now...
 Gaja!
 I'm back!
 It appears that you've grown yet  again in these past few days.
 Yup!
 Yesterday, I sparred with  the Wind Spirit Guardian
 and trained my ki to be able to  read ambiguous attacks better.
 Today, I fought with the Earth Spirit  Guardian who has keen senses
 to polish my own fighting instincts like ""bam!""
 Aren't you training with Luck today?
 He said he wanted to train with other  Spirit Guardians, so he is elsewhere.
 Perfect timing, then!
 I'd like to spar with you  right now, if that's okay!
 Of course, that's perfectly fine.
 But before we start, may I ask you something?
 Since you have no magic at all, your existence is quite abnormal,
 even among those at the arcane stage.
 I am constantly astounded by your growth.
 In order to further increase your strength  in the future, may I ask you...
 about your life up until this point,
 and about the devil that resides  within your grimoire?
 About me... and the devil?
 Five-Leaf Clover
 According to Father,
 me and my childhood friend Yuno were taken in
 on the same day at a church in Hage Village,  on the outskirts of the Clover Kingdom.
 Time passed, and...
 Sister Lily!
 Marry me!
 I was living with my  beloved Sister Lily, Yuno,
 and everyone else back at the church.
 But I couldn't use a lick of magic.
 Meanwhile, Yuno was a super-handsome genius.
 I'll get a grimoire that's more  amazing than anyone else's,
 get into the Magic Knights, follow in your footsteps,
 and become the Wizard King!
 And in March, those turning fifteen  were gathered from all over the kingdom
 to receive their grimoires.
 But...
 Um...
 My grimoire's not coming.
 Er...
 Try again next year.
 What?!
 What the heck?!
 That's actually amazing!
 Yuno ended up getting a four-leaf grimoire,  just like the first Wizard King.
 I thought that once I got my grimoire,
 I'd be able to use magic, but...
 I never thought I wouldn't even get one.
 But... like hell I'm gonna give up!
 Don't you dare underestimate me, fate!
 I'll show you!
 Even if it takes one, two,  ten, or a hundred years!
 I'll keep working hard  until I get my grimoire!
 But then this thieving jerk who wanted to
 sell the four-leaf grimoire  for money attacked Yuno.
 Hey, that pendant looks like  it's worth something, too.
 I guess I'll be taking that...
 Hold it!
 I tried to get back Yuno's grimoire, but my  training just wasn't enough against the thief.
 And of course, I was born with no magic.
 I found out that no matter how hard  I tried, I still couldn't use magic.
 You can't do a thing in this world.  Just give up on everything.
 You were born a loser!
 He's right.
 No matter how hard I try,  some things just can't be helped.
 I'm just going to give...
 Hey!
 Who are you calling a loser?
 Asta, it's true that you won't be  able to become the Wizard King,
 no matter what.
 You hear that? Even your little friend  is telling you it's impossible.
 That's because I'm going  to become the Wizard King!
 What?
 He's no loser.
 He's...
 Asta's my rival!
 Huh?
 Him? Your rival?
 This brat who has no  magical power whatsoever?
 Not... Not yet.
 Sorry you had to see me  looking that pathetic, Yuno.
 Just a sec...
 I'm gonna kick this guy's butt!
 And that was when
 the five-leaf grimoire, which was said
 to have a devil residing within it,  appeared before me.
 Back then, I didn't know anything about  the devil's powers or anti-magic.
 I just frantically brandished my sword.
 That's what happened when  I first got this grimoire.
 After that, Yuno and I went to
 the royal capital to take the  Magic Knights Entrance Exam.
 Yuno ended up joining the most popular  and powerful squad, the Golden Dawn.
 I was about to be disqualified  since I had no magic, but then,
 Captain Yami from the Black Bulls took me in.
 If I remember correctly,
 that captain is another Magic Knight  who uses a sword, just like yourself.
 Yeah! He takes forever to poop,  but he's super reliable when we need him!
 He's super strong and showed  me how to use my ki.
 Anyway, he's someone I super-duper respect!
 The rest of the Black Bulls also  acknowledged me as a part of the squad.
 Once I officially became a squad member,  I went on a mission to explore a dungeon
 and ended up getting my second sword,  the Demon-Dweller Sword.
 During that mission,
 we faced off with one of the Diamond  Kingdom's Eight Shining Generals, Mars,
 an insanely strong guy who used two magical attributes.
 And that was when we  coincidentally found out...
 I don't have any magic,
 but I've got...
 my friends!
 I borrowed mana from Noelle and released  it using the Demon-Dweller Sword,
 and was able to break  through Mars's tough armor.
 After that, when we reported  back about the mission,
 we met the Wizard King.
 ""Gain merit. You can't  protect anyone with pride,
 and trust will come after merit.""
 With the Wizard King's words in my heart,
 I kept fighting to protect everyone!
 But then we ran into him...
 I guess I haven't introduced myself yet.
 I am the leader of the Eye  of the Midnight Sun...
 Licht.
 His light magic was way too fast.
 I couldn't react or even track it with my eyes.
 But then Captain Yami arrived,
 and he faced him head-on.  The lightning-fast light magic
 didn't bother him at all.
 Of course, I already knew  he was super strong,
 but I got to see how powerful  he was again firsthand.
 Hey, brat. Were you watching that?
 Y-Yes, sir!
 Good. Now try the same thing.
 Yes, sir!
 Wait... Like I could actually do that!
 Of course I can't!
 Oh? Who do you think you're talking to?
 Huh?
 I told you to do it, so do it.
 Ow, ow, ow, that really hurts! Ow, ow, ow!
 That'll make you a bigger man.
 Captain Yami said he could react to the attacks  because he could sense something called ""ki.""
 People looking at you, the sound of their breathing,
 Ki
 their smell, the motions of their muscles,
 the vague sense that they're there...
 Ki is the blanket term for all of  the different types of life energy
 the human body emits.
 I read that ki and predicted  his next move, then made mine.
 You've done that before, haven't you?
 Come to think of it...
 The lesson was so intense that  I could've died doing it,
 but because of that, I learned to sense ki!
 I see.
 This ""ki"" is the best fighting technique  you could use, since you cannot use magic.
 Perhaps he anticipated that it could  be useful to you as you continue
 to use your anti-magic.
 Actually, now that you mention it...
 Holy crap! That's super  likely with Captain Yami!
 Though I may simply be  overthinking the matter.
 Way to go, Captain Yami!
 By the way, I would like  to ask another question.
 How are you able to put yourself in the  state in which you bring out the power
 of the devil that is possessing you?
 Oh, that...
 The first time I took on that form was
 when we went to visit the Queen  of Witches in the Witches' Forest.
 I fought that Diamond Kingdom  guy with the annoying smirk
 when he attacked the forest.
 Never giving up...
 is my magic!
 Damn it!
 Why?!
 My magic's supposed to be invincible now!
 Back then, I wasn't even  sure what happened myself.
 Shit!
 Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Shit!
 Why?!
 I got this far by kicking everyone else down!
 Why are you...
 You might've kicked people down,
 but everyone that helped boost me up
 makes me strong!
 Black Meteorite!
 The first time I was able to  willfully take that form was
 when we went to the Yultim Volcano in  a strong magic region for a training camp.
 Since I couldn't use Mana Skin,  a technique to envelop
 your body with mana to protect yourself,
 I couldn't move a step further  due to the intense heat.
 But then I realized that
 if I used the ki technique  I learned from Captain Yami,
 I could amplify the anti-magic within me
 and possibly pull off an  effect like Mana Skin.
 And that was also a way for me  to get into that state at will.
 Thank you so much, Captain Yami!
 I don't know what I would've done if  you'd never taught me how to use ki!
 My third sword, the Demon-Destroyer Sword,  is a bit of a wild one,
 but the reason I was able to use it  immediately is because of my ki!
 I hear that sword can nullify  not only magic itself,
 but the effects of a spell, as well.
 Yup!
 I got my hands on the Demon-Destroyer Sword
 around the time we infiltrated
 the Eye of the Midnight Sun's base  before our final battle with them!
 But suddenly, that Disloyal guy  as well as some of our friends
 reincarnated as elves and attacked us.
 And then we ended up fighting
 the leader of the elves in  the center of their base.
 This ki...
 There's incredible magic  coming from that sword.
 Oh, crap... My black form  is reaching its limit.
 Please... Just last a little longer.
 Asta, be careful.
 Yeah, I know!
 Asta!
 The leader of the elves was the  original owner of my swords,
 so he was able to use them  to their full capacity.
 And above all, he was insanely strong. But...
 Not yet!
 Yuno is my...
 Asta is my...
 ...rival!
 We couldn't win,
 but next thing I knew, the Demon-Destroyer  Sword I took was inside my grimoire.
 Because of this, I was able
 to nullify the poison magic that was  used on the people of Hage Village
 and return everyone who had reincarnated  into elves back to normal.
 After that, in the Shadow Palace,
 the memories that the Demon-Destroyer  had absorbed flooded into me.
 That's when I learned
 why the elves and humans started  hating each other so long ago.
 And the one who had reincarnated the  elves and caused all this fighting was...
 that devil.
 Word Soul Magic...
 ""Voizuiinemidoren...""
 His goal was to leave the other world  where all the other devils were
 and appear in this world  in his complete form.
 I couldn't let that bastard have his way.
 If Yuno could evolve, then so could I!
 Anti-Magic Demon-Slayer Sword:  Black Divider!
 Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash ~ Equinox!
 Nero used her Sealing Magic  to seal the damage I took.
 Asta...
 You're going to be...
 You're going to be the Wizard King, right?
 Yeah!
 Right here, right now...
 I'll surpass my limits!
 And, well, you know the rest.
 I was put on trial for being devil-possessed,
 and since I was released without indictment,
 I came to the Heart Kingdom
 to find clues to prove that I'm innocent.
 And that's where I found out  that Queen Loropechika
 had also been cursed by a devil.
 I'm going to get even stronger!
 So that I can protect everyone  in the Clover Kingdom,
 and everyone in the Heart Kingdom, too!
 I am glad I was able to hear your tale.
 I think I may understand why you  were able to become so powerful,
 even though you have no mana.
 Now, let us begin.
 The sun will go down soon,
 but I will train with you  until you are satisfied today.
 Right!
 Wow, that was amazing, Noelle!
 Not bad. You've definitely  improved since you first arrived.
 Hmph. O-Of course I have.
 I'm royalty, you know.
 Squee! Yay! I got praised!
 But you're truly amazing,  Water Spirit Undine.
 You just keep drawing out more  and more of my water magic.
 You're not the only one growing, you know.
 Please take a look at this.
 It's not just you or Nero.
 Asta and the others are also
 growing every day much faster  than we ever could've imagined.
 But still, this is nowhere near enough
 to defeat the devil from the Spade Kingdom.
 Right?
 Yes. You are exactly right.
 But I believe in all of you.
 All of you who are training  so diligently here,
 and everyone back at the Clover  Kingdom getting ready for battle...
 If we all work together,
 I'm sure we will see a ray of hope  in our fight against the devil
 within the Spade Kingdom.
 No, I'm sure we'll win!
 And I'll avenge my mother, too!
 The same trick will not work again.
 That technique is only good enough to land  a surprise attack on the enemy right now.
 I believe our session has come to an end.
 Lightning Magic: Tenjiolia.
 Not yet!
 The three leaves of the clover  represent faith, hope, and love.
 Within a fourth leaf dwells good luck.
 Within a fifth leaf...
 resides a devil.
 But my swords...
 What's going...
 You continue to surprise me.
 In order to see the extent  of your hidden powers,
 I will attack you with everything I have.
 Bring it on!
 Well, things are getting interesting now.
 Our training's finished, and it's finally  time to fight the Spade Kingdom.
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 158:  ""The Beginning of Hope and Despair.""

 Back off!
 I can't die in a place like this!
 Not until I tell him.
 The Beginning of Hope and Despair
 The giant mobile fortress, Candelo,
 created to cross the strong magic region...
 Isn't it just the best?
 But this low-stage trash  sure does run out of mana fast.
 We just need half of them to survive until  we get out of the strong magic region.
 There is mana within life energy.
 Get every last drop of mana from them, even if it's from a child.
 Thank you for responding  to the sudden summons.
 There's no need for formality, Loropechika.
 Noelle Silva
 More importantly, the Spade Kingdom's  army is drawing nearer, isn't it?
 Yes. They will soon reach  our kingdom's borders.
 Within the last six months,  the Spade Kingdom has
 basically taken over the Diamond Kingdom,
 and is now advancing toward the  Clover Kingdom and the Heart Kingdom.
 Leopold Vermillion
 We were also preparing for an attack,
 but it seems they've gotten ahead of us.
 Luck Voltia
 I'm ready to fight whenever.
 Yes. I'd like all of you to intercept them,
 but the Spade Kingdom's forces are  currently in the strong magic region.
 Finral Roulacase
 I guess timing will be really important.
 They might be easier to fight  if we draw them closer to us.
 If they're going through  the strong magic region,
 they should be weakened by the  time they reach the border.
 Mimosa Vermillion
 That will be the moment to strike.
 Actually, it's rather likely their  forces will not be weakened.
 They are heading here in a mobile fortress.
 A mobile fortress?
 They use those in their kingdom who  are at a lower stage in a vile fashion...
 as energy to move this fortress.
 Hey!
 We're still in the middle  of our strategy meeting.
 What shall we do? Should we bring  him back for the time being?
 No. Let us have him break  through the front lines.
 I'm quite certain that he  will not be defeated easily.
 The ones who see results from this training
 should only be those loved by mana and those in the higher stages
 who can use the techniques.
 But to think he, someone with no magic,
 would get so much stronger  after training with us.
 The fact that he's at the  arcane stage was surprising,
 but even more surprising  was his hard work, gutsiness,
 and strength to never give up.
 And done.
 All right, so who's next?
 Make sure you carry the fallen to the back.
 P-Please! She's still small  and barely has any mana!
 Please have mercy!
 Oh?
 You have some nerve, trying to talk to us.
 You're nothing but low-stage scum.
 You low-stage trash who can barely  manage attack magic can only be useful
 by contributing your measly  mana to move this fortress!
 If you don't wanna get hurt,  don't get any funny ideas.
 You guys are blessed, really.
 You won't be killed until all your mana's gone.
 All right.
 You get to play a special little role.
 N-No!
 Sis!
 Someone as low-class as you will actually  be of use to me. You should be honored!
 Huh?
 Man... what's with this crazy weather?
 Well, that's a strong magic region for you.
 Guess I don't have full  control over it yet. Damn!
 Demon-Slayer!
 All right!
 That robe... You must be a Magic Knight  from the Clover Kingdom.
 What are you doing here?
 What's with this guy?  He doesn't have any mana at all!
 Hey, come on, now!
 He came here by himself? What an idiot.
 I don't know why you showed up,  but you're just wasting your time!
 I'll finish you off in an instant!
 You piece of trash!
 Wha—
 Wasting time? That's my line.
 I don't know how many of you there are,  but I'll take care of you in an instant.
 So all of you can come at me at once!
 You brat!
 Who do you think you are?
 I'm one of the Clover Kingdom's Magic Knights, Asta of the Black Bulls!
 I won't harm any of you!
 Don't worry! You're safe now!
 We're only being left alive... so that  our mana can keep this fortress moving.
 Her heart is... frightened?
 We can never leave this place.
 Even if we were to be freed,  we couldn't escape this strong magic region.
 Why did this happen?  We don't want this war.
 Who's the one making these  people suffer like this?
 The captain in charge of this  fortress has an eerie magic.
 He has some otherworldly, frightful power.
 All right.
 In that case, I'm gonna go beat  down all the bad guys here.
 What?! But that's impossible!
 There are still so many soldiers, and...
 Don't worry!
 Are you the intruder?!
 You won't get away!
 Demon-Dweller!
 Black Slash!
 So you're up there, huh?
 What the?!
 Why, you—
 Die!
 Take this!
 Who the hell are you?!
 Hup!
 You must be here.
 Well, you sure made a mess of things.
 It appears you also have the power of a devil.
 How can you do something so  awful to your own people?
 My people? Something awful?
 They're merely sacrificing themselves  so that the Spade Kingdom can prosper.
 I don't know of anything more honorable  that the lower-stage filth could do.
 Your people aren't filth!
 M-My body—
 I don't know how trash like you who doesn't have any mana
 managed to get your hands  on the devil's power.
 But you're powerless against  things you can't evade.
 You're no match for someone  at a higher stage, like myself.
 Poison Creation Magic: Basilisk's Breath.
 In the end, you're absolutely worthless.  You won't even serve as food for him.
 Demon-Destroyer!
 What?
 He erased... the poison?
 How could scum like you have such a power?
 You may have the devil's power,
 but it looks like you've  only got a tiny piece of it.
 Sacrificing the citizens for the  prosperity of your kingdom, my ass!
 If you want to fight so badly,
 I'll crush all of you!
 He definitely made a mess again... That Stupidsta.
 What?
 How did he...
 Impossible!
 I beat the strongest guy,  as well as everyone else!
 You don't have to worry anymore!
 Hey, it's Noelle and the others!  Her water armor's always super cool!
 And now she can use the traveling  water bubble at the same time!
 Man, she's really grown—
 Huh?
 Hmph! Just so you know,
 controlling a transport spell while going  through a strong magic region is super hard!
 Yes, we know, Noelle.
 We made it safely, so you did wonderfully.
 Excellent work.
 Hey, who do you think  you're talking to, Mimosa?
 I'm royalty.
 I am, too...
 Hey, Stupidsta. What's the big idea of leaving me behind like that?
 He's just being his usual self.
 Take me with you, for crying out loud.
 I almost died from the excitement of  being stuck with Noelle and Mimosa.
 Wait, that's nonsense! I wasn't excited at all!
 I only get excited over Miss Finnes now—
 Are you all right, miss?!  Who could have done something so awful?!
 Allow me to gently take care of—
 No, I can't! Not with anyone  other than Miss Finnes!
 Sis, that guy is really weird.
 You're so awesome, Finral!  You've grown so much!
 Thanks, Asta.
 There's nothing awesome  about this. Are you stupid?
 I still have a hard time believing  Finral has a fiancée.
 Are you sure you didn't just imagine her?
 Noelle, she's totally real!
 What's going on?
 Plant Recovery Magic:  Princess-Healing Flower Paradise.
 I cannot recover your mana,  but I can recover your stamina.
 Mimosa's magic totally powered up, too!
 Way to go!
 Thank you very much, Asta.
 Wow.
 But...
 The place where you live  was taken over, too, right?
 Yes.
 Our town...
 One night, without warning,  that army suddenly showed up.
 Anyone who defied them  was killed on the spot.
 If we go back there, we'll probably  be executed for escaping.
 You don't need to worry about that.
 Huh?
 Luck and Leopold are heading over there.
 Honestly, Stupidsta! Who does he think he is?
 We shall follow Asta's lead!
 It's no fun leaving it all to Asta.
 Come to think of it, I never see  her in formal attire anymore...
 No! I have a separate mission  for you, Leopold and Luck!
 Huh?
 This is the perfect opportunity.
 Let's take over the Spade Kingdom's  outlying base!
 What?!
 Noelle, Mimosa, and Finral,  please go back Asta up.
 U-Um... Do we really want to  split up our forces like that?
 It'll be all right.
 I'm sure all of you will be fine now.
 Man, I'm bored. Why do we have to waste  our time watching over this dumb village?
 Hey! Don't let the captain hear you!
 An intruder!
 Why, you—
 You're mine!
 Is this really...
 all you guys have got?!
 I was told everyone here  was stage two or lower.
 Which means it doesn't matter how many  there are. They're no match for us!
 Flame Magic: Profound Spiral Flames!
 Huh? Did we beat all of them already?
 Yes! There's no more left for you!
 Boo.
 We're all done over here.
 That was so fast!
 Asta! You don't get to have all the fun!
 Leo! Man, you sure did grow up!
 I am Fuegoleon and Mereoleona's little brother.
 Of course I've grown!
 I'm so jealous!
 I've marked this place, so I'm gonna head out.  I'll come back for you guys later.
 Thanks, Finral!
 Looks like everything went well.
 We've received word that they were able  to take over the base successfully.
 I had confidence that  they were up to the task,
 but they far exceeded my expectations.
 Yes. But...
 Yes.
 The real battle has yet to begin.
 Our town...
 Are the soldiers gone?
 We can go home?
 Really?
 What do you intend to do to our town?
 Huh? What do we intend to do to it?
 I mean, the ones who just took it over...
 Your friends are from the  Clover Kingdom, right?
 We can't survive unless we obey the strong.
 Isn't that right?
 What are we going to do?  I mean, it's your town, isn't it?
 We're not gonna do anything to it!
 Huh?
 Finral's gonna take all of you  guys back there with his magic!
 Just hang tight!
 Really?
 They won't take our mana from us?
 We really get to go back home?
 That's great!
 Thank you so much!
 Thanks, mister!
 We just want to defeat the devil  that's in the Spade Kingdom!
 The devil?
 C-Currently, the Spade Kingdom
 is ruled by sinister mages  known as the Dark Triad,
 along with the Dark Disciples, whom they've  bestowed powers upon to help them rule.
 They are all incredibly powerful.
 I heard that the Dark Triad are  as fearsome as devils themselves.
 The Dark Triad...
 It appears as though you've grown quite  accustomed to using the devil's power, Zenon.
 Yes... For the most part.
 We've received reports that Candelo,
 the fortress we sent toward the Heart Kingdom,  and our base on the border have fallen.
 Just leave them be.
 We need to give our soldiers something  to do, or they'll get bored.
 Hey, Big Bro Dante!  Why does Zenon get all the fun?
 You let him go to the Diamond  Kingdom all by himself, too!
 I was more suited for that mission.
 What? But you only used about  40% of your powers back there!
 I can do about that much too, you know.
 Aw... I wanna do something big, too!
 You've grown much yourself, Vanica.
 Right?! So come on!
 Yes, you're right.  It's about time we make our move.
 Yay! I'll finally be able to eat
 that delicious treat I've been saving.
 Why did we wait half a year?
 All so we could prepare for the time to come.
 It'd be no fun if the game ended instantly.
 We're going to wipe  everything from this world.
 All order, everything people have  done, the blessings of nature...
 We're going to make it all meaningless.
 The keys we need to open the  door are within our reach.
 The two arcane-stage mages...
 They cannot escape.
 All life is within the palms of our hands.
 Asta's working hard even in other kingdoms.
 But...
 He wrote, ""I think the big  battle's going to start soon.""
 Oh, dear. It's getting cloudy.
 O-Oh, no!
 Lord Yuno...
 Petit Clover

 Comparing Heights
 Comparing Heights.
 Behold, Asta! See how much I've grown!
 Well, I mean, I've grown, too,  maybe, I think, somewhat!
 If you look closer, I think you'll  see we're about the same height!
 Don't be foolish! Then let  us compare our heights!
 See? I told you!
 Asta's in trouble!
 I must help him!
 See? We are about the same!
 But that's impossible!
 Good for you, Asta.
 While I'm at it, I'll just let you win.
 How do you like that, Leo!  I'm taller than you?!
 Uh, even I would notice this.
 Leo! Who said you could grow without me?!
 Well, it has been six months.
 I've also grown these six...  Hey! Just where are you looking?!

 a devil.
 What Asta, who was born without magic,
 gained from the five-leaf grimoire was
 the power of anti-magic,  which nullifies any magic.
 Meanwhile, the Dark Triad  of the Spade Kingdom
 also possessed the powers of  the devils from the underworld,
 and began invading the other kingdoms.
 Asta continued to fight  while believing in himself,
 along with his friends...  to protect this world!
 At last, the battle against the devil  and the Spade Kingdom began.
 Asta and the others spent six months  training in the Heart Kingdom.
 They then rescued some citizens  of the Spade Kingdom
 and succeeded in taking  over one of their bases.
 Meanwhile, back in Hage Village, where Asta and Yuno grew up,
 the wheels of fate were beginning to turn.
 O-Oh, no!
 Lord Yuno...
 Quiet Lakes and Forest Shadows
 Where are Nash and the others?
 I sent them off to school.
 I'm sure this would make  some of the kids nervous.
 Yes.
 How is he doing?
 He's still asleep.
 I used a recovery spell,  but his wounds are deep.
 Maybe he ran into some bandits in the forest.
 Depending on the situation, we may  have to contact the Magic Knights.
 Yes.
 Who could he be?
 Good work, everyone.
 Thanks to you, we were able to make  one of the Spade Kingdom's bases,
 the town of Tolon, our own.
 I hear that all the citizens of the  Spade Kingdom who were captured
 in the mobile fortress are recovering.
 Thank you very much.
 Are you sure you wanted us to come back?
 You could've just had your  forces proceed from there.
 Stage two guys weren't enough.  I wanna fight someone stronger.
 We're dealing with devils here.  We can't just go barging into the unknown.
 We have to rest and recover.
 Will the town be all right  in terms of its defense?
 You can leave that to us.
 I asked Noelle to take one of  my clones to the town of Tolon.
 Through that clone, I've set up the same  barrier there that the Heart Kingdom has.
 Because I have the devil's curse within me,
 I can sense the devil's magic immediately.
 Let's continue to gain more territory and  corner the devil in the Spade Kingdom.
 Yeah!
 Honestly... You sure are making that  sound much easier than it's going to be.
 That's all for today.  Please keep up the good work.
 But with Loropechika's powers,  we might just be able to do it.
 This queen is insane.
 I still haven't had enough yet.
 Hey, Gaja. Play with me again today.
 The Spirit Guardian of Fire who trained me,  Floga, is extremely powerful,
 but I'd love to know how  powerful you are, too.
 I'd also love to spar with you.
 Ooh! Me, too!
 All of you just returned from battle,  so please get some rest.
 No, I'm totally fine!  You don't need to worry about me!
 Then let's have a bloodbath together!
 I'm getting fired up!
 Ooh, this sounds like fun.  I'd like to join in, too.
 You know you can't do that,  Loropechika! What are you saying?!
 I'm fi—
 Loropechika!
 Everyone seems well.
 Honestly, they're all so stupid.
 I got all dirty in the strong magic region,  so I'm going to take a bath.
 I shall join you, Noelle.
 You're going too, Loropechika.
 You're a queen, so you need to enjoy  an elegant bath, not a bloodbath.
 All right...
 Oh, I just happen to know  the best place for a bath.
 The cuties from the Clover Kingdom are
 going to take a bath with the beautiful  queen of the Heart Kingdom...
 No, don't, Finral!
 Don't you dare get excited over any  woman other than Miss Finnes!
 Resist!
 Finral, make up any weird  fantasies and I'll kill you.
 Noelle! I'm doing everything  I can to resist right now!
 Th-There's trouble!
 In the Polnfrume Forest...
 A wild Charmy has appeared!
 If we don't do something,  she'll eat up all the fruits in the forest!
 Again?
 Wait, again?
 Well, you see, it appears Miz Charmy really took
 a liking to the food in the Heart Kingdom.
 And she's been causing trouble everywhere.
 In one of the forests, she took  over a group of monkeys
 La...
 and had them bring her bananas.
 And in another forest, she fought  a bear over some super rare apples.
 La...
 Well, the fruits in the Heart  Kingdom are indeed delicious.
 It must be the pure water here.
 Good grief. We should go fetch her  before she causes any more trouble.
 I'll go! I'm sure you're pretty tired  from moving all those people around,
 so you should get some rest, Finral.
 I think you moved around  way more than I did, Asta.
 But I don't use any magic, so I'm fine!
 I'm talking about your stamina, actually...
 Well, good luck.
 We're counting on you.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Demon-Slayer!
 I'm going to control my anti-magic...
 and fly!
 The kid without magic who  couldn't fly on a broom...
 He's turned into an impressive guy.
 How lovely.
 This is a secret spring that's been  passed down through the generations
 of the royal family of the Heart Kingdom.
 Oh, my. I'm so honored that  you've brought us here.
 I sense some very pure mana.
 Elmora Lake has some of the finest  water in all of the Heart Kingdom.
 If you bathe in these waters,  your skin will be nice and smooth.
 Let's go in.
 Indeed.
 Finally, I feel so much better.
 It's so nice and cold.
 Oops! I forgot to take these off.
 Oh, Loropechika...
 By the way, I've been meaning  to ask you girls this for a while...
 Which one of you is dating Asta?
 What?!
 Ooh, are we talking about relationships?  I'd love to know myself!
 W-We're not dating him!
 A-Asta is a very lovely gentleman  who's very kind and reliable,
 but now is not the time for that.
 Then how about when the battle  with the Spade Kingdom ends?
 What?
 Well, you obviously don't seem to mind.
 Oh, but the one who always  seems to be with him is Nero.
 Is that because you two are dating?!
 His head is nice to perch on.
 Is that all it is?
 Yes.
 So you're only interested  in the top of his head.
 I-I see.
 Nero's saying that now,
 but what if they become closer as  they spend more time together?
 So what about you, Noelle?
 I'd never date S-S-S-Stupidsta!
 Oh, I see.
 I see.
 Wh-What about you, Loropechika?
 Y-Yes. Are you seeing Gaja?
 Huh? Me and Gaja? Yeah, no.
 Really? But you're always together.
 You'd make a lovely couple.
 That'll never happen.  I'm sure Gaja feels the same.
 Poor Gaja. I'd never tell him that, though.
 This is fun!
 No wonder you're the leader  of the Spirit Guardians.
 Your strength knows no bounds.
 Because you both managed to  grow so surprisingly quickly,
 this is excellent training for me, too.
 I must also become stronger, just like them.
 I will protect the Heart Kingdom,  even if it costs my life.
 I'm so happy that everyone from  the Clover Kingdom is so nice.
 I didn't know what I would do if you  all turned out to be scary people.
 That's our line.
 I know it was to check our magic stages,  but you just suddenly attacked us.
 Sorry about that.
 We're very grateful that the  Queen of the Heart Kingdom
 is someone as lovely as you, Loropechika.
 Mimosa...
 And everyone in the Heart Kingdom  has been so kind to us.
 Yes.
 Well, we're all going to  face the devil together.
 I'm glad you're someone we can trust.
 Th-Though it's a shame you're so clumsy.
 Hey.
 Thank you very much.
 Despite appearances, I am trying  my best to be a proper queen
 in front of the citizens  of the Heart Kingdom.
 Though I'm not good at it.
 So I'm happy to have some friends  I can be so honest with.
 I'm so happy we became friends.
 You're so cute, Loropechika.
 Oh, come on. Now you're making me blush.
 We feel the same as you, Loropechika.
 It's so great flying through the sky!
 The passing breeze!
 The sweet, fruity scent!
 Hm? Sweet scent?
 She must be there!
 Miz Charmy!
 Hey, Asta.
 Want some noms?
 Holy crap, she gained weight!
 Just how much did you eat?!
 It's all because the fruit in the  Heart Kingdom is so nummy.
 You shouldn't eat any more, Miz Charmy!
 La? You tryin' to stop me, Asta?
 Well, yeah! You've obviously  eaten too much—
 Listen up, Asta.
 We don't eat to live.
 We live to eat!
 What?!
 So...
 People who get in the way of good eatin'  will get run over by sheep and die.
 Uh, what?
 Miz Charmy?!
 What's going on?
 Hey, that's...
 That's Charmy's sheep!
 Charmy's out of control!
 Charmy...
 Golden Dawn Headquarters
 Vice Captain, do you have a moment?
 I'm about to go on a mission.
 Is this urgent?
 Well... we've received a message  from a church in Hage Village,
 out in the boonies.
 Tell me at once.
 That's Charmy's sheep!
 Charmy's gone wild!
 Cotton! It's using cotton to gather food!
 It's headed this way!
 She's attacking with all  the hungry forest animals!
 At this rate, all of the food in the  forest is going to be gobbled up!
 I...
 I may have created a monster.
 The Mana Method basically makes recipes...  and the dishes they create are magic!
 That means I must eat in order to learn the Mana Method, la!
 I didn't really understand her logic,  but I decided to support her.
 Charmy is a genius Magic Knight.
 The best thing I could do for her would  be to make her talent shine even more.
 But she fell in love with all  the food in the Heart Kingdom,
 and she ended up at the top  of the forest's food chain.
 It's my duty to stop her!
 Plant Magic: Evergreen Vida Valtoria.
 I can't stop it! They're just  going through. In that case...
 Wow!
 Way to go, Sir Potrof!
 W-We're finished!
 Oh, dear.
 I thought I was going to suffocate!
 Are you all right, Asta?
 Potrof! Thank you!
 At this rate, everyone's dinners  are going to be stolen, too!
 Will you help me out, Asta?
 Right back at you!
 Fruits are truly the best.
 They're delicious, healthy, and mostly water, so you never gain weight.
 So you still haven't given up, Master.
 But once the flames of my hunger have  been lit, not even you can stop them!
 Then I'll just have to  stop you once and for all!
 La?
 All right!
 What?!
 That's not fair!
 Then I'll just have to cut it somewhere that can't be avoided!
 'Scuse me for a bit!
 What the heck?! I keep cutting,  but there's no end!
 Oh, crap!
 Even Asta doesn't stand a chance...
 Does this mean all we can do is  watch as she devours everything?
 Leave this to me, Potrof!
 Rill!
 Charmy... we trained together.
 As your friend, I cannot allow  your rampage to continue!
 Picture Magic: Invasion of Heat-Infused Ice!
 You saved me, Rill!
 I see! We can attack it if it's frozen!
 Let's go, Asta!
 Yeah!
 La!
 They defeated the Charmy!
 Thank you!
 Goodness, my students caused a mess...  Though I am happy with how much they've grown.
 La...
 Charmy, overeating is bad for you.
 Sorry. It's just that the Heart Kingdom's  fruits are so yummy
 that I couldn't help myself.
 You totally saved me back there, Rill.
 You got even more insane than before!
 Well, training in the Heart Kingdom  has been super fun.
 And whenever I think of a certain someone,
 my inspiration and need  to create just won't stop.
 A certain someone?
 The goddess who saved me when  I was possessed by the elf.
 She's my soulmate!
 I want to become a powerful man worthy  of her... and a powerful captain.
 That goddess...
 is totally Miz Charmy, Rill!
 Huh?
 What are you talking about, Asta?  They're totally different. She wasn't this fat.
 Yeah, I know that, but...
 And what are you talking about, Rill?  I'm not that fat.
 I'm pleasantly plump.  Obviously, the most popular body type.
 You're still eating! Can't you  do anything besides eat?!
 How rude, Asta! Of course I think of  something besides eating sometimes.
 Something besides eating...
 I wonder how Yuno is doing.
 We're almost to Hage Village.
 This place is always so dull.
 We're finally alone, but it  doesn't feel like a date at all.
 I don't know what they need to tell you,
 but we're finally going on a date afterward.
 Yuno, are you listening?
 Hey, Yuno!
 Bell, shut up.
 Yuno!
 Sister.
 Welcome home. Sorry, I know you must be busy.
 Yeah! Yuno's super busy!
 I'm fine. Did something happen?
 Well... why don't you come in first?
 You're the spitting image of Lord Ciel.
 And that necklace... There's no doubt about it!
 Who the heck is this old guy?
 Apparently, he's from the Spade Kingdom.
 Guess we need to kick his butt, then!
 I am not your enemy!
 The Spade Kingdom was originally  a peaceful kingdom.
 Despite how bitterly cold it got,
 the people lived happily under the  rule of the House of Grinberryall...
 until the Dark Triad appeared,  exiled the Grinberryalls,
 and ruled over the people with fear.
 Lord Yuno...
 You are our hope. You belong  to the House of Grinberryall.
 Meaning...
 You are the Prince of the Spade Kingdom!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 The Ultimate Canvas
 The Ultimate Canvas.
 I just can't draw her enough!
 Ah, my goddess!
 Munchy, munchy, munchy,  munchy, munchy, munchy...
 Rill, you don't want to draw  this version of Miz Charmy?
 I'm too busy trying to get every detail  of the goddess's beauty perfect right now.
 This canvas is so soft and smooth.  It's as though I'm painting on a cloud!
 This may just become my ultimate masterpiece!
 R-Rill, that's—
 And done! My ideal goddess has descended!
 Wait a minute...
 Just how wrapped up were you in your work?!
 Ack, please don't eat any more, Charmy!  You're going to stretch my goddess out!
 La? Rill, those who get in  the way of others' meals...
 Please! No more, Miz Charmy!
 You can't be serious.
 You can't be serious about me being  the Prince of the Spade Kingdom.
 But I am serious.
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 160:  ""The Messenger from the Spade Kingdom.""

160,"And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...
 a devil.
 What Asta, who was born without magic,
 gained from the five-leaf grimoire was
 the power of anti-magic,  which nullifies any magic.
 Meanwhile, the Dark Triad  of the Spade Kingdom
 also possessed the powers of  the devils from the underworld,
 and began invading the other kingdoms.
 Asta continued to fight  while believing in himself,
 along with his friends...  to protect this world!
 Asta and the others took over one of the  Spade Kingdom's bases, the town of Tolon,
 and returned to the Heart Kingdom.
 They enjoyed a moment's rest,
 but then...
 Charmy's power and appetite  had grown from training,
 and along with all the hungry animals,
 she was trying to eat  all the food in the forest.
 Picture Magic: Invasion of Heat-Infused Ice!
 Thus things calmed down for the moment.
 Around the same time,
 Yuno received a message and  returned to his home village of Hage.
 He then received shocking news  from the man he met there.
 You belong to the House of Grinberryall.
 Meaning...
 You are the Prince of the Spade Kingdom!
 The Messenger from the Spade Kingdom
 Where's Vice Captain Yuno?
 Apparently he received  word from his hometown,
 so he quickly wrapped up a  mission and headed over there.
 That quick? As expected.
 His hometown? You mean Hage Village, out in the boonies?
 Yes.
 Considering how much mana he has,
 it's hard to believe he's actually  from the Forsaken Realm.
 It doesn't matter where he was born.  Yuno is obviously a very skilled Magic Knight.
 Oh? What's this?
 What?
 You have a lot of rivals.
 Huh?
 Yuno has fan clubs all throughout  the kingdom right now.
 Yuno!
 It's not like that!
 No, really. He's amazing.
 A year and a half after he joined  our squad, he's already vice captain.
 He might just become the Wizard King.
 Yuno...
 ...is the Prince of the Spade Kingdom?!
 I always knew he was amazing,  but he's actually a prince?!
 This is unbelievable!
 I knew it! I totally  thought that was the case!
 He's royalty! Royalty!
 Quiet down, both of you.
 You're overflowing with  dignity and class. Of course!
 What is this creature?
 I'm one of the Four Great Spirits,  the Wind Spirit Slyph!
 I'm the one who's closest to Yuno!
 You have the Wind Spirit!  Amazing, Prince Yuno!
 Then what about Asta?
 Asta?
 The child that was abandoned in  front of this church alongside Yuno!
 I-I have no idea.
 I just know that Prince Yuno is  the Prince of the Spade Kingdom.
 Where are you even coming up with this?
 Me? The Prince of the Spade Kingdom?
 Yes!
 Even if I was, why would the  Prince of the Spade Kingdom
 be abandoned in the Clover Kingdom?
 Th-That's because...
 Let me change the question.  Why did you come here?
 I'm sorry. I should've said this  earlier. My name is Ralph.
 I came here you tell you the truth.
 So with my brethren's  thoughts and mana within me,
 I traveled through the strong  magic region to get here.
 Just as my father did.
 Prince Yuno...
 Flame Magic: Trace Mirage.
 Please take a look at your past.
 This is...
 Apparently, on that day, a ray of light  managed to break through the thick clouds
 in the sky over the Spade Kingdom.
 It was as though it was a sign foretelling  a bright future for the kingdom.
 Your Majesty...
 Perhaps you should calm down.
 R-Right...
 He's born!
 He's a healthy baby boy.
 Thank you so much for being born.
 My beautiful child...
 Ciel...
 Thank you. You worked so hard.
 My love...
 I obtained this magic stone   long ago when I made it
 safely back through  the strong magic region.
 I will give it to Yuno for protection.
 That name...
 ""If it's a boy, we'll name him Yuno.""
 That's the name you chose, isn't it?
 Yes!
 He's born! The prince is born!
 An heir has been born!
 He's born! The prince has been born!
 They said that the festivities continued  long into the night that day.
 Your birth was truly a ray of hope that  shone through the long, harsh winter
 that had closed off our kingdom.
 Everyone always smiled  around you, Prince Yuno.
 How do I get him to stop crying?
 Guess you're not so tough now, Captain of  the Mage Defense Force's 1st Division.
 Did you already forget what  you did for your own son?
 I let my wife handle all that.
 Hey, he stopped crying!
 He's the son of King Loyce and Queen Ciel.
 I'm sure he'll be an amazing mage.
 Yes. He's going to be a way  more powerful mage than you.
 Like you can talk!
 Prince Yuno truly is adorable.
 There, there...
 Our duty is to make sure these  days of peace are protected.
 Ralph, you'll eventually join  the Mage Defense Force.
 Make sure you do your best to protect Yuno.
 Yes, Father!
 He finally stopped crying.
 Yes.
 Will he be all right?
 What?
 He's such a crybaby... but eventually,  he'll need to take my place on the throne.
 What?
 Yuno is still a baby. I think it's  too soon to worry about that.
 You think so?
 Right, my little crybaby?
 No one could've known that
 those days filled with happiness  would come to an abrupt end.
 The Zogratis siblings have returned!
 Well done on your subjugation mission.
 Make sure you get plenty of rest.
 And continue to work hard to  maintain the peace of this kingdom.
 As you wish... For the peace of this kingdom.
 Always keep an eye on those three.
 What do you mean, Father?
 I have a bad feeling about them.
 I see.
 I heard those three killed all the rebels.
 Yes.
 Did you order them to do so?
 Don't be ridiculous!
 Oh, there, there.
 I cannot bring myself to like those three.
 I wonder why Father said that.
 Regardless, I swear fealty to this kingdom.
 Ralph, why don't you take a break?
 Yeah, sure. Thanks.
 If I had listened to my father's words
 and kept my eye on those three, the Dark Triad,
 we may have been able to avoid that tragedy.
 Treason!
 The Zogratis siblings  have attacked the castle!
 This is the best!
 Halt!
 Traitors!
 Ooh, here we go!
 I guess it's time to make that  mountain of corpses even higher!
 Unbelievable...
 No! The Mage Defense Force's troops are  being taken out one after another.
 They're too powerful... We can't stop them!
 Does this mean the rumor that the devil's  power has been bestowed upon them is true?
 Why would you do this?
 Father!
 Where are the king and queen?
 Wait...
 They have left...
 the future with me.
 Isn't it boring that they're all so weak?
 I'll buy us some time! Please hurry!
 Don't you think so, Zenon?
 Yeah.
 Ralph, I swear to protect  Prince Yuno with my life.
 Make sure you survive.
 I promise I will!
 That was the last time I saw my father.
 Is Prince Yuno safe?
 Yes.
 I don't think they'd actually  try to kill Prince Yuno, but...
 There's no guarantee of that.
 Wait. They have no right to the throne.
 They would need Prince Yuno.
 Do you think that those  three are after the throne?
 Are they not?
 I'm not sure. But I feel something more  ominous that I can't put my finger on.
 We cannot let them have Prince Yuno.
 They know everything about  this kingdom, just like we do.
 We must leave here.
 So we will move according to plan!
 They split into three groups!
 It'll be all right, Prince Yuno.
 Just hold on a bit longer.
 I will risk my life to protect you,
 and I'm sure that amulet  will protect you, too.
 Wait, did he enter...
 ...the strong magic region?
 What shall we do?
 It doesn't matter.
 But things may be difficult  if the prince is left alive.
 If you think that, then kill him.
 Y-Yes, sir.
 I will protect you, no matter what...
 Prince Yuno!
 That's a church.
 That place should be...
 This is my final spell for you, Prince Yuno.
 Please become strong.
 I see they're already here.
 Since I'm this far from the church,  Prince Yuno should be safe.
 Prince Yuno... Please stay safe.
 I refuse to die at your hands!
 Ralph... I'm leaving the future to you.
 Yuno...
 Considering how much mana you have,  I'm sure you realize that
 everything I've shown  you actually happened.
 There are no lies here.
 That's exactly what a liar would say!
 Don't believe him, Yuno!
 My family served the  royal family for generations.
 It's not just me.
 There are many citizens being  oppressed by the Dark Triad
 who are praying that you're safe.
 What's the matter?
 There's trouble, Vice Captain!
 The Golden Dawn's headquarters...
 is under attack!
 What?!
 So you don't mind us going wild...
 Lord Zenon?
 You can kill everyone other than  the arcane stage mage we're after.
 Yuno?
 Please wait, Prince Yuno!
 If they were able to get into  the Clover Kingdom that easily,
 they must be the Dark Triad,  or almost as powerful!
 You mustn't fight them carelessly!
 I am the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn.
 Prince Yuno!
 I'll go, too!
 You must stay in bed.
 Yuno...
 Yuno, your face is really scary right now.
 I bet you're thinking about  how to kick those bad guys' butts!
 I knew it! I'm so smart!
 You are our hope. You belong  to the House of Grinberryall.
 Meaning...
 You are the Prince of the Spade Kingdom!
 Even so, I'm Yuno of the Clover Kingdom.
 Faster... I need to move faster!
 The look of them...
 They're mages from the Spade Kingdom!
 I don't know how they got here, but the  fact that they got into our headquarters...
 Make them regret ever coming here!
 Everyone, concentrate your  attack spells on them!
 Wha—
 Impossible...
 They're unharmed?
 Where did the other one go?
 Come on, now.
 Is this all you've got? I heard you guys  were the best squad in the Clover Kingdom.
 Well, I guess I can't blame you.
 We are the elite among those deemed
 suitable to be bestowed  powers by the Dark Triad.
 We, the Dark Disciples, are all stage zero.
 Stage zero?
 He disappeared?
 Hey, stone magic, just like me!
 But man, you're weak!
 Shire—
 The devil's powers elevate your  magic to another dimension!
 Our army's captains can handle about 5%.
 But I can unleash about 40%!
 And Lord Zenon, who's possessed by a devil...
 can unleash 80%!
 I've been looking for you.
 So you're the arcane stage Magic Knight,
 the Captain of the Golden Dawn,  William Vangeance.
 This mana...
 Halt!
 Get away from Lord Vangeance!
 Alecdora, don't! Stay back!
 I may have been a vessel for the elves,
 but it is my will to fight for you!
 Alecdora...
 As a Magic Knight of the Golden Dawn...
 I will strike down this invader!
 This magic...
 World Tree Magic: Magic Warding Ash!
 Lord Vangeance...
 No matter who you are...
 I will not allow you to hurt  any of my squad members!
 So that's world tree magic.
 To benefit the Spade Kingdom,  I'll be taking you.
 Bone Magic: Eternal Fangs.
 Everyone!
 Oh?
 What do you think you're looking at, little fly who was late to the party?
 What do you think you're doing...
 to my comrades?!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Yuno's Fan Clubs
 Yuno's Fan Clubs.
 It doesn't matter where he was born.  Yuno is obviously a very skilled Magic Knight.
 Oh? What's this?
 What?
 You have a lot of rivals.
 Huh?
 Yuno has fan clubs all throughout  the kingdom right now.
 I'm aware of that.
 I mean, I'm in charge of the  Golden Dawn's Yuno fan club.
 There's one in the Golden Dawn, too?!
 Of course there is!
 You said so yourself. Yuno has fan  clubs all throughout the kingdom.
 Right...
 Of course, I have buttons,  clear files, acrylic stands,
 and every other type of Yuno merchandise.
 And of course, I follow  him on social media, too.
 Hang on a second!  Yuno has social media accounts?!
 You won't get away with this.
 What do you think you're doing to my comrades?

 Ralph showed Yuno his history.
 At that moment, he received word that the  Golden Dawn headquarters was under attack.
 Even so, I'm Yuno of the Clover Kingdom.
 The ones who attacked were  mages from the Spade Kingdom,
 Gaderois and Foyal...
 We are the elite among those deemed
 suitable to be bestowed  powers by the Dark Triad.

 So that's world tree magic.
 To benefit the Spade Kingdom,  I'll be taking you.
 Bone Magic: Eternal Fangs.
 When he returned to the Golden Dawn's  headquarters, he saw...
 Everyone!
 ...an unbelievable tragedy.
 What do you think you're doing...
 to my comrades?!
 Zenon's Power
 There were many members of the  Golden Dawn who looked down on you
 for being a peasant.
 They despised you and were  jealous of your powers.
 That includes myself, too.
 Why in the world would you have  to defend the likes of them?
 Because they're my comrades.
 I don't need a reason to know that  my comrades are important to me.
 I'm sorry.
 Then let's all go get something  to eat after we're done reporting.
 Yuno, wait!
 Yuno...
 We're also inviting you... rather,  this invitation was specifically for you, Yuno.
 Huh? No, I...
 Hamon knows a number of places around  the royal capital that serve delicious food.
 Let's just invite the whole  gang and have a blast!
 Hey!
 Becoming the vice captain after just  eighteen months on the squad?
 Who the hell do you think you are?
 Yeah, seriously.
 Thanks.
 You little brat.
 Take that, and that! Well?  You give up? You give up?
 Yuno's actually smiling lately.
 Yup.
 A smile suits you much better.
 Hey! I'm the only one allowed to stare  at Yuno's happy yet bashful face!
 Take that, and that.
 Hey, what are you doing?
 Now, now, calm down. No fighting.
 Why, you!
 I'm sure we killed about half of them.
 And the other half's following right behind.
 They died fighting a really strong enemy,  so they should be honored!
 Wind Spirit Magic: Spirit Storm!
 Oh? So you've been chosen  by the Wind Spirit, eh?
 That's great!
 My stone magic that's been  enhanced by the devil's powers
 is way harder than iron or steel!
 No wind is even gonna scratch it!
 Mana Zone: Spirit's Hushed Dance.
 This guy is attacking me while  protecting those who are about to die.
 The arcane stage captain should  be fighting Lord Zenon right now.
 Who knew that anyone other than  captains could be a zero stage?
 Things are definitely getting interesting!
 I'm Gaderois! Who're you?
 I have no reason to tell someone like you...
 my name!
 Aw, guess you don't like me much.
 Don't be like that. Let's be friends...
 and kill each other!
 Why did you attack this place?
 Huh? I don't know the details.
 But the Dark Triad is in need  of some arcane stage mage.
 I don't care as long as I get  to go wild with my magic!
 Arcane stage?!
 The Dark Triad is the best.
 They killed our last king,  a peace-loving fool,
 and gave those of us who wanted  to fight even more powers.
 The last king was an idiot.
 The strong are always right!
 The strong are free to do whatever they want!
 When you hurt or kill people...
 What kind of emotions do you feel?
 Huh?! I feel insanely excited and  awesomely refreshed, of course!
 That's why I can't give this up!
 That's why you're so strong, too, isn't it?!
 There's no way...
 I'm anything like you, scum!
 Wind Spirit Creation Magic:
 Spirit of Zephyr!
 Not bad!
 But your magic still isn't  enough to defeat me!
 It's all clear to me now.
 Things get messed up in this world  because people like you exist.
 No matter how much time passes,  the curse persists.
 The hell are you rambling abou—
 He's instantly undoing my stone magic?
 Whether I'm a mage from the Clover Kingdom
 or the Prince of the Spade  Kingdom... It doesn't matter.
 I'll cut right through you!
 The range on this spell is insane.
 I have no idea where the enemy is.
 You know...
 Your magic is pretty hard.
 Steel Magic: Blazing Spiral Lance!
 Too bad.
 Your magic is just hard. It can't hit me.
 Let's go a little stronger  this time, shall we?
 I'm a zero stage. I'm a genius  chosen by the Dark Triad.
 Even if there was a whole army of  you scrubs, you couldn't beat me!
 How in the world are they so much stronger?
 He's not even the leader, and his magic  is equal to a Magic Knights Squad Captain.
 What's going on with the  mages from the Spade Kingdom?
 Everyone's mana is...
 I need to do something,
 or we're going to be wiped out!
 But I can't even tell where the enemy is.
 Useless North isn't responding to his magic,
 and this is as big as Another Atlas can get.
 Some of the elves' magic  still remains within us.
 I'm sure some of you would rather disavow it,  since it was used to attack the kingdom.
 But now, we can take that tremendous power
 and use it as an amazing force  to protect the Clover Kingdom.
 After about six months of training,  though I'm still not as powerful as an elf,
 I made this power mine.
 But the enemy's magic is just too powerful!
 Your magic's been destroyed,  as well as your body.
 Just give up.
 You seem smart enough to understand.
 You have no chance.
 My will...
 has not been broken!
 Then just die already, you piece of trash.
 Klaus!
 Yuno!
 He blew away my mist.
 He's a natural enemy.
 But...
 Mist Creation Magic: Sealing Spectral Hands.
 The damage from that last fight...
 You seem a bit tired.
 I knew it. No matter how many of you  there are, you're all just going to die.
 I know where you are now, thanks to Yuno!
 I'll move myself and Another Atlas,
 and rip away your illusionary armor!
 You utter trash...
 How... can he still move with  his body in that state?
 Whenever I have to face someone  with such natural gifts, I think...
 Despite how much I may train, I still  might not be able to surpass them.
 But now, as a Magic Knight...
 I'm going to continue to break through!
 Why can I still move?
 Because I train regularly.
 Letoile!
 Yuno! Er, I mean, Vice Captain Yuno.
 Thank you for your help.
 Team Leader Klaus...
 You hardly need to address me that way now.
 You're a true vice captain now.
 You can stop calling me  ""vice captain."" It's creepy.
 I'm going to be honest. Who cares?
 Well, I care!
 Yuno's the vice captain!  That's basically almost captain!
 So who pushed Yuno to the top?
 It's all thanks to me, of course. Who else?  I'm the best partner there is.
 Right, Yuno?
 Vice captain and captain  are completely different.
 Oh, you're just so modest.
 Owie.
 This mana...
 Captain Vangeance...
 Impossible...
 Who in the world is he?!
 Oh, some of you are still alive.
 You're...
 So Gaderois and Foyal were defeated.
 They were only at 40%.
 I guess there was no point in bringing  them when they couldn't surpass 50%.
 Yuno!
 Quickly! Use Spirit Dive!
 He's bad news.
 There's no time to even dodge!
 He's just...
 He's too powerful!
 Oh?
 Klaus...
 You bastard!
 I can't even cut through  him with Spirit of Zephyr?!
 No, he's...
 regenerating at incredible speed!
 So you're stage zero. Then let me show you...
 just a bit of my devil powers.
 55%.
 It's not that you're weak.
 It's just that I'm far superior.
 This is all...
 for the glory of the Spade Kingdom.
 I-It can't be!
 Prince Yuno!
 Yuno... No! I don't want to leave you!
 Prince Yuno...
 Prince Yuno...
 No...
 You're...
 You're...
 But you're supposed to...
 What?
 This is...
 Yuno's squad...
 His squad captain's magic.
 Y-Yuno!
 Thank goodness!
 Bell...
 Yuno!
 I'm... alive?
 Lord Vangeance's world tree magic...
 He was already quite injured himself.
 But he cast a spell this vast for us?
 Where's Captain Vangeance?
 Was he taken by that man?
 Lord Vangeance...
 What about the others?
 Shiren...
 Oh, Shiren...
 No...
 Hamon...
 He was able to save those on the verge of death...
 But even Captain Vangeance's magic  couldn't save those who were already dead.
 Half of our squad... is dead.
 If only...
 If only I had been stronger...
 This is but the prologue.
 Once our goal is realized,  you will be overwhelmed with despair.

162,"And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...
 a devil.
 What Asta, who was born without magic,
 gained from the five-leaf grimoire was
 the power of anti-magic,  which nullifies any magic.
 Meanwhile, the Dark Triad  of the Spade Kingdom
 also possessed the powers of  the devils from the underworld,
 and began invading the other kingdoms.
 Asta continued to fight  while believing in himself,
 along with his friends...  to protect this world!
 Zenon, one of the members of the  Dark Triad from the Spade Kingdom,
 attacked the Golden Dawn's headquarters  along with some of the Dark Disciples.
 What do you think you're doing...
 to my comrades?!
 Yuno let his rage explode after  seeing his comrades injured,
 and he defeated the Dark Disciples.
 55%.
 It's not that you're weak.
 It's just that I'm far superior.
 It looked as though Yuno had died,
 but thanks to the spell Vangeance  left behind, the Budding of Yggdrasil,
 he came back to life.
 The Great War Breaks Out
 Humans are evil creatures.
 Rage,
 fear,
 hatred,
 revenge,
 and destruction...
 The true nature of humans is evil.
 And we have grown bored of this world.
 Now, then...
 I guess I should get going, as well.
 I can't wait to see what  kind of human he is...
 Arcane stage... Yami Sukehiro.
 This is awesome!
 Aw, I wonder how Loropechika  and her friends are doing.
 I hope they're super energetic!
 They'd be even more fun to destroy then.
 So yummy...
 The Heart Kingdom's food is so yummy.
 So cute... Charmy's so cute.
 Oh, dear. It looks like one troublemaker  took a liking to another.
 Hey, Loropechika!
 No more spoiling Charmy.
 She's about to burst.
 Don't you worry.
 Charmy's cute no matter what shape she's in.
 I will always be a glutton no matter  what shape I'm in, and nothing more.
 I'm not exactly sure why she  came to the Heart Kingdom.
 Honestly...
 Our battle with the Spade Kingdom's  going to happen any day now.
 I'm ready to go anytime.
 As am I!
 We have conquered all of the towns  along the Spade Kingdom's border,
 so we now have a foothold.
 But we must keep in step.
 That's also why Rill and Charlotte
 have returned to the Clover  Kingdom for a captains' meeting.
 But it's also difficult trying  to hold in these raging emotions.
 Wanna fight me, then? I haven't  gotten to fight you for real yet.
 Indeed, you're right!
 While we're at it, let us include  Asta and have a three-way battle!
 Asta's not here, though.
 What?!
 Training's calmed down for now, so he wanted  to take some gifts back to our hideout.
 He went back home with Finral for now.
 It's better to relax  before the battle begins.
 Why don't you all have  something to eat, as well?
 This is all mine, by the way.
 The rest of you, please eat something else.
 Apparently every last  morsel here is for Charmy.
 I told you to stop spoiling her!
 Undine!
 Yes.
 What's wrong, Loropechika?
 We're under attack.
 In total...
 There are six in various locations  throughout the kingdom.
 When did they...
 They got through the Mana  Zone barrier with ease.
 We've told all of the Spirit Guardians
 the locations of the enemies  through Undine's clones.
 They've gone to defend immediately.
 But...
 All six have the devil's power,  and they're all stage zero.
 Even the Spirit Guardians may  have trouble against them.
 Depending on how this goes,  I may need to ask for your help.
 Loropechika!
 This extraordinary magic...
 It belongs to the Dark Triad's Vanica,
 the devil-possessed who hosts Megicula.
 Megicula...
 Nice!
 Dark Disciple Robero Ringert
 From the looks of it, we've probably  killed about a hundred of them.
 Lady Vanica, we should—
 Not yet.
 The more filth we kill in this kingdom,  the more serious Loropechika will get.
 That makes things way more fun!
 As you wish, Lady Vanica...
 Please... step on me more!
 Gross.
 The neutral zone between the Clover  Kingdom and the Spade Kingdom.
 The Black Bulls' hideout was placed  here as a front line of defense.
 Hey, guys!
 I've brought gifts!
 Well, aren't you thoughtful  after being gone for so long?
 There are no good drinking  snacks anywhere around here.
 W-W-Welcome home!
 More importantly, I lack Marie essence.
 Yeah, I can't really do anything about that.
 Hey, the captains' meeting  should be done soon.
 Guess I'd better go pick up Yami.
 Must be rough always going back and forth.
 Thanks for everything you do, Finral.
 Yeah, I'm freakin' exhausted.
 It's pretty far, so I'm gonna make a few  stops along the way. It'll take a while.
 Roger!
 See you guys later.
 How do you think Gordon's doing  with his curse magic studies?
 How the hell would I know?
 I just know that I'm never  going near that house again.
 This is hard.
 You can do it, son.
 I believe in you.
 Gordon, I've brought your dinner.
 This is...
 This is the same sandwich you made  me when we went on our first date!
 This takes me back to the good old days.
 You were eighteen. I was seventeen.
 It was destiny.
 Tell me more about how  you met, Mama, Papa.
 Of course.
 I'm just going to concentrate on my studies.
 Is Henry resting?
 Apparently, he's lacking mana.
 A good number of us aren't here  because of training and such.
 And since Charmy's gone right now,
 we have no way of eating  mana recovery food.
 Charmy's totally hooked on the  food in the Heart Kingdom.
 I guess Charmy's just  Charmy wherever she goes.
 By the way, where's Magna?
 Oh, Magna...
 Just when I thought he was  back from the Heart Kingdom,
 he went off somewhere with Zora.
 Maybe they get along since  they both look so mean.
 Every...one...
 Henry?
 The hell?
 Did something happen?
 The hideout is... floating!
 It looks like Yami Sukehiro  isn't home right now.
 I guess I'll play with all of  you while I await his return.
 An attack from the Spade Kingdom?!
 He's the one making the hideout float?
 By himself?
 Rouge!
 Oh?
 Here... we... go!
 Recombination Magic: The Raging Black Bull.
 Well, he looks threatening enough.  Guess I don't need to hold back!
 Large Reflect Refrain!
 Mana Rocket Punch!
 Insolence.
 Gravity Magic: Presence of the Demon King.
 What the hell kind of magic is that?!
 The trees in the area are breaking in half!
 If we didn't have Rouge,  we'd end up like that, too.
 Ah, you're still in your original shapes  despite being hit by my spell.
 Apparently, one of you has magic  that can manipulate natural laws.
 To think there was another besides  Yami Sukehiro at the arcane stage.
 Excellent.
 You're gonna have to deal with me!
 Well, aren't you a lively one?
 Let's see how much you're  able to entertain me.
 Black Slash!
 Gravity Magic: Presence of the Demon King.
 He negated my magic and then attacked.
 Not bad.
 Magic that interferes with natural laws...
 I didn't expect it to be enough  to overturn death.
 You must be that cat's owner.
 You two, get behind Rouge!
 Fight me!
 Asta!
 His magic... Not only is it powerful, but its range is too vast.
 On top of using magic that  interferes with natural laws,
 you are absolutely beautiful.  Stunning, really.
 You are worthy of Dante of the Dark Triad.
 The Dark Triad? From the Spade Kingdom?!
 So he's the one ruling  over the Spade Kingdom?
 You there. Be my woman.
 What?!
 The hell? You can't be serious!
 Oh, I am very serious.
 So you're the evil boss, huh?!
 Well, that was quite the surprise.
 To think there was a devil-possessed  in the Clover Kingdom, too.
 Black Divider!
 Black Meteorite!
 I can't hit him!
 He dodged an anti-magic spell  made to track mana... and so easily.
 What do we do?
 If he's able to dodge,
 we just gotta keep attacking  until he can't dodge anymore!
 How nice of him to show up here for us.
 If we defeat him here, this whole  pain-in-the-ass ordeal will be over.
 Asta!
 Gauche!
 Look... at me!
 Mirror Magic: Mirror Brigade!
 Mirror Meteorites!
 Take this!
 With that much anti-magic going around, and all at super speed,
 he has no way to block or dodge them!
 50%.
 That's impossible!
 He warped space?!
 What just...
 Let us talk for a while.
 Though we have different ranks,  we are both possessed by devils.
 I'm sure we can see eye to eye.
 We're nothing alike!
 All those terrible things you're  doing to your own people...
 I'll never see eye to eye with you!
 I have no idea what you're talking about,
 but if you're speaking ill of me,  I will take it as a compliment.
 Animals have no malice.
 It is the supreme emotion  that only humans have.
 I'm sure you're very  familiar with it yourself.
 Rage, hatred,
 revenge, and destruction...
 The power of malice.
 When you unleash those feelings of malice,
 you are the most human.
 Evil is humanity's true form.
 You're wrong!
 Even I have times when  I'm filled with bad thoughts.
 Sometimes that even makes me more powerful!
 But I have a strong heart that allows  me to control that and use it for good!
 That's what it means to be human!
 It appears that you're a rather  unique devil-possessed.
 As long as I'm here, I won't  let any of my friends die!
 Honestly...
 You are my woman.
 That means you can't use  that power for anyone else,
 you bad little girl.
 60%.
 No... I trained and worked  so hard to increase my mana,
 and it was all expended in an instant.
 This isn't good. I don't have enough mana  to move the Black Bull... any longer...
 I can't... move...
 We're being pinned down from every direction!
 I have to do something...
 Gravity Magic: Evil God's Pressure Craft.
 You leave me no choice.
 I'll awaken your true feelings for you.
 Don't...
 Stop...
 Stop...
 Stop!
 Gauche!
 My beloved... son...
 Now that's what truly makes you...
 human!
 Asta's attack managed to erase that  guy's magic in this whole area.
 Now, then... Let's see how you do.
 Attacks like that will never reach me.
 I wanted to chat a bit, but it appears  you're too busy losing yourself.
 Who might that devil be,
 Lucifero?
 I do not know. If there are any high-ranking  devils in this world right now,
 it would probably be Zagred,  who left the underworld.
 But it doesn't appear to be him.
 A makeshift power like  being able to erase magic
 is probably the work of a low-ranking  nothing with only trifling mana.
 So that means he's no match for us,
 the ones possessed by  the highest-ranking devils...
 The Dark Triad!
 What in the world is this battle?!
 Asta... Are his devil powers going berserk?
 But right now, we have no  choice but to rely on Asta.
 This isn't good. He won't last long.
 Nero, who can seal wounds, isn't here.
 Even if she was, this might be too...
 Gauche...
 Gauche...
 I couldn't...
 I couldn't do anything...
 My transformation magic...  is absolutely useless!
 I'm impressed that you can still  do all this in that state.
 I guess I'll finish you now.
 Goodness. You're still not giving up.
 Anything you do is futile.
 He managed to predict...
 where I'd show up?
 How dare you...
 mark me?
 Please don't die, Gauche!
 After all, you're my...
 Your what?
 I-I'm so embarrassed!
 Next time on Black Clover, Page 163:  ""Dante VS The Captain of the Black Bulls.""

 I'm so embarrassed!

 Yes.
 The Dark Disciples, who had the devils'  powers bestowed upon them,
 attacked the Heart Kingdom.
 Leading this attack was  a member of the Dark Triad,
 Vanica, who was possessed by Megicula.
 Meanwhile, in the neutral zone between  the Clover Kingdom and Spade Kingdom,
 where the Black Bulls had  relocated their base,
 they were attacked by another member  of the Dark Triad, Dante.
 An attack from the Spade Kingdom?!
 Rouge!
 They momentarily escaped peril  thanks to Vanessa's magic,
 and Asta fought back with his anti-magic,
 but they were no match for  Dante's gravity magic.
 You leave me no choice.
 I'll awaken your true feelings for you.
 Stop!
 Gauche!
 Gauche was dealt a mortal blow.
 Asta went berserk, losing himself  to rage and hatred.
 He was finally able to land  a strike on Dante!
 How dare you...
 mark me?
 I didn't want to taint my hands  with worldly matters...
 But you leave me no choice.
 Gravity Magic:
 Heavy Infighting.
 I definitely feel like beating you to a pulp
 with my own fists right now.
 Gauche... Gauche...
 I...
 I...
 Dante VS The Captain  of the Black Bulls
 How dare you show yourself in front  of me like that, you ugly child?!
 For heaven's sake.
 My daughters are so beautiful,  but you have to be so plain and gloomy!
 You made Mother mad again?
 Hurry up and do the cleaning,  laundry, and dishes!
 Sister...
 And you're covered in soot,  you filthy creature.
 I guess that goes perfectly with  your name. Grey, covered in soot!
 It really does suit her well.
 Isn't it perfect? You can hide how  embarrassing you look, you ugly girl.
 Wonderful! You should be  covered in soot all the time.
 Look, Mother!
 My, what a beautiful spell!  It suits you both perfectly.
 N-Next year, I can also...
 I-I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!
 What are you peeking in for, you ugly girl?
 You must be jealous of our beautiful magic.
 Because an ugly girl like you could  never dream of having such magic.
 A laggard like you could never use  any magic that's worthwhile, anyway.
 Just stick to your chores, understand?
 Y-Yes, ma'am.
 I have nothing,
 and I'm always getting yelled  at for being a laggard...
 But if I work really hard,
 maybe my stepmother and stepsisters will...
 It seems you've been sneaking around  practicing and not doing your chores.
 Did you finally learn a decent spell?
 It's been five years since you  got your grimoire, hasn't it?
 I'm sure even a loser like you must  be able to do something by now.
 Go on, show us.
 I'm sure it's going to be as  shabby as you are, though.
 Now I can finally...
 How dare you?!
 We're the only ones who received  these beautiful faces from Mother!
 Hurry up and turn back!
 Wait... I just learned how to  do it, so I can't really...
 You laggard! You stupid, ugly girl!
 We'll kill you!
 I finally learned this spell,  but I knew my magic couldn't...
 I don't know what they'll  do to me if I go back home.
 But could someone like me possibly  live out here on my own?
 Oh?
 Well, well, if it isn't one of the  young ladies from the Whiteley family.
 Are you all alone today?
 Do you have anything you can spare  for poor, lowly bandits like us?
 I-I don't have any money.
 I don't have anything I can give you.
 Well, you've got on some nice clothes.  Why don't we go ahead and take you?
 There's nothing...
 Grab her!
 I can do...
 Are you okay, miss?
 U-Um... Thank you very mu—
 Don't get the wrong idea.
 I only saved you because Marie asked me to.
 You're such a nice little girl, Marie!
 You're truly an angel! An angel  descended from the heavens!
 My little angel Marie!
 Thank you for saving her, Big Brother.
 I'd do anything for you, Marie.
 Oh, there are siblings who  are actually that close.
 How nice. I wish I had...
 Hey.
 What are you doing here, anyway?
 Huh? Well, I...
 You should probably go home.
 Did you run away from home?
 If you ran away half-heartedly, go back home.
 If you don't have the resolve to  get what you want on your own,
 you're not gonna survive  in this rotten world.
 I'm pretty sure Gauche never realized it.
 I had nothing in this world,
 but he gave me the light  I needed to live strong.
 I did my best to survive, and...
 You're hilarious! Come join my squad!
 How long are you going to stand there?
 Come over here and have a drink with me.
 Come on, you say something, too.
 What? I'm too busy burning the  vision of Marie into my eyeballs.
 For crying out loud... You're only  ever interested in your sister.
 Of course I am! She's an angel!
 Yeah, yeah...
 She's an angel, isn't she?!
 ...I was able to see you again!
 It might be overboard for  me to call this fate.
 But you're the one who led me here.
 You gave me a place to belong.
 I don't want to lose a  single one of my friends!
 You gave me a reason to live.
 And...
 It doesn't matter what form  you take. You're always Grey.
 I found friends I could truly trust like family.
 I want to save Gauche!
 And...
 It's embarrassing, but I want  you to look at me more!
 And see how much stronger I've become!
 Grey?!
 She sealed his wound?
 She can do that with  her transformation magic?
 What is this magic?
 Grey, you...
 Asta!
 Magnificent!
 To think there was another arcane stage.
 Your powers are wasted here.
 Both of you...
 should be my women.
 Hey!
 Keep your filthy mitts off my squad.
 Captain!
 I see.
 So you're Yami Sukehiro.
 You seem like one of those devil-possessed  from the Spade Kingdom.
 But I don't give a shit about that.
 I don't care who you are. I'm gonna kill you.
 Excellent malice, but you  need to know your place.
 Gravity Magic: Presence of the Demon King.
 I can't control my spatial magic—
 Oh? So you refuse to grovel. Impressive.
 I've learned a bunch of new  things these past six months.
 Guess I'll try some of them out.
 Mana Zone and Black Hole...
 Dark Magic: Black Moon.
 Magic of mine that's within his  territory is being erased.
 You go over to the rest of them.
 Y-Yes, sir!
 So this is dark magic.
 Well, then...
 I'll send this boulder flying at super speed
 and crush you with the inertia.
 Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Dimension Slash!
 He cut through space?
 Impressive. I'd expect nothing less  from an arcane stage that we seek.
 Gravity Magic: Heavy Infighting Gladiator!
 He's fast.
 I'm using Mana Zone and reading  his ki to predict his moves.
 It's not as much as Julius, but...
 He's using his gravity to control  the speed of his sword strikes.
 Splendid, Yami Sukehiro.
 You seem to know a lot about me.  What the hell are you, a stalker?
 Indeed! You're the one I'm after.
 What?! I gotta say I'm not exactly happy  to be in demand with a guy like you.
 You're a key that connects this  world with the underworld.
 The underworld?
 The hell are you even  talking about, stalker?!
 But unfortunately, it appears that Yami  Sukehiro is a rather vulgar and shabby man.
 Say that again, jackass!
 How did a man like yourself acquire  so many individuals with unique magic?
 This is the first time I've  been jealous of a human.
 Thank you for this new malice.
 But those arcane stage  ladies will now be mine.
 From now on, they will serve me and my ends!
 Captain!
 Arcane stage? Serve your ends?  The hell are you talking about?
 I only brought them in because I liked them.
 Mana Zone: Condense...
 Dark Cloaked Iai Slash.
 Ain't no way in hell I'm gonna let
 a creep like you have any of them.
 The enemy's attacking! Run!
 The queen's water will save us!
 Over here!
 Hurry!
 N-No...
 Those who have been bestowed powers  by the devil-possessed are this strong?
 I'll go.
 Gaja!
 If the Spirit Guardians don't stand a chance,
 no one else in the Heart  Kingdom could possibly...
 We need to stop Luck and the  others who went to back them up!
 Loropechika!
 I'm sure they'll be fine.
 So you concentrate on  protecting your kingdom.
 For both protecting the Heart Kingdom  and attacking the Spade Kingdom,
 Loropechika is absolutely essential.
 We will protect you!
 No matter how strong the enemy is, I won't  let us get away with losing, everyone!
 That was one of the Spirit Guardians who are  some of the most powerful in this kingdom?
 I'm so disappointed. But what can you do?
 After all, I'm... Lady Vanica's favorite!
 I'm a Dark Disciple with  50% of the devil's power...
 The Great Svenkin!
 Dark Disciple Svenkin Gatard
 Now, time for some cleaning up.
 Oh?
 Well, look at the cutie who just arrived.
 You're not from this kingdom, are you?
 Then you're probably better off staying put.
 Don't wanna.
 I like you.
 Well, your speed, at least!
 Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!
 My skin magic lets me be  as tough or soft as I want.
 I change the constitution of my skin
 depending on my opponent's  magic to nullify its effects.
 My body is the ultimate spear and shield!
 It doesn't matter what you—
 I just told you, it's useless!
 I'm way into the zero stage,  while you're first stage at most.
 You get it, don't you?  You have no chance at winning.
 You should just use that  speed of yours to run away.
 Why would I run away from such a fun fight?
 Ah, so you're actually a dummy.
 So why are you attacking the Heart Kingdom?
 Why, for Lady Vanica, of course!
 No woman is as powerful and beautiful as her.
 She is my ideal and my idol!
 Huh... So that's reason enough  for you to hurt people.
 That's reason enough?
 Then why in the world do you put  your life on the line for others?
 Just look at how beat-up you are.
 You're pretty selfish,  squashing people's happiness like that.
 Do whatever you want!  And I'll do what I want!
 Then I'll do what I want to and protect them.
 Because...
 I'm a Magic Knight!
 Hey.
 Show me how to do the true  lightning magic that you use.
 As the name suggests, it is a spell  that produces a real lightning bolt.
 Despite being a Spirit Guardian,  it took me two years to learn it.
 Aw, and it seemed pretty fun, too.
 I am an expert at discharge  spells, so it works out.
 What you're good at is equip spells.
 You can instantly form arrays  near your hands and feet.
 Use that to your advantage and  create your own powerful spell.
 Just being fast won't be enough to defeat me.
 Your magic won't work on me,  and you're already busted up.
 Why not give up?
 Seriously...
 I'm telling you it won't work.
 My skin detects your mana and  instantly auto-initiates.
 He got rid of a piece of armor.
 Well, that was a clever thing to do.
 In that case, I'll show you  how clever I can be, too.
 Skin Magic: Skin Fort!
 Magic Shells for all!
 I need to be... faster.
 You're a tough one.
 I'm sure your mana won't  hold out for much longer.
 I'll make sure to take good care of you  when you run out of mana and can't move.
 Even... faster.
 What? He only scratched me,  and I took this much damage?!
 Does that mean his speed is getting faster  than my skin's ability to sense mana?
 In that case...
 I'm just going to give  myself rock-hard defense!
 Now you won't be able to hurt me at all!
 More...
 What in the world is this eerie feeling?
 This is impossible.
 And more...
 My skin magic nullifies your magic!
 Faster!
 There's no way it'll work against m—
 True Lightning Magic: Ceranos!
 He went... through me?
 But that's... impossible.
 He turned himself into a  spear of actual lighting?
 Thanks! That was a lot of fun!

 Marie...
 Today's the day...
 I'm going to thank him for  what he did back then.
 Hey.
 Today's the day...
 Isn't Marie the cutest?
 Today's the day...
 She's so adorable it hurts, right?
 Today's the day...
 Isn't she cute?
 Today's the day...
 Isn't she cute?
 Today's the day...
 I've seen them do that often lately. What are they even doing?
 Isn't she cute?
 Today's the day...
 Isn't she cute?
 Nice communication.
 Yay, that was so much fun!
 I wonder what the rest are up to.
 If they waste too much time,  I'm gonna defeat them all myself.

 a devil.
 What Asta, who was born without magic,
 gained from the five-leaf grimoire was
 the power of anti-magic,  which nullifies any magic.
 Meanwhile, the Dark Triad  of the Spade Kingdom
 also possessed the powers of  the devils from the underworld,
 and began invading the other kingdoms.
 Asta continued to fight  while believing in himself,
 along with his friends...  to protect this world!
 Just being fast won't be enough to defeat me.
 Skin Magic: Skin Fort!
 True Lightning Magic: Ceranos!
 One of the Dark Disciples, Svenkin,  who attacked the Heart Kingdom with Vanica,
 was defeated by Luck after a fierce battle.
 Meanwhile, the Black Bulls' hideout  was under attack by Dante.
 Stop!
 Gauche!
 Grey was able to save Gauche, who was  mortally injured, with unknown magic.
 Grey?!
 She sealed his wound?
 She can do that with  her transformation magic?
 What is this magic?
 Asta was enraged after seeing his friends  get hurt, and his devil powers went berserk.
 But his attacks still didn't work on Dante.
 Magnificent!
 To think there was another arcane stage.
 Dante tried to take Vanessa and Grey,  who were both also arcane stage mages.
 But then Yami arrived.
 Hey!
 Keep your filthy mitts off my squad.
 But Yami was the one Dante was truly after!
 He believes the key to connect this  world with the underworld is Yami.
 Arcane stage? Serve your ends?  The hell are you talking about?
 I only brought them in because I liked them.
 Mana Zone: Condense...
 Dark Cloaked Iai Slash.
 Ain't no way in hell I'm gonna let
 a creep like you have any of them.
 Battlefield: Heart Kingdom
 Kill...
 Kill... I'll kill them! They will pay...
 Kill... Kill...
 What...
 Kill...
 What the heck happened?
 My body won't move.
 Wait! Gauche!
 I can sense Gauche's ki.
 He's alive! Thank goodness!
 That Spade bastard...
 While using Mana Zone with condensed mana, my iai blade...
 will never miss.
 I never imagined anyone would  make me use this magic.
 What the hell is that magic?
 This power is completely different  from the magic he was using earlier!
 What's going on?
 Envy, rage, hatred... I can't get enough.
 Splendid, Yami Sukehiro!
 I was bored... of absolutely everything.
 There wasn't a single thing...
 the could satisfy my malice.
 It's just starting. We've only  just begun, Yami Sukehiro.
 You will open up an even  more wonderful world.
 Yeah, just stop. You're creepy as hell,
 Mr. Psycho Hipster Goatee.
 You said something about me  being the key to the underworld,
 but I dunno what you're talking about.
 I don't have any mysterious powers like that.
 The thing that connects this  world with the underworld is...
 a magic channel called the Tree of Qliphoth.
 And to create that Tree of Qliphoth,
 we need dark magic and world  tree magic at the arcane stage.
 Yes...
 That means you, Yami Sukehiro,
 and William Vangeance.
 This guy knows about William, too.
 And what happens once this world  connects with the underworld?
 Devils will pour into this world.
 Once this world is filled with devils...
 It will be overcome with  every possible malice.
 Oh, what a delight.
 Wouldn't you agree, Yami Sukehiro?
 Yeah...
 Guess I'm gonna have to  take you out here and now!
 If anyone dares to harm this  kingdom's nature or food,
 I, Charmy, will never let that stand!
 O flames...
 Shine beautifully upon me and my hair.
 Oh, no... The Polnfrume Forest...
 We're finished!
 The Spirit Guardian's been defeated.
 Sir Potrof shielded us...
 You're truly blessed.
 You get to engrave
 Dark Disciple Halbet Chevour
 the beauty of the Dark Disciple  Halbet Chevour into your eyes before you die.
 What do you think you're doing?
 Oh?
 It seems an unsightly fatty has arrived.
 Sir Potrof! Charmy is here!
 Charmy...
 Charmy!
 Hey, Charmy. Did you sneak  away from training again?
 Want to take a break and have some food?
 You have an amazing talent! Let's do our best together!
 You won't get away with this.
 It's Charmy's sheep!
 Save us, Charmy!
 I guess your magic is as slow as you are.
 Oh, dear. Perhaps this is  what they call ""affinity""...
 Our spells are going  right through each other.
 But there's one very decisive difference.
 My magic is able to protect me...
 But your magic cannot protect you.
 Not only is my hair absolutely  beautiful thanks to the devil's powers,
 it's also the strongest!
 Charmy!
 You're so pleasantly plump, you'll have  no chance of escaping my attacks.
 Consuming food is idiotic.
 All you need for beauty is nutrition.
 There's no way you can beat me with my  beauty, strength, and proper nutrition.
 I'm done looking at an unsightly fatty.
 Let my beauty embrace you as you die!
 Hey.
 You need to shut your mouth. Didn't I tell you?
 You won't get away with this.
 Hey.
 You need to shut your mouth. Didn't I tell you?
 You won't get away with this.
 What?
 She doesn't even have devil powers.
 What in the world is this magic?
 Food Magic: Glutton's Banquet.
 Well, isn't she an agile one?
 In that case...
 I'll just have to cook her.
 What are you doing?!
 The Mana Method is my kitchen.
 And when I cook there...
 Any dish becomes delicious, so the  wolf won't be such a picky eater!
 It appears as though I created a monster.
 How dare you do this to  someone as beautiful as me?!
 Lookin' good.
 I'll just... help myself!
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la...
 True beauty and strength come  from a well-balanced diet!
 Thanks, Charmy!
 You gobbled her right up!
 The Fire Spirit Guardian, Sir Floga,  has also been defeated.
 I can't believe he couldn't  defeat them, either.
 What is with that attack, anyway?
 There's no way to dodge that!
 There's no way that Clover  Kingdom boy can win.
 Where did they—
 Well, he's tough.
 My attack didn't even pierce his body.
 But I wonder how long you'll hold up.  Your mana just keeps draining away.
 Dark Disciple Sivoir Snyle
 You're just going to get punched to  death by me, the Dark Disciple Sivoir.
 You cannot escape my  Eye Magic: Catoblepas's Evil Eye.
 The countless eyes floating in the  air can not only see where you are,
 but can identify your mana  and stamina, too.
 I can even predict your next move from where  you're looking and how your muscles move!
 When I use those eyes to lock on to you
 and shoot my magic shells made  from my condensed mana...
 They'll never miss!
 Damn it...
 Floga...
 Why not concentrate on your strengths?
 My... strengths?
 You have the strength to endure.
 You're you, remember, Leo?
 Sharpen your senses!
 There you are!
 Flame Magic: Profound Spiral Flames!
 You dumbass. I can easily dodge that attack.
 You may be using the Heart Kingdom's arrays  or whatever, but there's still no point.
 His attack this time took  longer than the others.
 That's because he dodged my attack.
 You can move closer all you want.
 I'll just have to go farther away.
 The enemy is moving, but just as I thought,
 the distance between us hasn't changed.
 He's keeping as much distance  from me as possible
 while staying in his attack range.
 I've never been injured or  experienced pain during a battle.
 There's no way an attack from a  simpleton like you will ever hit me.
 Endure...
 I'm not going down until I defeat him!
 Just die already. Man, you don't  know when to give up.
 It's true. I may not have as much  talent as my brother and sister.
 But with those two in front of me,  I've endured and let my inner flames blaze!
 There's no way you're gonna win  if you're just enduring, dumbass.
 Let's end this.
 What?
 This is...
 What is this giant array?
 When did he...
 I endured and took my time making it.
 All while you couldn't  keep your eyes off of me.
 I have to get out of this array!
 True Flame Magic:
 Crimson Eruption!
 Wow...
 I've never seen an array so big.
 It's hot, hot, hot! I don't like pain!
 I've never even gotten scratched before!  How dare you?! How dare you?!
 Thanks to all your yowling,  I know exactly where you are now!
 How dare you say that after all  the innocent people you hurt?!
 S-Stop...
 If you aren't prepared to get hurt,
 stay off the battlefield!
 You won't have your way, Dark Disciple!
 Wow!
 You're amazing, Sir Gaja!
 I hate to admit it, but you're  definitely on another level,
 even among the Spirit Guardians, Gaja.
 I somehow made it in time.
 I need to get everyone to safety and  return to Queen Loropechika immediately.
 They've defeated all of the Dark Disciples.
 Excellent work, everyone.
 Hmph. That's the least they could do.
 Thank goodness! Great job, everyone!
 My water can't reach where the  enemies were, so I'm grateful.
 It doesn't matter how powerful  their opponents are.
 The Magic Knights of the Clover Kingdom
 evolve when they're in battle.
 I sense the mana of some luscious girls!
 We knew you would show up.
 So we were ready for you!
 Plant Magic: Magic Cannon Flower!
 You're disgusting!
 That was a splendid attack, Mimosa!
 It's all thanks to the mana you sent me.
 Yoo-hoo!
 Such ominous mana...
 It's just been so long since I've  seen you, so I came to play!
 My widdle Loropechika!
 Petit Clover

 The Strength to Endure
 The Strength to Endure.
 Are you almost at the end  of your rope, Miz Charmy?
 I'm still totally fine, la.
 You don't need to push yourself, either, Leo.
 Nay! Floga has shown me  the strength to endure,
 and I shall use it to defeat you, my rival.
 It's hot!
 W-Water!
 Y-You can hop out anytime, Miz Charmy!
 A-A-Asta, you're turning blue.
 Leo, you don't do well with the cold, do you?
 The strength... to endure!
 My, but they're lively.
 Vanica, I will not let you  have your way any longer.
 I now have friends I can depend on!

 Meanwhile, in the Heart Kingdom,
 the battle against Vanica's  Dark Disciples continued.
 True Lightning Magic: Ceranos!
 First, Luck defeated Svenkin,  who uses skin magic.
 And next...
 Food Magic: Glutton's Banquet.
 I'll just... help myself!
 Charmy powered up her food magic  with the Mana Method

 Leopold, who had obtained true flame  magic through the Mana Method,

 Robero, who used tongue magic,  appeared before Queen Loropechika,

 Man, I'm bored.
 The three members of the Dark Triad  are also out right now, aren't they?
 Yeah. By the way, did you hear?
 There might be a spy from  the Clover Kingdom here.
 Oh, please! No one would be that stupid.
 Guess you're right.
 You there.
 What are you doing in Lord Dante's room?
 Ah, you must be the spy.
 Let's have a nice, long chat.
 They disappeared?
 Where did...
 Water Crusade
 My widdle Loropechika!
 You grunts next to her don't  need to be so guarded, either.
 I only cursed you last time  because Megicula asked me to,
 but we're going to have so much fun today!
 She's the devil-possessed  who hosts Megicula...
 Vanica of the Dark Triad.
 The one who killed my mother!
 Why did you attack the Heart Kingdom  if I'm the one you're after?
 Why did you target the places  where my people were?
 Well, I thought if I did that,
 you'd be even more willing to fight me!
 How dare she?!
 We've defeated all of your minions!
 You're the only one left! I hope  you're prepared to deal with us!
 What?
 You've defeated them all, you say?
 Man, that felt great.
 No... He should've been  rendered unconscious.
 Ah, Lady Vanica, I am so grateful.
 Thanks to you, I was able  to feel good so many ti—
 Could you shut up?
 Hurry up and take care of all the pests  who aren't my widdle Loropechika.
 Lady Vanica, please, stomp on me some more.
 You see? Thanks to the curse I put on them,
 they just won't die, no matter  how many times you kill them!
 Where do you think you're going?
 What?
 We've only just begun trampling  this kingdom. Long live Lady Vanica!
 Dark Disciple Hischer Ongg
 All the other enemies...
 Behold the power of love!
 All hail Lady Vanica!
 How dare you... How dare you  inflict pain and injury on me?!
 I was chosen by Lady Vanica!
 How dare you put someone as beautiful  as me through something so disgraceful?!
 I'll wreck everything with the eternal  beauty that Lady Vanica gave me!
 Looks like they're all still yapping.
 Bring it on!
 I told you, you will not have your way.
 But if you don't defeat me, they're just  going to keep coming back to life...
 Until they exterminate every  last person in this kingdom.
 Do you feel like playing with  me now, my widdle Loropechika?
 Let's go, Loropechika.
 Yes.
 Noelle! Let us fight, too!
 Right!
 Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Armor!
 We will defeat you!
 Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Blood Magic: Red Beast.
 What was that snake  supposed to be? An attack?
 Don't worry. I'll play with you girlies.
 I snuck some magic-controlling  weed seeds into that last attack.
 I can't move...
 But neither can you!
 Mimosa!
 Leave this frog to me. You two  take care of that devil-possessed!
 Both of your magic powers  are the best, Lady Vanica!
 Blood magic and curse-warding magic...
 Just like Loropechika said, she's...
 Uh, Loropechika?
 Loropechika!
 Ah! Yesh?!
 S-Sorry, I was checking something.
 Checking something? It looked  like you were just spacing out.
 More importantly, the Spade Kingdom...
 Oh, right.
 Each member of the Dark Triad uses two different magical attributes.
 Their own, and the one their devil has.
 Vanica and Megicula...
 I've fought them once before, so I will  come up with a strategy against them.
 Let us train toward that.
 Excellent, my widdle Loropechika!
 I wonder if Dante and Zenon  are also having fun right now.
 But I definitely get to have the most fun!
 It's widdle Loropechika,  and I get to kill her if I want!
 Loropechika has me. That won't be happening.
 World tree magic and dark  magic sound fun and all...
 But having to drag them back  sounds like such a pain!
 Dark magic?
 What do you mean, drag them back?
 What are the other two members  of the Dark Triad doing?
 What? Why should I have to tell you?
 World tree magic... Dark magic...
 The Queen of the Heart Kingdom  inherits the previous queens' powers,
 which includes their knowledge and experiences.
 This is where that colossal  amount of information
 gets realized in Loropechika's mind.
 This place is why she is called  the ""All-Knowing Priestess.""
 That's... awful.
 Loropechika!
 They're...
 If we let the Dark Triad have their way,
 the door connecting the underworld where  the devils live to this world will open,
 killing more than 90% of  the people on this continent,
 and the world will cease to be!
 What?!
 That's... awful.
 Loropechika!

 How could you do something so awful?
 People are going to die, too!
 I want my blood to seethe with all of the  blood of the strong people left behind!
 I have no interest in the  weak who're going to die.
 But who cares about the future?  Let's enjoy the pres—
 Indeed, we cannot let  these people roam free!
 That's why we will defeat  you right here and now!
 The fate of the world is in our hands.
 Mana Zone plus Mana Method...
 Water Spirit Magic...
 Ludic Sanctuary!
 This water cuts the power  of your blood magic in half
 and powers up Noelle's magic!
 Harder! Even harder!
 What...
 The lighter your armor, the more  you can become one with the water!
 That will also assist you in becoming  one with the water and moving faster!
 Valkyrie Armor ~ Mermaid Form!
 I won't let you have your way any longer!
 Nice!
 Aw, there was someone who could  team up with widdle Loropechika.
 This is going to be even more fun, then!
 Don't croak too fast, okay?
 Devil Power: 50%!
 She has this much power even  when it's difficult for blood
 to harden within my magic.
 As I expected... a normal attack  won't be enough to defeat her!
 Noelle!
 Nice! I'm getting even more fired up!
 51%!
 She only went up one percent,  and her power is insanely stronger!
 I guess you only think about  satisfying your desires.
 52%!
 Is that how you killed my mother...
 Acier Silva of the Clover Kingdom?!
 53%!
 Who's that? I have no interest in the past,  so let's just enjoy this moment!
 Just give up and let me lick you.
 We're never going to die because  of Lady Vanica's magic.
 We trained really hard so we  wouldn't lose to the likes of you!
 Not just for the world...
 Or to avenge my mother...
 You're truly magnificent, Loropechika.
 We've gotten so much stronger.
 Y-Yes. I guess maybe you had  something to do with that.
 But of course! Loropechika is amazing!
 Oh, no. I'm not that... I'm just...
 Just so you know, humility is  going to sound fake right now.
 My mana and magic are both passed  down from all the other queens.
 Well, your mana is amazing to begin with.
 It can't be inherited just by anyone.
 Since I'm so clumsy and silly,
 I wonder if I'm worthy of being  the Queen of the Heart Kingdom.
 When I previously fought against Vanica,  who is possessed by Megicula,
 I was frightened.
 And because of that, I was cursed.
 I am unfit to be the queen.
 When I'm before you, I forget about  my status as queen, and I can be honest.
 I wonder why.
 Saying this probably makes me even  more unfit to be queen, but...
 I'm...
 so afraid of dying.
 I don't want to die!
 I have so much to think about  as the queen of this kingdom!
 But I... I...
 Oh, I'm sorry. A queen shouldn't  cry so much in front of others.
 Seriously, what are you even talking about?
 It's totally fine if you cry.
 Especially in front of friends.
 Exactly.
 Noelle... Mimosa...
 How in the world did you just trip?!
 We...
 are going to win, no matter what!
 For our truly kind...
 ...friend!
 65%!
 66%! 67%!
 Nice! Okay, here I go! I'm gonna do it!
 I'm going to give it my all!
 70%!
 Noelle!
 That's what we were waiting for!
 We'll have Vanica use all of the  devil's power she can right now.
 We'll have her increase how much  blood she sheds from her blood magic
 and make her use up her mana.
 That way, she will use the devil's power.
 We should be able to go  head-to-head with her.
 And when she uses up all of  the devil's power that she can,
 we'll use our trump card.
 That will be you,  our mage of the arcane stage...
 Nero!
 Nero's arcane stage...
 Noelle's combative spirit  and fighting style...
 If you two grow along with Undine and me,
 we should be able to defeat Vanica,  as well as Megicula, who possesses her.
 Nero, you're doing this, too.
 I'm going to seal that devil's  power you're so proud of!

 Yeah, she's done.
 You can die now.
 Loropechika...
 You two...
 That's enough!
 No one cares about you anymore!
 You're no big deal without  Loropechika's magic, are you?
 See?
 So slow.
 Noelle!
 You're trying to get in Lady Vanica's way?  What a bad little girl.
 You just need to stay  put and let me lick you.
 There's too much of a power difference.
 I'm just not in the mood anymore.
 Not yet.
 None of that matters!
 This little girl...
 There's no way that what you're doing...
 should ever be...
 forgiven!
 Aw, too bad!
 That was a good last push, but your  little attack has no effect on—
 I won't let you...
 kill Loropechika!
 Point-Blank Sea Dragon's Roar!
 Red Beast!
 See? It's no use. Your attack  doesn't do anything to m—
 Huh?
 This is...
 What was your name again?
 Noelle Silva.
 I'm royalty from the Clover Kingdom...
 and one of the Magic Knights  from the Black Bulls!
 You managed to injure my body again.
 Absolutely magnificent!
 But I rather hate this unsightly magic.
 Very well, then. I'll show it  just to you, Yami Sukehiro.
 The true powers of a human  who hosts a devil!
 Bring it on. I guess I'll show you, too...
 The true powers
 of an ordinary human!
 We were keeping watch until we  could attack the Spade Kingdom.
 So how did things end up like this?
 Should I try to go back up Yami?
 Or should I go get some other  Magic Knights Squad captains?
 No, I can't...
 If I move now,
 he'll kill me instantly!
 Devil Power: 80%.
 So 80% is what you call getting serious?
 Where's all that mana coming from? Damn it!
 Well, Mostly-Black-Line-Faced Man?
 We devil-possessed share powers  with the devils in the underworld.
 Since these exchanges take place  between our world and the underworld,
 Underworld
 we cannot unleash 100% of our powers unless  we open the door to the underworld.
 This World
 Though I'm not certain about  the devil-possessed over there.
 Gravity Magic: Gravity Singularity.
 As long as you're alive,  we'll have everything we need.
 I guess I can tear off one  of your legs, at least.
 Hey, come on, now. That would've  been way more than my leg!
 Dark Cloaked...
 Dimension Slash!
 He managed to warp my Dimension Slash!
 This gravity's way more powerful  than what he's been using.
 If I hit him with Black Moon,  they might cancel each other out.
 But as long as he's generating his gravity,  I can't afford to lose Black Moon!
 I'll just have to get behind him by keeping
 my Mana Zone condensed  and my senses razor-sharp!
 No, wait a sec!
 There's no point in cutting him down if he'll regenerate!
 I need a more powerful, precise attack.
 I'll concentrate on one point.
 You were quite enjoyable, Yami Sukehiro...
 For a human, at least.
 Ya...
 Yami!
 Captain!
 Now, then...
 Next up...
 Right here, right now...
 I'm going to surpass my limits!
 I'd be a pretty lousy captain...
 if I couldn't do that in front of my squad!
 I'll take that condensed Mana Zone...
 and condense it even further,
 concentrating it to a single point!
 Excellent, Yami Sukehiro!
 But you cannot defeat me!
 Dark Magic:
 Death Thrust!
 Wha...t?
 I was going for a thrust,  but ended up with a cannon.
 Holy crap... Captain Yami really is amazing!
 My bad. I mean, you basically  looked like a target.
 Impossible.
 There should be no human who can  fight me when I'm at my best.
 No, but there is one. Right here.
 That's why I'm in this pathetic state now.
 How truly annoying.
 Thank you, Yami Sukehiro.
 He couldn't be... Not from that state...
 He's regenerating?
 My innate magic is body magic.
 The devil's power explosively  boosts my ability to regenerate.
 I cannot die, age... or deteriorate!
 But I'd rather not use my  body magic if I can avoid it.
 I detest how ugly it is when  I regenerate or transform...
 Because it means that I'm being pushed.
 Hey, come on, dude...
 This guy's not human anymore.
 But at the same time, it's oh so gratifying!
 Death Thrust!
 You truly are magnificent, Yami Sukehiro!
 Your instincts and techniques  in combat surpass my own.
 I am deeply jealous.
 But you see, I don't die!
 That one overwhelming power is enough to  make it impossible for you to defeat me!
 The world is unequal and unfair!
 There are phenomena that are  totally out of your control!
 Just like me!
 It doesn't matter if the talented  or those who have trained
 manage to miraculously point their blade  at my throat through trial and error.
 In the end, I just have to crush  them completely, and I will win!
 And that is supreme ecstasy!
 Captain!
 Captain Yami!
 I can't get close enough to him!
 If I get too far away, he starts  chucking rocks at me from all directions.
 This bastard...
 Captain Yami is fighting after  surpassing his limits, and here I am...
 Stand! Move, my stupid body!
 Damn it... Damn it!
 Captain Yami...
 Damn it!
 Yeah... I can't win this on my own.
 This dude won't die. He's insane,  creepy, and he has, like, infinite mana.
 Hey.
 I can't win this one without you...
 Asta!
 I'll kill you, brat.
 Hey, brat. Were you watching that?
 Hey, brat.
 Why are you wimping out, you dumbass?
 I don't give guys jobs they can't do.
 Do something about him in your own way.
 Well done, brat!
 What? Are you worried about me?
 You're thousands... No, a million  years too early for that!
 Right!
 Excellent!
 Entertain me even more!
 You'd better keep up, Asta.
 Right, Captain Yami!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 I Wanna Lick
 I Wanna Lick.
 I wanna lick... I wanna lick...
 I wanna lick!
 And I'd rather not be licked.
 Will this do?
 This is so sweet and yummy and worth licking!
 Then how about this?
 This is cold, sweet, and  has a mild yet rich flavor.
 This is high up on the ""wanna lick"" chart.
 Now we can put an end to  this pointless fighting.
 But something seems to be missing.
 Leave that to me!
 This is what you were missing, right?
 Oh, you know me so well.  Please, step on me harder.
 Impressive, Noelle. I knew what he was  asking for, but I could never go that far.
 Here we go, Asta!
 We're starting our counterattack!
 Right, Captain Yami!
 I'm going to surpass my  limits and give it my all!

167,"And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...
 a devil.
 What Asta, who was born without magic,
 gained from the five-leaf grimoire was
 the power of anti-magic,  which nullifies any magic.
 Meanwhile, the Dark Triad  of the Spade Kingdom
 also possessed the powers of  the devils from the underworld,
 and began invading the other kingdoms.
 Asta continued to fight  while believing in himself,
 along with his friends...  to protect this world!
 Oh, I just had a great idea.
 Hey, Megicula, let's not kill her after all.
 Oh? And why is that?
 I thought it would be better to truly  kill the wisdom of the Heart Kingdom.
 Oh, who cares about that?
 Let's take her to the Spade Kingdom.
 I just remembered.
 I fought some chick in armor  just like you, my widdle Noelle.
 If I remember correctly... Ah!  She was my widdle Acier!
 Oh, that was so much fun!
 Back when I fought her,
 she got super strong after  I took a child hostage.
 If I take her hostage,
 you'll get even stronger, too,  won't you, my widdle Noelle?
 Not that I really understand, but she's  your precious little friend, right?
 Right?
 No one's going to complain  if I keep her, right?
 Honestly... You never cease  to fascinate me, Vanica.
 Well, I guess we're done here.
 Loropechika! Noelle!
 Lady Vanica, are we going back  to the Spade Kingdom already?
 Could you wait just a moment?
 Just a little more and I'll have her—
 Don't talk to me. You're gross.
 Actually, I don't need any of you anymore.
 Huh?
 Curse-Warding Magic: Exploding Life.
 His mana is expanding.
 Lady... Vanica...
 What... are you...
 It's a curse bomb!
 You know that devil power  I gave you Dark Disciples?
 It's going to go all kaboom now!
 What?!
 Wait... Lady Vanica...
 Lady Vanica, you wouldn't...
 Please wait, Lady Va—
 This whole area's gonna go kablooey,
 but I'm sure you can  survive that, Widdle Noelle!
 Well, I'll be waiting in  the Spade Kingdom for you!
 Get stronger, okay?
 My wid-dle No-elle!
 Vanica!
 Black Oath
 The key here is definitely Asta's anti-magic.
 We have to somehow hit that  guy with Asta's sword.
 Damn it! I'm definitely holding him back!
 I'm only hanging in there because of Captain Yami!
 My six months of training isn't nearly enough to stand against him.
 More... Entertain me more!
 This is all just feeding my pleasure!
 If I don't try to use all of the  unknown powers that are inside me...
 Hey, you're watching, aren't you... my devil?!
 Welcome.
 Who the hell are you?!
 Well, that's cold.
 I'm the one who's been the closest  to you this whole time.
 I remember now.
 We've met like this before,  though you seem a bit different now.
 Kill...
 Kill... I'll kill them! They will pay...
 Kill...
 I felt your rage earlier.
 I'm not sure why, but you want to  defeat that guy, too, don't you?
 I should've had a real heart-to-heart  with you much sooner.
 I'd like to do that now.
 So please... lend me your powers!
 Please!
 Very well...
 I'll give you some of my true power.
 But as things stand right now, it won't work.
 I'll need something equal in return.
 Something in return?
 I'll be taking a part of your body!
 You're making a deal with a devil.
 Are you sure you still want this?
 Even if I become a devil...  No matter what I have to do...
 I have to surpass my limits.
 I can't win this one without you...
 Asta!
 Those words mean that much to me.
 If I can't get through this, there's no  way I can become the Wizard King!
 You're funny, kid.
 Join my squad.
 And then, someday,
 become the Wizard King.
 I will become the Wizard King.
 But before that...
 I want to be someone who can live up to  Captain Yami's hopes and expectations!
 Very well. I'll give it to you.
 Gravity Magic: Gravity Singularity!
 This is everything...
 that I've got right now!
 Fifty seconds.
 That right arm is no longer the same as when  I was just dribbling some power into you.
 It is power itself.
 Your body won't last more than fifty seconds.
 That's plenty!
 Excellent, boy!
 The way he's fighting... He's definitely  on guard when Asta attacks.
 Is there anti-magic coming  from his right hand?
 If Asta can get a clean hit in on Dante...
 We can win!
 Kick-ass job, Asta!
 Then I guess I need to...
 work a bit harder, too!
 You, too, Captain Yami!
 What's that going to do now?!
 Excellent, you two.
 More... More!
 Asta...
 Yami!
 Entertain me...
 Entertain me even more!
 Both of them are
 moving at insane speeds...
 But it's like they're totally in sync.
 Time Until Asta's Devil Powers Run Out
 Despite everything going on,  they look like they're having fun.
 8 Seconds Remaining
 Even so...
 Even so, in the end...
 I will crush everything...
 and win!

 Demon-Destroyer!
 You're mine!

 This is the end!

 Yeah, for you.
 We win!
 Well done, Asta, you crazy son of a bitch.
 Thanks.
 You guys!
 That was amazing!
 Yeah, you guys are just... You're amazing!
 Thanks.
 Damn straight.
 Did... you... win?
 I... What...
 Gauche...
 Gauche!
 Th-Th-Th... Thank goodness!
 Uh, Grey...
 Huh?
 I-I-I-I'm so sorry!
 Why are you apologizing?
 Well, well... What's going on with those two?
 What's the matter, Yami?
 He may be dying, but we need to restrain him.
 Oh, good point!
 Talk about a gigantic pain in the ass.
 You hardcore psycho stalker freak.
 Well, we captured the enemy's  top devil-possessed.
 Guess it's happily ever aft—
 Man, I'm beat.
 I can't wait to just dive into my bed.
 Ya...
 Yami!
 I screwed up... I can't move!
 Who... is that?!
 That's... the Captain of the Golden Dawn!
 The thing that connects this  world with the underworld is...
 a magic channel called the Tree of Qliphoth.
 And to create that Tree of Qliphoth,
 we need dark magic and world  tree magic at the arcane stage.
 I was concerned about the magic  fluctuation and came to check.
 All life is within the palms of our hands.
 You said all that, yet lost? How pathetic.
 A spatial magic user?
 You bastard!
 I'm still affected from the  fight with my last opponent.
 I'm glad I got him early.
 I'd like to take this one, too, but time's up.
 You're not going anywhere!
 Don't let him leave!
 The world will end!
 Captain!
 Please...
 Devil!
 You can claim more of my body if you want!
 I need to borrow your powers again!
 No.
 Your body can't move anymore.
 Right now, it wouldn't be  able to handle another deal.
 It can't...
 handle another deal?
 That's because...
 you're weak.
 Finral, please!
 Rouge!
 If we can just...
 touch the captain, even a little!
 Captain Yami!
 We have achieved our goals.
 N-No... Yami...
 What are we supposed to do now?

 Stirrings of the Strongest
 Right around the same time  all of you were fighting,
 the Golden Dawn's headquarters was attacked.
 They've been almost completely annihilated.
 I'm glad all of you are safe.
 Asta and Yami protected us.
 What's Asta's prognosis?
 Thankfully, he'll live.
 It's just...
 I don't know what we can do  for his right arm right now.
 I have no idea what will come of it.
 U-Um... Could you take a look at Gauche, too?
 At Gauche?
 The wound's healed, and I feel fine.
 B-But you should get examined properly!
 What do you mean?
 Gauche was run through with a giant sword,
 a-and I healed him with my magic, but...
 You did? But don't you  use transformation magic?
 All right, I'll have a look.
 You really got run through with a giant sword?
 Yeah.
 I wouldn't even call this healing.  His tissues themselves have been rebuilt.
 The true nature of your magic  might not be transformation.
 Then what kind of magic is it?
 I hate to say this, but I have no clue.
 Grey will have to find that out for herself.
 Right...
 We'll have Asta continue to rest here.
 The rest of you can return  to the Black Bulls' hideout.
 There's going to be an emergency Magic Knights  Squad Captains' meeting in the morning.
 The best thing you can do right now is rest.
 What? My body won't move.
 Where do you think you're going?
 Who is that? Is his magic  the reason why I can't move?
 You should probably head back in.
 I have to go save Captain Yami!
 That's not going to happen.
 The place you're trying to get to
 has not only the devil-possessed  you didn't stand a chance against,
 but two others who are equally as powerful.
 Your devil's forsaken you, too.
 And you don't know what's  going on with your right arm.
 How does he—
 Going in your condition  isn't brave or anything.
 It's ignorant and reckless.
 Still... I have to go!
 While I... While I'm here, Captain Yami is...
 Just leave him.
 I don't know who the hell you are...
 but what the hell do you  know about Captain Yami?!
 Oh, I know him very well.
 Huh?
 He's boorish, violent, and vicious.
 He's irresponsible, immoral, and insincere.
 He's honestly pretty worthless.
 I can't win this one without you...
 Asta!
 You don't know anything!  Captain Yami risked his life for us!
 But if he lost, he's nothing more than a fool.
 Demon-Destroyer!
 If you can't even defeat me,  there's no way you can save Yami.
 That's because...
 you're weak.
 If only...
 I was stronger...
 You're such a fool.
 But you're a good person.
 I like you.
 Don't worry. Yami's still alive.
 Weg?
 Who... are you?
 I am the Vice Captain of  the Black Bulls, Nacht.
 If you so desire, I'll show you  how to use the devil's powers.
 The Black Bulls? How to  use the devil's powers?
 Hey, Nacht. Who's the shrimp?
 This ki... That's a devil!
 Gimodelo, I regret to inform you that  you're even shorter than he is.
 Oh, come on. You know that  this isn't my true form.
 He's having a casual conversation  with that devil.
 You're devil-possessed, too?
 I am. This is my devil, Gimodelo.
 You really do belong to the Black Bulls.
 Wait, you're really the vice captain?!
 Yes, though Yami just  decided that on his own.
 Aw, but I wanna talk—
 Captain Yami?
 I can't blame you all for  not knowing about me.
 I've only been in the hideout once.
 But why?!
 Because I hate Yami.
 Huh?!
 As annoying as it is,  people like him are rather tough.
 There's still time before he'll die.
 How do you know that?!
 Because I've been undercover in the  Spade Kingdom for a very long time.
 I still don't really know you,  or even know if I can trust you...
 But...
 You're the only one that  I can rely on right now!
 Please! Show me how to use my devil powers!
 Nice and straightforward.
 I like people like you.
 Th-Thanks!
 But for the time being, I can't say  that I sense any talent in you.
 What?! Y-You say such mean things  with a smile on your face!
 But I'm sure things will work out if you  can figure out how to use your powers.
 Then let's get started—
 Nope. You need some good rest first.
 Huh?!
 There's somewhere I'd like to go with  you tomorrow, so just rest for tonight.
 How the heck am I supposed  to sleep in this situation?!
 I don't like selfish people.
 It looks like you're all here.
 Then let's get this emergency  captains' meeting started.
 That concludes the report from  the members of the Black Bulls.
 The Tree of Qliphoth, which connects  this world to the underworld...
 In order to create it,  they need Yami and Vangeance.
 I can't believe those two were kidnapped.
 They probably let their guard down.
 And they're Magic Knights  Squad Captains. Unbelievable.
 Such pathetic men.
 No... No! Yami's been...
 Is he all right? Is he alive?
 I haven't even gotten to tell  him that I love him yet!
 We did everything we could.
 But it wasn't enough.
 Even worse, our enemy wasn't  even fighting seriously.
 Well, isn't that interesting?
 I bet you got scared and overestimated him,
 Mr. Vice Captain of the  Golden Dawn who almost died!
 Jack, don't.
 Even as we speak, our world may become  connected with the underworld.
 Then what? The world's finished?
 We must act to prevent that from happening.
 But there are too many unknowns.
 So basically, all we've got are guesses,  since we don't know anything.
 This is stupid.
 Nothing's gonna come out of this meeting.
 I'm out.
 Stop.
 You'd better not be thinking about  infiltrating the Spade Kingdom on your own.
 What? Why would I go there for that idiot?
 Even if I did, it wouldn't concern any of you.
 You fool! Of course it would!
 You can't be allowed to do something  so reckless as a captain!
 I want to go save Yami, too!
 You guys can sit here picking  your noses as long as you want.
 I want to kill that fool just as much as you do!
 All of you, settle down!
 Lord Julius...
 Well, I'm glad you all seem motivated, at least.
 But... I dislike people who  can't even hold a proper meeting.
 H-Heya...
 Could you quiet down a bit...
 Captains?
 Asta...
 Who are you?
 An intruder?!
 Oh?
 I'm pretty sure I have every  right to be at this meeting.
 Four devils?! There were others?
 Devils? This man is devil-possessed?
 Who are you?
 He's a vice captain... with the Black Bulls.
 Lord Julius?
 He's been acting as a spy  in the Spade Kingdom,
 though I didn't know that  he was devil-possessed.
 The Vice Captain of the Black Bulls?
 A spy in the Spade Kingdom?
 I guess anyone could be the  vice captain of Yami's squad.
 I've seen this asshole before.
 Wait, you're... But your magic is...
 That man doesn't exist anymore.
 We're wasting time, so I'm going  to get straight to the point.
 Everyone, please sit down.
 As you all know, the gate to the underworld  is about to open in the Spade Kingdom.
 And to make that happen,  I'm sure the preparations for
 the ritual of the advent of  Qliphoth are underway.
 Yami and Vangeance will be offered as  sacrifices for the core of that ritual.
 Captain Yami...
 From that point on, over seven days,  the advent of Qliphoth will begin.
 Seven levels, seven gates, will open one by one.
 Ten devils compatible with the Qliphoth  are scattered throughout them.
 The deeper the level, the stronger the devil.
 The upper devils are equal to the Dark Triad.
 The devils lower than that are far superior.
 And...
 If the final devil, Lucifero,  appears, this world is done for.
 As the catalysts of the advent,  Yami and Vangeance will also die.
 Conversely, until the gates fully open,  they will both live.
 He managed to gain this much  information on his own?
 From the very heart of the enemy's country,  the most dangerous area...
 Why is the Dark Triad trying  to do something so dangerous?
 I'm sure we wouldn't be able to understand.
 You're all Magic Knights. I'm sure you've  seen it more than you'd ever want...
 Ones who will hurt others without  hesitation to satisfy their desires.
 They only care about themselves.
 Absolute trash who won't  feel a shred of guilt.
 I don't want to understand how the  ultimate form of that trash thinks,
 nor do I care.
 Irrational evil...  There's nothing that I hate more.
 Even if God and the devils  forgive them, I never will.
 That being said, I can't  defeat the Dark Triad.
 I'm aware of my own limits. I can  only do what's within my abilities.
 And that's why...
 I'm going to make him our ultimate warrior.
 Huh?
 Anti-magic has that much potential.
 In three days, the gate to the  underworld will be opened.
 Before that happens, we're going  to take back Yami and Vangeance
 and destroy the Tree of Qliphoth.
 With my magic, we'll be able to infiltrate  their castle without being noticed.
 We will then attack the Dark Triad  and take each of them down.
 Dante has gravity and body magic.
 Vanica has curse-warding and blood magic.
 Zenon has spatial and bone magic.
 Zenon?
 But my magic won't allow me  to take that many people.
 We will need to gather forces
 that have a chance against the devils,  with Asta at our center.
 Hell yeah. You'd better believe you're  picking from the captains first.
 Let me go.
 I know I'm being impudent, but please.
 Huh? What are you, stupid?
 Like we'd send anyone who's  already lost to them.
 Yuno, I understand how you feel,
 but staying behind and protecting the  Clover Kingdom is also an important job.
 Yuno...
 There's actually something I want to ask you.
 There is a resistance that fights against  the Dark Triad in the Spade Kingdom.
 The other day, one of them  snuck into the Clover Kingdom.
 They're at your hideout  right now, aren't they?
 What?
 Just who are you?
 Apparently,
 I'm the Prince of the Spade Kingdom.
 What?!
 The Prince of the Spade Kingdom?!
 Yuno, are you s-serious?!
 Yeah. When the revolt against  the royal family happened,
 I was a newborn, and someone apparently  escaped with me to the Clover Kingdom.
 I see. If he's royalty, then his  tremendous amount of mana makes sense.
 The man who's with me now served  the previous royal family.
 He should know a great deal  about the enemy and the castle.
 That's even more reason not  to let you handle this.
 That guy could be an enemy spy!
 Not to mention, there's even  a chance you might a spy.
 If I don't save him, there's no point.
 It's not just me.  Ever since the elf incident,
 you've all been suspicious  of Captain Vangeance.
 And I can't blame you for that,
 because he wasn't able to choose  between the humans and the elves.
 And that's exactly why, even though  he's hurting, he's constantly fighting
 more earnestly than anyone  else as a Magic Knight.
 After I lost to that guy, there's something  I remember as I was blacking out.
 Captain Vangeance was fighting while  protecting the members of the Golden Dawn.
 You should probably get rid  of some of your baggage
 so you can concentrate on the fight more,
 but you won't.
 And that's exactly why you're going to lose.
 Of course I won't abandon them.
 I made them walk down a path of thorns.
 Even so, they rose again without  cursing me and forged ahead.
 They are my pride and joy! They are my dream!
 It's because he fought while protecting  us that Captain Vangeance was captured.
 Even if he's a traitor who turned his  back on this kingdom once to all of you,
 to us, he's the kindest and most  reliable captain we could ask for!
 Yuno...
 That guy thinks he annihilated  everyone in the Golden Dawn.
 But we're still alive...  because of Captain Vangeance's magic!
 This isn't over yet!
 The Golden Dawn is the greatest  Magic Knights Squad in the Clover Kingdom!
 I'm going to prove that Captain Vangeance  did the right thing when he protected us,
 and just how powerful we are!
 I will be the one who  saves Captain Vangeance!
 What the hell's up with this mana?
 Hey, shut your mouth alr—
 Hey, could you shut up already?
 I'm storing up mana here
 so we can take down that bony bastard!
 Yuno's not going to lose again!
 Very well. I don't hate people like you.
 Who cares if you're the  Prince of the Spade Kingdom
 or the Vice Captain of the Golden Dawn?
 You'll always be Yuno!
 Now, we'll be leaving for the  Spade Kingdom three days from now,
 early in the morning.
 I will send you details of our plan later.
 This time, we'll be the ones who attack.
 I don't have time to cry when  Yuno's being this serious.
 If I lost because I was weak, that just  means I need to get stronger!
 No...
 I'm going to surpass my limits  and become the most powerful!
 Let's defeat the Dark Triad  and rescue our captains!
 Yeah!
 Then we should also ask the  Heart Kingdom for help.
 Actually, I haven't been able to  get a hold of them since yesterday.
 What?! Did something happen  to Charmy and the others?
 Each member of the Dark Triad  left their castle yesterday.
 Vanica might have attacked the Heart Kingdom.
 What?
 You're...
 I can't believe the  Vice Captain of the Black Bulls
 is someone who can use the devil's powers.
 What kind of training are we  going to do to make me the best?

169,"And in the clover's fifth leaf resides...
 a devil.
 What Asta, who was born without magic,
 gained from the five-leaf grimoire was
 the power of anti-magic,  which nullifies any magic.
 Meanwhile, the Dark Triad  of the Spade Kingdom
 also possessed the powers of  the devils from the underworld,
 and began invading the other kingdoms.
 Asta continued to fight  while believing in himself,
 along with his friends...  to protect this world!
 After a fierce battle,  Yami and Asta defeated Dante.
 We win!
 But then Zenon attacked, and Yami was  taken away along with Vangeance.
 Captain Yami!
 That night, Asta tried to escape the  infirmary tower in order to rescue Yami,
 and he ran into...
 The Vice Captain of the Black Bulls, Nacht.
 If you so desire, I'll show you  how to use the devil's powers.
 Asta arrived with Nacht to an emergency  Magic Knight Squad Captains' meeting.
 Who are you?
 He's a vice captain... with the Black Bulls.
 He's been acting as a spy  in the Spade Kingdom,
 though I didn't know that  he was devil-possessed.
 Back in the Spade Kingdom, the ritual  of the advent of Qliphoth was underway.
 Once the ritual was complete, this world  would be connected with the underworld,
 and Yami and Vangeance would  lose their lives as sacrifices.
 In three days, the first of seven gates  to the underworld will open.
 They must fight the Dark Triad  before that can happen.
 Then we should also ask the  Heart Kingdom for help.
 Actually, I haven't been able to  get a hold of them since yesterday.
 Meanwhile, it looked as if
 Vanica had destroyed the Heart  Kingdom with her magic, but...
 You're...
 The Devil-Binding Ritual
 You're...
 The leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
 and the elves from the Third Eye...
 Everyone!
 Where are we?
 This is Elysia.
 It's a secluded area in a strong magic region  located deep within the Heart Kingdom.
 This place is overflowing with  incredibly dense mana.
 So they're awake.
 Who are these children?
 They are the descendants of  Princess Tetia of the Clover Kingdom and Licht.
 Huh?!
 Back then...
 Lady Tetia...
 She's still alive.
 This mana... One of the twins she  was carrying has also survived!
 I immediately sealed Lady Tetia's wounds
 and rushed to Prince Lumiere's side.
 After that...
 When I woke up in the form of a bird,
 many years had passed,
 and I had no idea what became of Lady Tetia.
 But she survived.
 Her life was saved!
 Children born of an elf and a human...
 Prince Lumiere...  The lives you had hoped for...
 The new world you wished for...  is right here!
 This is the new village of the elves.
 Once we found out about this place,
 I felt as though I understood why  we stayed behind in this era.
 Why did you save us?
 Because Dryad, the guardian deity of Elysia,
 sent a divine revelation telling us to save you.
 Dryad?
 After receiving the divine revelation,  we rushed to the Heart Kingdom,
 but we didn't make it in time.
 But...
 All of you had somehow used your own  powers to survive those explosions.
 Thanks to you, the citizens of  the Heart Kingdom were safe.
 It's amazing that you weren't annihilated  when faced with such powerful enemies.
 You must've gotten even stronger  over these past few months.
 That's not enough.
 I couldn't protect them.  I couldn't defeat them.
 Even though we'd trained for  months and gotten stronger!
 Now that Loropechika's been kidnapped,  there's no guarantee she'll remain safe!
 We have to...
 We have to get stronger right now!
 Stronger!
 You're all stronger than we are, aren't you?!
 Tell me how you got so strong!
 Wow... Is that really how you ask  someone for a favor, Little Miss Royalty?
 Do you truly believe you can  defeat an enemy that you
 couldn't defeat after months of training
 just by training a little more?
 I know it won't be that easy.
 But...
 It's even harder to give  up on becoming stronger!
 Right, you guys?!
 Yes!
 I see.
 Jeez! I see you're all  still a pain in the ass.
 Then you will be able to become stronger
 by using the elves' esoteric art, ultimate magic!
 I'm worried.
 I hope Charmy and the others are okay.
 Gaja!
 I see... So that's what happened.
 We're going to attack the Spade Kingdom  three days from now, early in the morning.
 What will you do?
 We shall fight with you.
 All of the Spirit Guardians are safe.
 On the honor of the Heart Kingdom, we will reclaim our queen.
 Lady Noelle and the others are also  getting ready to reenter the battle.
 But it will be up to them if  they can make it in time.
 I see. Thank you for contacting us.
 I will save you, no matter what.
 I will not let him die.
 Wait for me, Yami!
 Thank goodness Charmy,  the other Magic Knights,
 and the Spirit Guardians seem to be safe.
 I guess Noelle and the others are training!
 I want to train as soon as possible, too!
 Vice Captain!
 H-Huh?
 Vice Captain?
 In three days, we will gather  the Magic Knights' elite
 and attack the Spade Kingdom.
 You're... the Vice Captain  of the Black Bulls?
 Why are you here now?
 Why have you never shown up even once before?
 Because I hate the Black Bulls.
 I'll do whatever it takes as long as  I get to operate as a Magic Knight.
 It's honestly quite convenient being  a vice captain. I can do what I want.
 I despise people who  can't do things properly.
 The Black Bulls are known as ""the squad  of good-for-nothings with more damage
 than exploits to their name,"" right?
 It sounds like you were involved  in the battle six months ago,
 but that doesn't exactly erase  all of your past failures.
 The vulgar witch who drinks all the time.
 The spatial mage who's so careless with  women that it interfered with his missions.
 The former convict who's a ruined noble.
 There's also... Though I don't  see them here right now,
 the obviously evil-looking  delinquent peasant,
 and the obviously evil-looking,  belligerent, mask-wearing peasant.
 Et cetera, et cetera.
 Though it's clear that  good-for-nothing assembled you all.
 Th-They're all good people!
 P-Please don't just judge  them by how they look!
 Well, if you don't want to be judged  by how you look, don't look like that.
 When evil-looking people
 or those who have committed evil deeds  in the past suddenly do something good,
 that twist makes them more likable.
 And I absolutely hate that.
 The greatest people are those  who are good from the start.
 In the end, you're nothing more than  good-for-nothings that Yami gathered.
 If you still want to save  that worthless man's life...
 Get stronger in the next two days.
 Hey, I've been wondering. What is this magic?
 It's shadow magic.
 I, and whatever I'm touching,  can move from one shadow to another.
 So it's like spatial magic.  That's super convenient!
 We're here.
 What's this place?
 Whose house is this?
 This house belongs to a certain noble.  A former noble, that is.
 We're here.
 Here? But there isn't anything...
 Shadow Magic: Dark Garden Invitation.
 Now where are we?
 For the next two days, I'll teach you all  I know about using the magic of devils.
 And as a result, you'll grow exponentially.
 So we're training, then? Heck yeah!
 Currently, you aren't using the  devil's powers to the fullest extent.
 You're just using the power  that trickles down from the devil.
 We are about to perform  a devil-binding ritual.
 You'll make a contract with a devil  and formally make its power your own.
 It's a forbidden ceremony that puts  a devil's powers at your command.
 A devil-binding ritual...
 This ritual will allow you to  draw out the devil's powers.
 This ritual requires a connection to a devil.
 Usually, you'd use a relic connected  to the devil, like I have.
 This will temporarily allow you  to summon the devil to our world.
 But you're a different story.
 Your arm, your grimoire...
 Your existence itself has a  deep connection to the devil.
 Got it! So what do I have to do?
 Summon.
 What...
 The devil...
 My right arm!
 To think you'd let me out yourself.
 Fight the devil... and win.
 Use your powers to make  the devil submit to you.
 That's the moment the devil's  powers will become yours.
 It's been a while since I've  come to the physical world.
 Devil... Is that your true form?
 There's something I've been  meaning to tell you forever.
 Thank you!
 Huh?
 Your powers helped me out  time after time in battle.
 Right here, right now...  I'm going to surpass my limits!
 This is everything...
 that I've got right now!
 The reason I've been able to fight  up until now is all thanks to you!
 So seriously, thank you so much!
 Did you seriously just say that to  the guy who stole your right arm?
 Well, that was the deal!
 I've got no complaints!
 You really are so unbelievably stupid.
 And that's exactly why I'm about to kill you.
 I can't let you do that!
 And, hey! I just remembered  our first conversation!
 A little dwarf like you  has no chance of winning.
 But you're short, too!
 No fair acting all giant!
 I don't want to get my butt  kicked by anyone like that!
 You moron. I guess you still don't  understand the situation you're in.
 Demon-Slayer!
 There's no way you're winning this!
 You just walked right into my turf.
 This time, it won't just be your right arm.
 I'll be taking all of you!
 Hold it, you jerk! I don't  intend to fight you!
 I wanna talk—
 Fight.
 You came here to become stronger, didn't you?
 Then defeat him, whatever it takes.
 If you lose... the devil  will take over your body,
 and you'll become a grotesque monster.
 All the skulls you see in the altar are  those who failed the devil-binding ritual.
 If you fail, I'll dispose of you and  add your skull to the collection.
 Isn't this... forbidden magic?
 Hey, is the devil-binding ritual  something we shouldn't be doing?!
 We only have two days.
 Did you actually think you'd become  stronger using decent methods?
 This is the world you stepped  into because you have
 no magic and wanted to become stronger.
 What are you doing?
 At this rate, he's going to kill you.
 No.
 He's not actually trying to kill me.
 I can tell from his ki.
 What are you talking about?  The one in front of you is a devil.
 Devils don't have any principles.
 That's right! Every single devil  out there is a piece of shit!
 This guy isn't like the  devil I fought before.
 I'm gonna steal your body and—
 Just because you're a devil...
 doesn't automatically make you a bad guy!
 Damn it...
 Because...
 You're not a bad guy!
 Petit Clover
 Petit Clover!
 Vice Captain
 Vice Captain.
 Come to think of it...
 The Black Bulls don't have a vice captain, huh?
 Well, you know how Captain Yami is.
 It's gotta be rough being his vice captain.
 They'd need to be able to  keep up with his drinking.
 They'd also need to be tolerant enough to  deal with any of his ridiculous requests.
 Th-They'd need to be powerful enough  to keep up with his heroics!
 And they need enough patience  to deal with his long shits.
 Man, that's rough.
 The Black Bulls...
 I hate them.
 In this world where magic is everything,
 there was one boy who couldn't use magic.
 He never gave up on the future,  no matter what challenges he faced.

170,"The Faraway Future
 Devils are born in the underworld.
 From the moment they're born, devils have  an established spot in the pecking order
 that cannot be overturned.
 Since I was born with no magic,  I was definitely at the very bottom.
 How do you like that?
 I spent every day covered in my own blood.
 You're so weak, we can't  even kill time with you.
 If only that didn't exist.
 All devils want to go to the human world.
 But because the gates of the  underworld block their way,
 the powerful oppress the weak,
 and then the weak oppress those  who are even weaker to pass the time.
 That's how shitty that world is.
 Go on. Cry and scream like you usually do.
 I didn't care about anything anymore.
 Not even about dying.
 Why, you little... Who do you think you are?!
 I thought I'd crash into the gates,  and my body would shatter into pieces.
 But because I had no magic,  I slipped right through the gates
 and actually ended up in the human world.
 Maybe it was because I had  no magic and was helpless...
 Or maybe it was because I was so beat-up...
 But I had no feelings toward  the humans whatsoever.
 However...
 Look over there! Those horns... Could he be...
 A devil! He's going to curse us!
 We need to contact the Magic Knights!
 Because I'm a devil, I was chased down  by humans with powerful magic.
 My body stopped moving,  and I was ready to accept my death.
 At last... this worthless life will be over.
 Hey, you're awake? Oh, thank goodness!
 My name is Licita. Nice to meet you!
 This is my house.
 Don't worry. No one else knows you're here.
 This is my magic.
 As long as something lacks mana, I can  put it into and take it out of containers.
 I found you while I was gathering  firewood and carried you back in this.
 But talk about a surprise!
 The other day, I found a  five-leaf-clover grimoire,
 but I didn't think I'd  actually run into a devil!
 You're... not scared of me?
 Why would I be scared of an injured child?
 Besides, you don't have  any magic, and you're so weak.
 Still, I'm a devil.
 Tsk, tsk, tsk...
 I can give you a run for your money  when it comes to being loathed.
 My body robs magic and life  from whatever's near me.
 Just like that.
 So I live out here by myself, away from  the village, so I won't bother anyone.
 But wait!
 Maybe it's because you're  a devil without any magic,
 but it looks like I'm not  stealing away your mana or life.
 Don't you think...
 this is destiny?!
 You should totally be my kid!
 Huh?
 A devil... adopted as a human's child?
 I couldn't wrap my head  around what she was saying.
 But...
 Come on! This way!
 Woo-hoo! Dinner secured!
 That human...
 Isn't this beautiful?
 Yeah...
 For someone like me who was  born in a dark, shitty hellhole,
 tormented for being a devil with no magic,
 and who cursed the fact that I was ever born...
 She changed my world.
 Just because you're a devil doesn't  automatically make you a bad guy!
 Because...
 You're not a bad guy!
 You saved me from the  suffering of being all alone.
 Thanks, Liebe!
 I... did... that?
 Liebe! What's wrong, Liebe?!
 I... am...
 Lucifero!
 To think there'd be a devil  out in the human world
 without making a contract with a human.
 I'm glad I decided to kill  some time looking for you.
 One of the highest-ranked devils?
 My body won't do what I want it to...
 What an excellent find!
 I'll use him and try to find a way to  manifest my own body in the human wor—
 Who the heck are you?! Get out of Liebe's body!
 Foolish human.
 Even though I cannot use most of my powers,  you're still no match for...
 She's... draining my mana?
 Insolent human... You must have a death wish!
 No...
 I won't let go!
 I'm never...
 letting go again!
 I won't...
 I won't let you...
 take my son!
 Inconceivable... To think a human  like her would get in my way...
 But I can meddle with a lower devil anywhere.
 I shall return.
 L-Licita...
 I'm sorry... I'm not very bright...
 This was the only way I could think  of to protect you from that guy.
 I'm going to use my magic to  seal you into this grimoire.
 By the time you emerge, I'm sure  you'll have grown big and strong.
 Live, Liebe...
 My beloved son.
 Mom!
 Hurry up...
 and hand over that body!
 This ki... is filled with an  insane amount of rage and hatred.
 And...
 Sadness.
 You must have your reasons, too.
 Then I'll accept your feelings and fight...
 And I'll win!
 You can't be serious!
 You're missing an arm and don't  have any magic! Like you could win!
 I'm totally serious!  I'm gonna win with these muscles!
 The true nature of the  anti-magic that the devil uses
 is the power to nullify magic.
 Since Asta can't use magic anyway,  this doesn't put him at a disadvantage.
 But...
 That's great, but I'm not losing!
 Captain Yami's katana!
 Without my powers, these would  just be rusted hunks of metal!
 No matter how physically skilled you are,
 you don't have any magic,  so you can't use spatial transfer!
 And you can't shatter steel!
 You'd stand no chance against a  higher devil's magical powers!
 You'd never be able to win!
 I was sealed within the five-leaf  grimoire and unable to escape.
 They won't get away with this... I'll kill them.
 I'll kill all of them!
 I hate them...
 I'll kill them!
 So I spent all of my time cursing  Lucifero and the other devils, and then...
 I gained the power of anti-magic,  the power to nullify magic.
 I'm going to use my powers to get revenge!
 And that was when the five-leaf  grimoire chose a human.
 By some twist of fate,  he was also born with no magic.
 It looks like I'll have to  use this human as a host
 to come back out into the human world again.
 Even if I have to steal  his body, I'm going to...
 Every single devil is a piece of shit!
 And that's exactly why I'm going  to kill every last one of them!
 Even if I have to steal your body,  my hatred is going to win!
 I'm finally starting to understand you.
 That must be how you really feel!
 What are you—
 You can't use magic or anti-magic...  So what the hell can you possibly do?!
 As long as I concentrated and read your ki,
 your movements with those swords  were super easy to read!
 You're right. I don't have any magic.
 And without you, I can't even use anti-magic.
 But I have strong, unbeatable feelings, along with all the people I've met!
 I was taken in at the church at  Hage Village the same day as Yuno,
 and I didn't have a lick of mana.
 On top of that, Yuno's hot and a genius!
 But still, he's my rival, and we promised  to see who would become the Wizard King!
 And that's exactly why I was able to keep  getting stronger so I wouldn't lose!
 Because I met Captain Yami  at the entrance exam...
 Because I met the rest of the Black Bulls...
 I am who I am today!
 That's not all!
 I've met so many people up until now!
 I fought so many enemies.
 Some of them even became  my friends after we fought,
 and some didn't... but I won't forget them!  I won't forget any of them!
 All of these encounters  helped make me who I am!
 Merit that proves they are the best.
 Why are you taking forever  over there, Asta?
 I can't win this one without you...
 Asta!
 This little...
 Even after the five-leaf grimoire appeared,  and I was able to use anti-magic...
 This whole time!
 In order to be like
 all of the magical swordsmen I'd fought alongside and against...
 I kept training!
 Is that your limit?
 I know you can do better than that, Asta!
 Yeah!
 No matter how hard you train,  your body still has limits.
 You still don't stand a chance  against powerful magic.
 But...
 It looks like all that hard  work wasn't for naught.
 You're not just fighting against  some guy who can't use magic.
 You're fighting against a guy  who can't use magic...
 and has fought against countless  powerful warriors!
 There's no way I can lose...  I spent so much time cursing them!
 All alone...
 All—
 I... win!
 Well done.
 Now the preparations for the  devil-binding ritual are complete.
 You will make a contract with this devil that  gives you complete dominance over him,
 and you will make him your servant.
 Just think, ""Obey me.""
 Then he will follow your every order.
 He'll be able to aid you as your familiar.
 That is the path you should take  to become the ultimate warrior.
 I see. In that case...
 Let's be friends!
 Huh?
 What? Devils don't even  know what friends are?
 Friends are like, uh...
 Hold on a second. Are you trying to  make an equal contract with that devil?
 Yeah!
 I said this before we fought, but he's  the reason I was able to fight until now!
 But I didn't know anything about him,  even though we'd been together all that time.
 I want to know even more about him!
 So first, we need to be friends!
 What are you talking about?
 There's no guarantee that  this devil will listen to you.
 There's not a single merit  in a contract like that.
 Nah, I mean...
 He wasn't fighting seriously to begin with.
 He kept saying ""kill"" and stuff,  but he was definitely holding back.
 You can't actually kill anyone, can you?
 You're someone who can hate or be  sad for someone else's sake, right?
 That's why we can get along!
 And that's why I want us to be equals!
 This isn't a devil-binding ritual.
 It's, uh... Oh! A devil-befriending ritual!
 He's a real idiot, Mister Nacht.
 He sure is.
 And it seems like we want to  take down the same guys!
 Let's beat down the bad guys together!
 You and me!
 Yeah, I can't believe how  unbelievably stupid you are.
 I don't know if destiny  actually exists... But he's...
 Hey, by the way, what's your name?
 Hey, by the way, what's your name?
 Name?
 What? You don't have one?
 Then maybe I'll just give you one myself!
 Liebe!
 Starting today, you're Liebe!
 He really is...
 Licita's kid.
 I'm... Liebe.
 The heck is this thing?
 My right arm is back!
 Thanks so much!
 The contract is complete.
 Unbelievable. That contract  was unprecedented.
 I never imagined you'd be such a fool.
 However...
 You chose what was right.
 But that doesn't mean people who  are right will always be rewarded.
 So you need to get stronger,
 to keep yourself from losing to unjust evil.
 Are you prepared to become the  strongest in the next two days?
 Yeah!
 Loropechika... I'm going to  save you, no matter what.
 Okay, everyone! Let's do this!
 We're gonna do this.
 If the enemy is tremendously strong,
 then we'll just surpass our limits!
 Because we're the Black Bulls! Right, Yami?
 I've been doing everything  I can to defeat Zenon.
 But as for the actual results...
 Why don't you stop hiding and just come out?
 I thought maybe you could use someone  with spatial magic to spar with.
 I suppose I should help you  out with your training, huh?
 As much as I'd like to handle this on my own,
 this is something that affects  all of the Golden Dawn.
 You've become stronger, too, haven't you?
 So I will gladly accept your offer.
 You're still an insolent brat,
 but it looks like you're able to  be a bit more straightforward now.
 I'm going to save Captain Vangeance.
 All right! Just wait, Captain Yami!
 No matter how powerful they are,  I'm gonna defeat them...
 and protect this world!
 In this world where magic is everything,  there was one boy who couldn't use magic.
 But he never let that hold him back.
 He trained through blood, sweat, and tears,
 and became stronger with his childhood rival...
 to one day become the Wizard King.
